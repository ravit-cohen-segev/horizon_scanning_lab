The dark side of cannabis: Risks associated with non-medicinal use Although the use of cannabis as a medical drug is currently booming, we should not forget that leisure time consumption -- for example, smoking weed -- can cause acute and chronic harms. These include panic attacks, impaired coordination of movement, and nausea, as Eva Hoch and colleagues show in a topical review article in Deutsches  rzteblatt International.

Using mouse models, the researchers demonstrate that image stabilization depends upon two proteins, Contactin-4 and amyloid precursor protein, binding during embryonic development. The study is published in the journal Neuron. ""In the visual system, precise connections between your eyes and brain help you see specific things and make sure those images are clear and crisp,"" said senior author Andrew D. Huberman, PhD, assistant professor of neurosciences, neurobiology and ophthalmology. ""Sensors in the eye also detect movement and connect to the brain in just the right way to tell your eyes to move in the right direction without blurring images, the way a camera does if you try to take a picture while moving. Until now, we didn't really understand how the eye and brain control that on a molecular level."" To determine exactly how your eyes and brain work together to keep things steady, Huberman, lead author Jessica Osterhout and team labeled specific sets of neurons in the brain that make specific connections -- a technique pioneered by Huberman's lab. This approach allows researchers to look at individual components of the visual network and eventually identify the exact genes those cells switch on during development, as they make the appropriate connections. From this, the team found Contactin-4, an adhesion molecule. They determined that Conactin-4's expression is very specific to those cells in the eye involved in image stabilization. When the researchers mutated Contactin-4, the circuit didn't form properly and visual cells didn't talk to the brain correctly. On the other hand, when they added Contactin-4 to a cell that doesn't normally produce it, that one additional protein was all the cell needed make the circuits for a steady eye-brain connection. Then the team went looking for proteins that bind Contactin-4. They uncovered amyloid precursor protein, which has been widely studied for its role in Alzheimer's disease, but is also known to be an important factor in normal brain development. If amyloid precursor protein isn't available, the researchers discovered, Contactin-4 can't control development of the visual circuitry. Based upon these findings, Huberman and colleagues hypothesize that there are also very specific sets of genes that make sure the correct neurons make the correct connections in other aspects of neural circuitry, in addition to vision. And these genes are very likely important for accurate sensory perception and behavior. Next, Huberman and his team plan to take a closer look at how these genes and precise neural connections go wrong in cognitive diseases. For example, since the Contactin-4 gene is located in a cluster of genes that have been implicated in some forms of autism, they want to know if aberrations in that particular gene might play a role in development of the disease. ""My lab is also interested in figuring out how to reconnect or regenerate circuits damaged by injury or disease,"" Huberman said.

PTSD is associated with number of psychological maladies, among them chronic depression, anger, insomnia, eating disorders and substance abuse. Writing in the May 7 online issue of American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, researchers at University of California (UC), San Diego School of Medicine and Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System suggest that people with PTSD may also be at risk for accelerated aging or premature senescence. ""This is the first study of its type to link PTSD, a psychological disorder with no established genetic basis, which is caused by external, traumatic stress, with long-term, systemic effects on a basic biological process such as aging,"" said Dilip V. Jeste, MD, Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry and Neurosciences and director of the Center on Healthy Aging and Senior Care at UC San Diego, who is the senior author of this study. Researchers had previously noted a potential association between psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and acceleration of the aging process. Jeste and colleagues determined to see if PTSD might show a similar association by conducting a comprehensive review of published empirical studies relevant to early aging in PTSD, covering multiple databases going back to 2000. There is no standardized definition of what constitutes premature or accelerated senescence. For guidance, the researchers looked at early aging phenomena associated with non-psychiatric conditions, such as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, HIV infection and Down's syndrome. The majority of evidence fell into three categories: biological indicators or biomarkers, such as leukocyte telomere length (LTL), earlier occurrence or higher prevalence of medical conditions associated with advanced age and premature mortality. In their literature review, the UC San Diego team identified 64 relevant studies; 22 were suitable for calculating overall effect sizes for biomarkers, 10 for mortality. All six studies looking specifically at LTL found reduced telomere length in persons with PTSD. Leukocytes are white blood cells. Telomeres are stretches of protective, repetitive nucleotide sequences at the ends of chromosomes. These sequences shorten with every cell replication and are considered a strong measure of the aging process in cells. The scientists also found consistent evidence of increased pro-inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor alpha, associated with PTSD. A majority of reviewed studies found increased medical comorbidity of PTSD with several targeted conditions associated with normal aging, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, gastrointestinal ulcer disease and dementia. Seven of 10 studies indicated a mild-to-moderate association of PTSD with earlier mortality, consistent with an early onset or acceleration of aging in PTSD. ""These findings do not speak to whether accelerated aging is specific to PTSD, but they do argue the need to re-conceptualize PTSD as something more than a mental illness,"" said first author James B. Lohr, MD, professor of psychiatry. ""Early senescence, increased medical morbidity and premature mortality in PTSD have implications in health care beyond simply treating PTSD symptoms. Our findings warrant a deeper look at this phenomenon and a more integrated medical-psychiatric approach to their care."" Barton Palmer, PhD, professor of psychiatry and a coauthor of the study, cautioned that ""prospective longitudinal studies are needed to directly demonstrate accelerated aging in PTSD and to establish underlying mechanisms.""

The joint work is aimed at validating the utility of the SmartChipTM technology for isolating single cells from various tissues and preparing libraries for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS).  Genentech represents WaferGen s initial partner in WaferGen s single cell genomics technology-focused Early Access Program.  We are pleased that our first Early Access Program partner is a pioneering biotechnology company with an outstanding scientific track record of innovation, such as Genentech,  said Ivan Trifunovich, President and CEO of WaferGen.  The development of single cell analysis capabilities is of significant importance in the pharmaceutical drug discovery process, and a substantial unmet need remains for analyzing thousands of cells per sample, and studying individual cells  responses to various chemical stimuli.  The SmartChipTM solution has a unique potential to facilitate the required scale-up at pharmaceutical R&D organizations. We look forward to working with Genentech to validate this approach.  WaferGen successfully completed separate proof-of-concept studies related to isolating single cells with the SmartChipTM earlier this year with both the Broad Institute and BGI.  At the throughput level scalable to several thousand cells per sample, the cell s genetic composition was successfully analyzed via the NGS method, thereby demonstrating increased discovery potential in a single workflow.  WaferGen continues to believe that the SmartChipTM technology will be able to yield a 50-fold increase in the production of single cells per chip versus current technologies at a fraction of the per cell cost. Single cell measurements have already resulted in critical discoveries of novel cell types that play an important role in disease mechanisms.  This type of analysis has the potential to establish a significant role in the development of an approach to disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment and lifestyle for each person, which is an emerging healthcare trend. WaferGen continues to expect that the Company will launch its first commercial single cell analysis product by the end of 2015.","Published: May 8, 2015"

But some substances, when they undergo a process called ""rapid-freezing"" or ""supercooling,"" remain in liquid form   even at below-freezing temperatures. The supercooling phenomenon has been studied for its possible applications in a wide spectrum of fields. According to this new research, membranes can be engineered to crystallize at a specific time. In other words, it is indeed possible to control what was once considered a wild and unpredictable process   and it may revolutionize the delivery of drugs in the human body, providing a way to ""freeze"" the drugs at an optimal time and location in the body. The study was led jointly by Roy Beck of the Department of Physics at TAU's School of Physics and Astronomy and Prof. Dan Peer of the Department of Cell Research and Immunology at TAU's Faculty of Life Sciences, and conducted by TAU graduate students Guy Jacoby, Keren Cohen and Kobi Barkai. ""We describe a supercooled material as 'metastable,' meaning it is very sensitive to any external perturbation that may transform it back to its stable low-temperature state,"" Beck said. ""We discovered in our study that it is possible to control the process and harness the advantages of the fluid/not-fluid transition to design a precise and effective nanoscale drug encapsulating system."" For the purpose of the study, the researchers conducted experiments on nanoscale drug vesicles (fluid-filled sacs that deliver drugs to their targets) to determine the precise dynamics of crystallization. The researchers used a state-of-the-art X-ray scattering system sensitive to nanoscale structures. ""One key challenge in designing new nanovesicles for drug delivery is their stability,"" said Beck. ""On the one hand, you need a stable vesicle that will entrap your drug until it reaches the specific diseased cell. But on the other, if the vesicle is too stable, the payload may not be released upon arrival at its target."" ""Supercooled material is a suitable candidate since the transition between liquid and crystal states is very drastic and the liquid membrane explodes to rearrange as crystals. Therefore this new physical insight can be used to release entrapped drugs at the target and not elsewhere in the body's microenvironment. This is a novel mechanism for timely drug release."" The researchers found that the membranes were able to remain stable for tens of hours before collectively crystallizing at a predetermined time. ""What was amazing was our ability to reproduce the results over and over again without any complicated techniques,"" said Beck. ""We showed that the delayed crystallization was not sensitive to minor imperfection or external perturbation. Moreover, we found multiple alternative ways to 'tweak the clock' and start the crystallization process."" The researchers are investigating an appropriate new nanocapsule capable of releasing medication at a specific time and place in the body. ""The challenge now is to find the right drugs to exploit our insights for the medical benefit of patients,"" said Beck.","Published: May 8, 2015"

Patients who experience fewer side effects are more likely to comply with therapy regimens. While side effects can t be avoided completely, they can be minimized with proper dosing and selection of medications, particularly in cases where multiple medications are prescribed together.  Anti-epileptic drug metabolism analysis has been part of our epiSEEK Comprehensive Epilepsy and Seizure Disorder Panel for over a year, and we are now happy to make it available as a stand-alone test,  said Kevin McKernan, Chief Scientific Officer of Courtagen Life Sciences.  There are a large number of patients who suffer from non-genetic forms of epilepsy or seizures, or may not need a genetic diagnosis, but who are being treated with anticonvulsants. The rxSEEK Epilepsy test is a unique precision medicine tool; enabling physicians to gain valuable information to help guide treatment decisions for patients suffering from seizure disorders.  The rxSEEK Epilepsy test analyzes the DNA sequences of certain liver enzyme genes involved in drug metabolism associated with 24 different seizure medications   including cannabidiol, the non-psychoactive component of medical marijuana. Physicians receive an easy-to-read report that classifies each drug according to the individual s metabolism profile. The test also indicates potential drug-drug interactions that could result in toxic build-up or loss of efficacy. ""As a physician, figuring out the right drug dosage for each patient can be a challenge. This is particularly an issue with anti-epileptic drugs, for which the therapeutic window is often narrow. There are rapid metabolizers that require high doses in order to see a therapeutic response; and there are slow metabolizers for which even low doses can result in substantial side effects,  said Richard Boles, M.D., Medical Director of Courtagen Life Sciences.

The new OH14 compound has been licensed by Tiziana Life Sciences, a British-based pharmaceutical company. It will now undergo further development before proceeding to clinical trials. Pre-clinical studies have shown it to be effective in eliminating a number of different kinds of cancers cells, including cancer stem cells from human breast cancer patient biopsies. The breakthrough comes almost exactly a year after the same research team announced that they had discovered a molecule capable of reversing the spread of malignant breast cancer. The multidisciplinary team is comprised of researchers based in the University's European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute (ECSCRI) and the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. Last January, state-of-the-art computer aided modeling enabled the researchers to identify an anti-cancer agent capable of deactivating a gene known to be essential for the metastatic spread of breast cancer. Using the same computer-based approach, the team has now been able to target the c-FLIP (cellular FLICE [FADD-like IL-1 -converting enzyme]-inhibitory) protein, known to play a key role in cancer stem cell maintenance and survival, described in previously published work by the Institute. ""Our computer aided drug screening process has now identified two new classes of anti-cancer agents, specifically targeting two distinct and novel mechanisms underpinning cancer,"" said Dr Andrea Brancale from Cardiff's School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceuticals, who led on the compound's design. According to the scientists' findings, targeting c-FLIP with the OH14 compound works on two fronts: first by helping to deactivate the tumour's self-defense mechanism against the immune system and second to prevent its regrowth. The main function of the c-FLIP protein is to prevent the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) from killing cells. TRAIL is a naturally occurring and crucial molecule that is used by the body's immune system to kill damaged or cancerous cells.  The researchers hope that ultimately human trials will prove the efficacy of the OH14 compound in sensitising tumour cells and cancer stem cells to existing drug-based therapies thus disabling tumours from seeding new growth after treatment. The new compound is the first experimental anti-cancer stem cell agent to have emerged from the European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute. Having acquired the licence for its commercialisation, Tiziana Life Sciences has committed funding for ongoing research that will focus on drug development.  Tiziana Life Sciences was founded in 2014 after licencing the BCL3 cancer agent that was developed by the same Cardiff University team. Dr Richard Clarkson, lead researcher on the c-FLIP project and senior researcher at the University's ESCRI, said: ""We are delighted to extend our relationship with Tiziana Life Sciences. OH14 is an example of a new generation of experimental agents designed to selectively target the pernicious stems cells within a tumour, thus improving the long-term prospects of cancer patients."" Gabriele Cerrone, Chairman of Tiziana Life Sciences, said: ""We are very excited to help drive forward this project in the promising new field of cancer stem cell therapeutics, and delighted to have extended our relationship with Cardiff University. This agreement further strengthens our portfolio of exciting pre-clinical assets to complement our Phase II assets of milciclib and foralumab. We look forward to working with the University to identify further inhibitors of c-FLIP. We will then seek to develop the most promising of these into novel drugs for cancers, such as those of the breast, where up-regulation of this c-FLIP is believed to be important in cancer cell proliferation."" Dr Robert Clarke, from the University of Manchester's Institute of Cancer Sciences, said: ""This is an exciting development from a Cardiff team that is expert in the mechanics of regulating cell death. The drug that they have developed appears to target cancer stem cell activity, which suggests it will prevent metastatic recurrence and be useful in combatting drug resistance."" Dr Lee Campbell, Research Projects and Science Communications Manager at Cancer Research Wales, who part-fund the study, commented: ""This is an exciting breakthrough as cancer stem cells are thought to be responsible for the failure of many cancer treatments and the re-emergence of cancers, often many years after the initial disease. ""Therefore the ability to eliminate cancer stem cells from the body offers the opportunity to totally eradicate stubborn and residual disease once and for all. As a charity we are proud to be associated with such ground-breaking research here in Wales and look forward to seeing how these new compounds perform in patients."" ","Published: May 8, 2015"

The mutation locks the EGFR into an active state driving the growth of the cancer, while also making tumors exquisitely sensitive to existing drugs such as erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib, which function as EGFR inhibitors. Unfortunately, after a median of 9-13 months, lung cancers begin to evolve resistance to these drugs. Approximately 50-60 percent of disease progression in this setting occurs through a further, specific mutation of the EGFR gene, named T790M. Results show that it is specifically in tumors with this secondary mutation, or ""escape mechanism"", of T790M that rociletinib is most active. There are no currently approved therapies for T790M+ NSCLC. ""This is a potential game changer for lung cancer patients whose disease is driven by EGFR mutations. Previously, once tumors learned to evade treatment with first-line EGFR inhibitors, we had no second targeted treatment. With these promising results, it is looking extremely likely that we now have a therapy that will keep people alive, well and in the game,"" says D. Ross Camidge, MD, PhD, director of thoracic oncology at the University of Colorado Cancer Center and the study's senior author. The drug rociletinib is owned by Clovis Oncology, Inc., which is based in Boulder, Colorado. Due to strong early results, the drug received the new FDA 'Breakthrough Status' designation, developed in part by Colorado's Senator Michael Bennet as a means to accelerate the approval process for very promising new medical treatments. In the current study, patients were initially given free base and later hydrogen bromide salt formulations of the drug rociletinib in ongoing 21-day cycles. The hydrogen bromide salt produced better absorption and higher drug exposure in patients and was adopted as the sole form moving forward. The most common side effect was hyperglycemia occurring in 47 percent of patients treated with a therapeutic dose, of whom 22 percent experienced Grade 3; no hyperglycemia events led to drug discontinuation. This side effect is caused by a specific metabolite of rociletinib, which has activity against the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and insulin receptor. The expansion phase of the trial is ongoing and continues to evaluate the efficacy of the drug in a larger population of patients. ""The rociletinib study is an elegant example of how far we have come in the last 10 years in understanding the biology of NSCLC and applying it directly in the clinic. To be able to test patients' tumors to determine the best drug for their specific situation - not only at diagnosis, but now at acquired drug resistance too - this represents precision medicine in real life. It brings us one step closer to changing lung cancer from a deadly diagnosis into a chronic and treatable condition,"" says Lecia V.

While few studies have evaluated alternative administration routes for these drugs, the review authors did locate the following: Inhalation: Inhalation is an ideal administration route due to the large surface area of the lungs, the permeability of vasculature, and rapid absorption. Loxapine is the only psychotropic medication approved for oral inhalation and must be administered in a healthcare facility enrolled in the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program. Intranasal: Although this route can have rapid absorption, there is also a potential for irritation. One small study found that haloperidol was promising for intranasal administration. Buccal: Because buccal tissue is less readily permeable and results in slower absorption, medications with a long half-life and wide therapeutic range are targets for this administration. A case report of amitriptyline tablets crushed and dissolved in a patient's mouth to promote buccal absorption was found in the review, along with a study on selegiline ODT administration for buccal absorption in which MAO-A inhibition was similar to a transdermal delivery system. Sublingual: Sublingual mucosa is relatively permeable and can result in rapidly absorbed but less sustained drug delivery. Asenapine is the only FDA-approved sublingual dosage form for any antipsychotic or antidepressant medication. Case studies have reported on administration of sublingual olanzapine, haloperidol, alprazolam, and fluoxetine in terminally ill patients and patients with gastrointestinal complications. Transdermal: Benefits of transdermal administration include avoidance of first-pass metabolism, controlled drug delivery over time, and modification of sites of drug delivery. Selegiline is the only FDA-approved antidepressant with transdermal delivery formulation. Case reports of transdermal delivery of fluoxetine, amitriptyline, and doxepin have been published, although transdermal administration of haloperidol and chlorpromazine have been less successful in small studies. Rectal: This method can have less predictable absorption but reduced first-pass metabolism. There are no commercially available rectal preparations for antidepressants or antipsychotics but case reports have described rectal administration of trazodone, amitriptyline via supposititories, doxepin, and fluoxetine. The authors conclude that development of alternative formulations could assist clinicians in treating patients with psychiatric disorders who cannot tolerate oral or injectable forms of medication and prevent discontinuation of drug therapy due to administration barriers.","Published: May 8, 2015"

Congenital heart disease is relatively common, affecting between 4 and 14 babies in every 1,000 live births. Around one third of affected children require surgery during early childhood. However, surgery itself can cause complications, affecting inflammation (how the body responds to injury and infection), the endocrine system (which regulates metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, sleep, and mood, among other things) and metabolism itself. Congenital heart disease is known to affect children s growth, and surgery and chronic disease can affect their metabolism and ability to absorb essential nutrients. In a study funded by the British Heart Foundation, a team of UK researchers followed 28 children (with a median age of 6.6 months) who were undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease. The children were part of a wider trial looking at management of blood sugar in 1,300 critically ill children and hence 15 of the children had their blood sugar levels tightly controlled using insulin, whilst the remaining 13 underwent the standard blood sugar control treatment. The researchers took blood samples from before surgery through to 48 hours afterwards, and analysed the various molecules present using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The researchers found a link between certain metabolites found in the blood and a child s clinical outcome. The greater the presence of ketone bodies   chemicals produced when the body does not have enough insulin in the blood and must break down fat instead of the sugar for energy   correlated with better outcomes. However, the presence of other metabolites such as citrate, lactate and alanine correlated with poorer outcomes. This supports previous research in adults with critical illness. The researchers found no difference in clinical outcome between those patients whose blood sugar levels were tightly controlled and those who received the standard blood sugar control treatment. Dr Nazima Pathan from the Department of Paediatrics at the University of Cambridge, who led the study, says:  We ve shown that the presence of certain molecules in a child s blood following heart surgery can help predict how well a child will recover in the crucial hours and days immediately following surgery. This opens up the possibility of us being able to identify those children at greatest risk following surgery and target them with the appropriate critical care management.  Co-author Professor Elaine Holmes of Imperial College London adds  Early metabolic differences in the type and scale of response to surgery may provide the basis of predicting downstream health outcomes in these children. We are now in a position where it is technically possible to analyse biofluid and tissue samples during surgery, which may provide a window of opportunity for tailoring therapeutic strategies in paediatric cardiac surgery.  Professor Jeremy Pearson, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, which helped fund the study, said:  Over 4,000 babies are born with a congenital heart defect in the UK every single year. Research has helped us make progress that means many more babies survive heart surgery than ever before. But more research is needed to ensure that those babies live long, healthy lives. Complications from surgery can derail a child s progress.  This study has shown a possible new way to assess children recovering from congenital heart surgery by measuring certain molecules in the blood. By identifying children who might be struggling sooner, doctors could intervene with treatments earlier. More research is now required to see whether such a test could give doctors that early warning sign that urgent treatment is needed. ","Published: May 8, 2015"

The Banting Medal recognizes significant, long-term contributions to the understanding, treatment, or prevention of diabetes. Dr. Scherer, who holds the Gifford O. Touchstone, Jr. and Randolph G. Touchstone Distinguished Chair in Diabetes Research, will officially accept the award when he presents a lecture on June 7 at the ADA s 75th Scientific Sessions in Boston. His research focuses on the physiology of energy-storing fat cells called adipocytes.  I am extremely excited about receiving the Banting Medal. Our research over the last 10 years examined the pathophysiology of fat tissue in diabetes and obesity and was done with a highly integrated group of UT Southwestern researchers, including talented junior faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, and students,  said Dr. Scherer, Professor of Internal Medicine. Dr. Scherer is known for his discovery of adiponectin, a hormone produced by fat, and for defining its physiologic roles. Adipose tissue previously had been considered simply as a storage depot for triglycerides, but Dr. Scherer s studies using cell biological and biochemical approaches, as well as mouse genetics, revealed that adipose tissue is in fact a highly responsive endocrine organ that plays a crucial role in metabolism and inflammation. His seminal work has demonstrated an initially protective role for obesity, keeping excess lipid in adipocytes and out of nonadipocyte tissues such as liver and muscle, which are not designed to store fat. His innovative contributions have been described in more than 320 publications, some of which have been cited more than 1,000 times, and comprise a comprehensive characterization of adipose tissue physiology.  These discoveries, combined with innovative methods he developed to study contributions of specific cells to regulation of metabolism, have defined Dr. Scherer as one of the most noteworthy and creative scientists in the field,  noted the ADA in announcing the award, given in memory of Sir Frederick Banting, a medical scientist, doctor, and Nobel laureate who is noted as one of the key investigators in the discovery of insulin, a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. Dr. Scherer is the fourth UT Southwestern faculty member to receive this honor. Earlier Banting Medals were awarded to the late Dr. J. Denis McGarry, Professor of Internal Medicine and Biochemistry, in 2001; Dr. Daniel Foster, Professor of Internal Medicine and holder of John Denis McGarry, Ph.D. Distinguished Chair in Diabetes and Metabolic Research, in 1984; and Dr. Roger Unger, Professor of Internal Medicine and holder of the Touchstone/West Distinguished Chair in Diabetes Research, in 1975. Dr. Unger, one of three ADA members who nominated Dr. Scherer for the honor, said his colleague continues to make major paradigm-shifting discoveries in the diabetes field.  Dr. Scherer s work has completed a pathophysiologic makeover of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, two of our most common diseases,  said Dr. Unger.  His comprehensive analysis of adipose tissue physiology and highly innovative approach to science have made him a giant in the world of diabetes research.  The Banting Medal is the latest and most prestigious honor for Dr. Scherer, who has directed the Touchstone Center since 2007. Last year, he received the Naomi Berrie Award for Outstanding Research in Diabetes. In 2012, he was recognized as a rising star in research by The Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas with an Edith and Peter O Donnell Award, and in 2005, the American Diabetes Association honored him with an Outstanding Scientific Achievement Award. The Touchstone Center for Diabetes Research was established with a gift from Mrs. Lucian Touchstone to support the development of new treatments aimed at ameliorating and ultimately preventing this disease.","Published: May 8, 2015"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/ngs-the-big-data-addiction-203201,NGS   The Big Data Addiction  The demand for ever more information by the genomics field began about two decades ago with the advent of microarray technology and has grown exponentially ever since   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Genomics has an obsession, and it s called Big Data. However, unlike other obsessions, this one will probably not ruin anyone s life maybe only a few late nights or weekend plans for the researcher on a tight deadline. This preoccupation was born out of necessity. It began as an innate need to understand how our genetic makeup controls every facet of human life, from our greatest mental and physical achievements to the debilitating illnesses that render us helpless to our own body systems. This was the first time scientists were introduced to truly large sets of genomic data that required quantitative analysis and training. Assigning values to tiny fluorescent grids on glass slides and then sifting through piles of information about which genes were upregulated or downregulated became a fixation for many research groups. At the time scientific presentations were riddled with heat map displays and descriptions of dye vs probe ratios, clustering, and normalization values. Yet, this was to be just the beginning of the field of genomics  fascination with mass quantities of data. The completion of the human genome project in 2003 not only had scientists feverishly searching for cheaper, more expedient ways to sequence genetic information, it further whetted their appetites for analyzing large datasets. In short order burgeoning next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms started producing exponentially more data, faster and less expensive than most thought possible. Now, scientists have become inundated with sequencing information at speeds faster than they can analyze, leading to an information log jam that has researchers scrambling for solutions.  Since 2005, the cost of sequencing has fallen by four orders of magnitude, and new technologies are allowing us to produce more data than ever at much higher rates,  says Daniel Meyer, COO at GenoSpace.  As data generation approaches commoditization, the greatest challenge has shifted to effective analysis and interpretation.  In any discussion about NGS data management it s important to have some understanding of the steps leading to the analysis phase. Even a cursory overview should impress upon the uninitiated the overwhelming amount of information generated from each sequencing run. The human genome has over three billion base pairs (bp), with chromosomes containing between 50 million and 250 million nucleic acid residues. To obtain usable information form these large expanses of DNA it must be first broken into much smaller overlapping stretches (known as reads). These pieces are typically in a highly disordered state and sampled randomly during a sequencing run. To ascertain with sufficient probability that the entire read is covered, sequencing assays rely on heavy oversampling, i.e., sequencing the overlapping stretches multiple times. Historically, read lengths were between 500 to 1,000 bp, which meant that even for the shortest of chromosomes, a sequencing project would need to generate close to 800,000 reads to be statistically accurate. Furthermore, prior to the advent of NGS technology, sequencers could only average about 50 reads in parallel. Using some quick math it s not difficult to understand why the Human Genome Project (HGP) took as long as it did, especially in the early days.  When NGS exploded onto the scene about 10 years ago, it revolutionized the field by radically increasing overall speeds and driving costs down. However, NGS technology didn t solve any issues associated with data acquisition size; to the contrary it contributed to swelling the total file size dramatically. NGS uses much shorter reads, currently averaging around 50 to 100 bp for whole genome sequencing (WGS), but compensating with exponentially more total reads and achieving staggering numbers (millions) in parallel over traditional Sanger sequencing methods, which drove the HGP for the majority of its tenure. To further underscore the enormity of NGS data generation, we need only look at some of the more recent undertakings of various international consortia. For example, in 2008 the 1000 Genome Project looked to sequence large genomic regions from 1,000 individuals among various populations groups around the globe. In 2012 the project team published their findings from 1,092 individuals amid 14 distinct population groups. By way of reference, using mainly Sanger sequencing it took the HGP 13 years to sequence one genome. Additionally, by the time they are complete the UK10K project and International Cancer Genome Consortium will have sequenced 10,000 and 50,000 genomes respectively generating petabytes (1 petabyte = 1000 terabytes) of raw sequencing data.  Life sciences  big data obsession is only a small portion of a larger issue that has been bubbling beneath the surface ever since NGS made its debut. In many respects it s a problem of infrastructure. Most investigators have little to no capacity for analyzing datasets from modern NGS platforms that are useful and reproducible by others in the field. For example, the raw data from a whole exome sequencing (WES) run that has a 100 bp average read length and 50X coverage is roughly 1 1.5 terabytes and with multiple replicates for improved statistics, one individual s exome could average between 3 5 terabytes of storage space. While the price for computer memory is always falling, having enough hard drive space to store data from multiple runs and multiple exomes could get expensive very quickly. Once the raw sequence data is obtained from the sequencer the heavy lifting for computational devices begins with the read mapping phase. The computer attempts to align the short reads either back to a reference sequence or uses overlapping sequences at the end of each read to generate a de novo sequence.  Our ability to measure outweighs our ability to interpret and apply,  says Mike Lelivelt, Ph.D., senior director of bioinformatic products at Thermo Fisher Scientific.  What is truly rate limiting is clinical interpretation of a genetic marker.  While data acquisition and management is a concern for many institutions, not everyone agrees that it is the all-encompassing stumbling block that is preventing NGS from becoming an integral part of precision medicine.  I actually think the thing that s holding back NGS from the clinic is reimbursement, not data analysis,  says Shawn Baker, Ph.D., Chief Science Officer at AllSeq.  It is true that trying to analyze all the variants from a whole genome analysis is quite challenging, but if no one is paying, it doesn t matter how simple and straight forward the data analysis process is.  Sean Scott, VP of Clinical Genomics at Qiagen, has a similar stance stating that the  demonstration of actionability and clinical utility of NGS tests is still a growing issue for clinical labs, needing payer reimbursement for the economics to become favorable for the lab and the greater community.  What can be agreed upon is that there are plenty of areas of NGS that require standardization for it to live up to its potential as an extremely powerful tool for use in clinical medicine.  I believe we are going to need the standardization and validation of algorithms on real world data to advance the use of NGS in the clinic and hopefully lead to a more phenotypic rather than disease term approach to treatment,  says Mark Hughes, Ph.D., Senior Product Manager for Thomson Reuters  MetaCore . It s often said that the only cure for an obsession is to get a new one. At the moment it would seem that is easier said than done for the field of genomics, but as scientists are always looking for easier, faster, and more efficient analysis methods, it will come as little shock when researchers move on to the next ground breaking application. For now however, the future of NGS and Big Data should provide investigators with improved methods that will simplify the data output stream and the management of that information for use with various bioinformatics analysis programs.  I believe that Cloud computing, and the ability to co-locate big data with highly scalable computing resources, is already making a positive impact on streamlining data analysis  and that this trend will continue as more data and a wider variety of analysis applications moves into the cloud,  says Scott Kahn, Ph.D., VP of Commercial Enterprise Informatics at Illumina. Dr. Lelivelt is in agreement adding that,  while data security must be the first priority, the benefit of centralized data storage and scalable computing resources will drive the clinical analysis into the Cloud.  Additionally, advances on the sequencing side could indirectly aid the data analysis stream, allowing for more accurate read alignments and opening up opportunities for new investigational methodology.  The most interesting thing that s on the visible horizon is long reads,  explains Dr. Baker.  Getting truly long reads (>10kb) will dramatically improve the alignment process and allow for new analyses like haplotyping that just aren t possible with short reads. Long read technology is available, but it s still an order of magnitude or two more expensive than the best short read platforms.  Lastly, another interesting technology waiting for its time in the spotlight, is third-generation sequencing technology. This method skips the DNA amplification technique, avoiding PCR bias, and allows for genetic material to be sequenced directly at the single-molecule level through the use of engineered polymerases that can tolerate longer average read lengths. Currently, only a few companies provide platforms for this sequencing method and it comes at a premium cost. Regardless of the analysis method, scientists will always try to improve ways to pour over mountains of data for that small nugget of info that may lead them to that career defining discovery.

Enzymes are typically proteins that act to catalyze biochemical reactions in the cell. Understanding what an enzyme looks like, both with and without a drug bound to it, allows scientists to design new drugs that can either block that enzyme's function (if the function is responsible for a disease), or enhance its activity (if lack of activity is causing a problem).  This represents a new era in imaging of proteins in humans with immense implications for drug design,  said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.  This near-atomic level of imaging provides detailed information about the keys that unlock cellular processes.  Drug development efforts often involve mapping contacts between small molecules and their binding sites on proteins. These mappings require the highest possible resolutions so that the shape of the protein chain can be traced and the hydrogen bonds between the protein and the small molecules it interacts with can be discerned. In this study, the researchers were able to visualize beta-galactosidase at a resolution of 2.2 angstroms (or     about a billionth of a meter in size), which is comparable to the level of detail that has thus far been obtained only by using X-ray crystallography. At these high resolutions, there is enough information in the structure to reliably assist drug design and development efforts. To determine structures by cryo-EM, protein suspensions are flash-frozen at liquid nitrogen temperatures (-196 C to -210 C , or -320 F to -346 F) so the water around the protein molecules stays liquid-like. The suspensions are then imaged with electrons to obtain molecular images that are averaged together to discern a three-dimensional (3D) protein structure.  The fact that cryo-EM technology allows us to image a relatively small protein at high resolution in a near-native environment, and knowing that the structure hasn t been changed by crystallization, that s a game-changer,  said Dr. Subramaniam. In the study, using about 40,000 molecular images, the researchers were able to compute a 2.2   resolution map of the structure of beta-galactosidase bound to PETG. This map not only allowed the researchers to determine the positioning of PETG in the binding pocket but also enabled them to pick out individual ions and water molecules within the structure and to visualize in great detail the arrangement of the amino acids that make up the protein. Dr. Subramaniam and colleagues have recently used cryo-EM to understand the functioning of a variety of medically important molecular machines, such as the envelope glycoproteins on HIV and glutamate receptors found in brain cells. Their new finding, however, represents the highest resolution that they or others have achieved to date for a structure determined by cryo-EM.  Cryo-EM is positioned to become an even more useful tool in structural biology and cancer drug development,  said Douglas Lowy, M.D., acting director, NCI.  Even for proteins that are not amenable to crystallization, it could enable determination of their 3D structures at high resolution. ","Published: May 8, 2015"

With our unprecedented speeds and data accuracy, researchers and commercial seed and animal breeders can accelerate development of the most necessary key traits to achieve global food targets.  Because of the speed and accuracy of NRGene s big data genomic analysis, the entire mapping process was done exceptionally cost effectively. The analysis was created in cooperation with an academic consortium including the Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis; Cornell University; Iowa State University; University of Florida; Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey; and Boyce Thompson Institute. The genome s accuracy was analyzed by world-renown agricultural genetics professors across multiple labs. NRGene s computerized equipment built the W22 genome by assembling 2 billion short DNA sequences into 367 very long and perfectly ordered sequences to create a maize reference genome in less than a day and a half, according to the company. The company provided an explanation that only genomic lab scientists are likely to understand.  The system used raw data from x180 short Illumina reads of the plant itself. It was assembled to an accuracy level of N50>8.2 million bp and N90>590 kbp, with unfilled gaps of less than 5 percent. Ninety percent of the maize genome is presented by only 367 scaffolds. An N50 greater than 1 million translates into highly accurate, useable data.  Researchers can further analyze the W22 information using NRGene s proprietary computerized equipment, which integrates, analyzes, and stores all genomic data, allowing for data synchronization and sharing among molecular breeders, bioinformaticians, and the breeding team.   NRGene delivers practical information to drive breeding decision-making to enhance productivity, disease resistance, adaptability and hardiness using big data genomic analysis,  the company news release noted. The company claims to be doing the most complex genome analysis at speeds never before seen, with rates that make it affordable for every sector   academia, non-profit, and the private sector.  Before NRGene s breakthrough technology, only a single corn genome had been mapped. Thanks to NRGene, scientists now have the complete genome of five species of corn,  the company announced.  With five complete genomes, researchers can more easily increase corn productivity, hardiness, and all aspects of corn production,  added Ronen.  Almost one billion tons of corn are produced every year, and NRGene s technology will allow that number to increase rapidly. ","Published: May 8, 2015"

The work is noteworthy because the disease, a brain stem cancer called diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, is nearly always fatal and lacks an effective treatment.  There have been over 200 clinical trials of chemotherapy drugs for DIPG, and none have shown any survival benefit,  said Michelle Monje, MD, PhD, assistant professor of neurology at Stanford and a senior author of the paper.  But those trials were conducted before we knew anything about the unique biology of this tumor.  While the preclinical data in the new study are encouraging, Monje cautioned that the drug, panobionstat, needs further testing in a closely monitored human clinical trial. The research team is now planning such a trial in children with DIPG. Panobinostat was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of a form of blood cancer. The drug repairs a portion of the cellular machinery now known to be defective in DIPG tumor cells, the new research showed.  A key thing that is wrong with DIPG cancer cells gets corrected by panobinostat,  said Monje, who also treats DIPG patients in her role as a pediatric neuro-oncologist at Lucile Packard Children s Hospital Stanford. However, the new data also showed that some DIPG cells develop resistance to the drug, which means it will likely need to be combined with other drugs to achieve the best results in humans.  I don t think this is a cure, but I do think it will help,  she said. DIPG affects 200-400 school-aged children in the United States each year and has a five-year survival rate of less than 1 percent; half of patients die within nine months of diagnosis. Radiation gives only a temporary reprieve from the tumor s growth. In addition, it is inoperable: It grows through the brain stem, where breathing and heartbeat are controlled,  with the healthy and diseased cells tangled like two colors of wool knitted together,  Monje said. The tumor has also been difficult to study. Because it is not surgically removed nor is it typically biopsied, for decades researchers lacked DIPG tissue to examine in a lab. That changed about six years ago, when Monje and other scientists began asking patients  families to consider donating tumors for research after patients  deaths. As a result, in 2009, a study led by Monje was the first in the world to report establishment of a line of DIPG cells that could be studied in a dish. Recently, researchers have determined that 80 percent of DIPG tumors have a mutation in histone 3, one of the proteins that packages DNA. The mutation damages the regulation of DNA in cells involved in the cancer   a form of epigenetic change. In the new study, the research team screened 16 DIPG cell lines derived from patients  tumors against 83 possible chemotherapy drugs, exposing cells to small samples of each drug. The drugs were chosen because they were thought to have possible effects against brain tumors and were already used in humans or were being developed for human use. Of the 83 drugs, only a small number showed promise in slowing tumor cells  growth. The team tracked six of the drugs  dose-response relationship on DIPG cells and selected panobinostat for further study. They then confirmed the potency and mechanism of panobinostat against DIPG and showed that it normalized some of the detrimental epigenetic changes in the cells and also decreased the expression of genes associated with cancer cell growth. The team further demonstrated that, in mice that had DIPG tumors implanted in their brain stems, infusing panobinostat directly into the brain stem slowed tumor growth. They also gave the drug systemically by injecting it into mice with DIPG tumors, and showed that enough panobinostat reached the brain stem to prolong the animals  survival. In a dish, DIPG cells that survived initial doses of panobinostat developed some resistance to the drug, the study found. However, the team also found that a chemical called GSKJ4, which had previously been shown to inhibit DIPG cells, worked synergistically with panobinostat, with the two agents counteracting known mechanisms of epigenetic dysfunction in the DIPG cells. Although GSKJ4 is not approved as a drug, the finding raises the possibility of developing combinations of drugs to treat DIPG.  Clearly, the next step is to find out what we can safely combine with panobinostat to increase its efficacy,  Monje said. In addition to the planned clinical trial, which will test whether panobinostat alone improves survival time in children with DIPG, her team will also screen other drugs in combination with panobinostat.  The goal is multimodal treatment to improve outcomes for children with DIPG,  she said.","Published: May 8, 2015"

It s all part of a growing new subfield of epigenetics being pioneered by Professor Chuan He and his collaborators. Through epigenetics, organisms sometimes bypass the genetic code to transmit certain traits to their offspring. DNA modifications, without changing DNA sequence, carry out those transmissions.  The human genome is not static. It contains dynamic DNA modifications that carry key inheritable epigenetic information passed among generations of cells,  said He, the John T. Wilson Distinguished Service Professor in Chemistry and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. DNA encodes genetic information in its chemical bases: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Previously, scientists had viewed methylated cytosine as the dominant DNA modification found in eukaryotes, a taxonomical classification that includes mammals, insects, worms, plants, and algae. Now, teams from the University of Chicago, Harvard and in China have identified an adenine DNA methylation that also epigenetically regulates cellular function in green algae, worms and flies. Their three papers were published online April 30 in the journal Cell. He s research group contributed to all three Cell papers, which report the presence and function of N6-methyladenine (6mA) in the three organisms.  The conservation of this modification from simple unicellular eukaryotes to vastly different worms and flies indicates its wide presence and functional roles,  He said.  All three studies together uncover a potential new epigenetic mark on eukaryotic DNA. They open a new field of biology and chemical biology.  Worms and flies were not previously known to contain DNA methylations. The presence of 6mA in green algae (Chlamydomonas) has been known for more than 30 years, He said, but the phenomenon went largely unexplored.  No one had any idea what it does inside green algae.  In one of the Cell papers, He and 13 co-authors, including Laurens Mets, associate professor in molecular genetics and cell biology at UChicago, unveiled the function of 6mA in Chlamydomonas, a green algae of potential use in biofuel production.  Genes that have methylated cytosine have been associated with reduced gene expression,  said Mets, who counts Chlamydomonas among his research specialties.  What s different about adenine methylation is that it is associated with more strongly expressed genes. It s a missing piece in the puzzle of regulation at the DNA modification level, and that s an exciting thing.  In 2011, He s group opened the new research field of RNA epigenetics. That year his group reported that the FTO protein, which is associated with obesity, can remove 6mA from the messenger RNA of mammalian cells. In subsequent research, He s group discovered and described the writer, eraser and reader proteins of methylated RNA. Additional studies conducted by researchers globally also have shown the functional significance of RNA methylation in many aspects of biology, including stem cell differentiation and development. The same base modification on DNA is the subject of the current studies reported in the three Cell papers. For the Cell study, He s group turned its attention to DNA methylation in green algae. The lead authors of that study were Ye Fu, PhD 12, now a Harvard postdoctoral fellow; and Guan-Zheng Luo, a postdoctoral scholar at UChicago.  What Ye Fu and Guan-Zheng Luo were able to do is to determine very precisely where the methylated bases are in the genome,  Mets explained.  That revealed a whole new set of findings that are also really exciting.  Among these findings, Fu and Luo found a sharply periodic pattern of adenine methylation that corresponds to the main structural feature in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. This structural feature is a protein complex called a nucleosome. Nucleosomes generally can be found anywhere along the length of DNA except in highly expressed genes. In the latter situation, nucleosomes display a precisely spaced pattern. Factors that define the precise positioning of nucleosomes have been mysterious for a long time. The new finding provides a new perspective to answer this question.  We found not only a new DNA modification that affects gene expression, it interestingly marks for active gene expression,  He said. This stands in contrast to the previously known DNA modification, the cytosine methylation that tends to mark for repressive gene expression. Mets said he would like to investigate methylated adenine further to determine its evolutionary origins.  I m interested in exploring how universal this mechanism might be by looking at a wide range of organisms,  Mets said. He, meanwhile, plans further studies of 6mA in the DNA in higher eukaryotes such as mammals.","Published: May 8, 2015"

The systematic sequencing and analysis of tumour samples, as well other oncogenomic experiments, necessitates the tracking of relevant sample information throughout the investigative process. These meta-data of the sequencing and analysis procedures include information about the samples and projects as well as the sequencing centres, platforms, data locations, results locations, alignments, analysis specifications and further information relevant to the experiments. The current work presents a sample tracking system for oncogenomic studies (Onco-STS) to store these data and make them easily accessible to the researchers who work with the samples. The system is a web application, which includes a database and a front-end web page that allows the remote access, submission and updating of the sample data in the database. The web application development programming framework Grails was used for the development and implementation of the system. The resulting Onco-STS solution is efficient, secure and easy to use and is intended to replace the manual data handling of text records. Onco-STS allows simultaneous remote access to the system making collaboration among researchers more effective. The system stores both information on the samples in oncogenomic studies and details of the analyses conducted on the resulting data. Onco-STS is based on open-source software, is easy to develop and can be modified according to a research group s needs. Hence it is suitable for laboratories that do not require a commercial system. The article, Onco-STS: a web-based laboratory information management system for sample and analysis tracking in oncogenomic experiments, is published in PMC and is free to access.","Published: May 8, 2015"

On the whole, the findings suggest that removing bacterial biofilms could be a key strategy for preventing and treating colon cancers, which currently kill about 50,000 Americans per year. The study also revealed an apparent metabolic marker of biofilm-associated colon cancers. Metabolites are small molecules in blood and tissues that are products of the myriad metabolic processes in cells. More than 10,000 distinct metabolites normally can be found in humans. The team began the search with an ""unbiased screen,"" a wide-net technique--using advanced liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry and their XCMS metabolomic cloud-based platform--that registered the levels of thousands of metabolites in a set of colon tissue samples from patients at Johns Hopkins and at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. The data showed that polyamines were important in general and one metabolite--N1, N12-diacetylspermine--was particularly prominent, on average about nine times more abundant in cancerous tissue, compared to nearby non-cancerous tissue. In further tests, the team found that even among cancerous samples, the same metabolite was four times more abundant in the presence of biofilms. In other words, the cancerous cells and the biofilms both seemed to be contributing to its overproduction. Using ""nanostructure imaging mass spectrometry"" (NIMS), the team was able to map the precise locations of N1, N12-diacetylspermine in tissue samples, confirming its higher levels in both tumors and biofilms.  The researchers also carried out a technique called ""global isotope metabolomics,"" using an isotope of N1, N12-diacetylspermine to trace its metabolic fate in cells in an unbiased manner, finding that it appears to be a metabolic end-product. That colon tumors would produce abnormally high amounts of N1, N12-diacetylspermine is not surprising. The molecule belongs to a family of metabolites called polyamines, which are known to have roles in driving cell growth and which are commonly upregulated in cancers as well as in healthy fast-growing tissues. N1, N12-diacetylspermine itself has been observed at higher levels in colon cancer and is considered a potential biomarker for early cancer diagnosis. But why would bacterial biofilms also be linked to higher levels of N1, N12-diacetylspermine? It turns out that bacteria, too, use polyamines to drive their own cells' proliferation and to build biofilms. Polyamines are such ancient, ubiquitous molecules that bacteria apparently can even use those produced by their animal hosts. Thus, biofilms may promote cancer in the colon by inducing chronic inflammation and associated cell proliferation. That increased cell proliferation would be accompanied by a rise in the production of polyamines. Resident bacteria, in turn, could use this abundance of polyamines to make more biofilms--completing the vicious circle. Along the way, levels of the by-product N1, N12-diacetylspermine would be driven higher and higher. Treatment with antibiotics may be an option for removing colonic biofilms and reducing the cancer risks they bring. The scientists found that colon cancer samples from patients who had taken oral antibiotics 24 hours prior to surgery harbored no biofilms and no cultivable bacteria and exhibited significantly less N1, N12-diacetylspermine, on average, than samples from patients who had not taken antibiotics.","Published: May 8, 2015"

Therapeutic hypothermia, or whole body cooling, can improve survival and health outcomes for adults after cardiac arrest and also for newborns with brain injury due to a lack of oxygen at birth. But, until now, this treatment has not been studied in infants or children admitted to hospitals with cardiac arrest. The research findings were presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies Annual Meeting in San Diego and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health. ""Our results show that therapeutic hypothermia is no more effective for treating children after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest than maintaining body temperature within the normal range, "" said co-principal investigator Frank W. Moler, M.D., a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. ""Both treatments help to control fever and result in similar outcomes for patients."" More than 6,000 children suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States each year, according to the American Heart Association's 2015 heart disease and stroke statistics. During cardiac arrest, the heart stops pumping effectively, and blood stops flowing to the brain and other vital organs. In many cases, the outcome is death or long-term disability. The study included 295 participants between 2 days and 18 years old who were admitted to children's hospitals for cardiac arrest, required chest compressions for at least two minutes and remained dependent on mechanical ventilation to breathe. After their parents or guardians provided consent, children were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. One group received body cooling for two days followed by three days of normal temperature control. Another group received normal temperature control for five days. During the treatment, study participants lay between special blankets. Pumps circulate water through tubes in the blankets to maintain specific body temperature ranges: either a lower range of 89.6-93.2 degrees Fahrenheit or a normal range of 96.8-99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. One year after treatment, researchers observed no difference in survival or cognitive function between groups. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in infants and children typically results from causes such as strangulation, drowning, or trauma. A separate study by the same researchers is examining body cooling in hospitalized patients who suffer cardiac arrest, typically as a complication of a medical condition. A goal of both studies is preventing fever, which commonly occurs after cardiac arrest and can lead to more severe outcomes. ""The findings from these studies may well lead to evidence-based guidelines that will improve the quality and rates of pediatric cardiac arrest survival by using better treatments,"" said co-principal investigator J. Michael Dean, M.D., professor of pediatrics and chief of the Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine at the University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City. ""Our hope is to identify the most effective treatment for preventing neurological damage or death in infants and children who suffer cardiac arrest."" The studies are part of the Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest (THAPCA) trials, a six-year effort that is the largest examination of therapeutic hypothermia in children other than newborns for any health condition to date. The trials are funded through NHLBI cooperative agreements U01-HL-094339 and U01-HL-094345. The THAPCA trials are conducted in partnership with the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network, established in 2004 by the NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network, established in 2001 by the Health Resources and Services Administration's Maternal and Child Health Bureau. ""Partnerships with these federally funded pediatric clinical research networks have been essential to the trials,"" said Victoria Pemberton, R.N.C., clinical trials specialist and THAPCA project scientist at NHLBI.

The new resource will enable scientists to examine the underlying genomics of many different human tissues and cells at the same time, and promises to open new avenues to the study and understanding of human biology. GTEx investigators reported initial findings from a two-year pilot study in several papers appearing online May 7, 2015, in Science and other journals. These efforts provide new insights into how genomic variants - inherited spelling differences in the DNA code - control how, when and how much genes are turned on and off in different tissues, and can predispose people to diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes.  GTEx was designed to sample as many tissues as possible from a large number of individuals in order to understand the causal effects of genes and variants, and which tissues contribute to predisposition to disease,  said Emmanouil Dermitzakis, Ph.D., professor of genetics at the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine, Switzerland, and a corresponding author on the main Science paper.  The number of tissues examined in GTEx provides an unprecedented depth of genomic variation. It gives us unique insights into how people differ in gene expression in tissues and organs.  NIH launched the GTEx Project in 2010 to create a data resource and tissue bank for scientists to study how genomic variants may affect gene activity and disease susceptibility. Investigators are collecting more than 30 tissue types from autopsy and organ donations in addition to tissue transplant programs. The DNA and RNA from those samples are then analyzed using cutting-edge genomic methods. The project will eventually include tissue samples from about 900 deceased donors. GTEx is supported by the NIH Common Fund and administered by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), all part of NIH.  GTEx will be a great resource for understanding human biological function, and will have many practical applications in areas such as drug development,  said NHGRI Program Director Simona Volpi, Pharm.D., Ph.D.  Scientists studying asthma or kidney cancer, for example, will be interested in understanding how specific variants influence the biological function of the lung, kidney and other organs.   Projects supported by the Common Fund aim to advance multiple areas of biomedical research,  said James M. Anderson, M.D., Ph.D., director of the NIH Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives, which houses the Common Fund.  The unprecedented breadth of GTEx donors and tissue types establishes a resource that scientists studying areas ranging from blood pressure to neurodegenerative disease would find invaluable.  In the main Science paper, researchers analyzed the gene activity readouts of more than 1,600 tissue samples collected from 175 individuals and 43 different tissues types. One way that researchers evaluate gene activity is to measure RNA, which is the readout from the genome s DNA instructions. Investigators focused much of their analyses on samples from the nine most available tissue types: fat, heart, lung, skeletal muscle, skin, thyroid, blood, and tibial artery and nerve. The genomic blueprint of every cell is the same, but what makes a kidney cell different from a liver cell is the set of genes that are turned on (expressed) and off over time and the level at which those genes are expressed. GTEx investigators used a methodology - expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis - to gauge how variants affect gene expression activity. An eQTL is an association between a variant at a specific genomic location and the level of activity of a gene in a particular tissue. One of the goals of GTEx is to identify eQTLs for all genes and assess whether or not their effects are shared among multiple tissues. Investigators discovered a set of variants with common activity among the different tissue types. In fact, about half of the eQTLs for protein-coding genes were active in all nine tissues. They identified approximately 900 to 2,200 eQTL genes   genes linked to nearby genomic variants - for each of the nine tissues studied, and 6,486 eQTL genes across all the tissues.  We didn t know how specific this regulation would be in different tissues,  said co-corresponding author Kristin Ardlie, Ph.D., who directs the GTEx Laboratory Data Analysis and Coordination Center at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The analysis showed a large number of variants whose effects are common across tissues, and at the same time, there are subsets of variants whose effects are tissue-specific.  Comparing tissue-specific eQTLs with genetic disease associations might help provide insights into which tissues are the most relevant to a disease. The researchers also found a great deal of eQTL sharing among tissues, which can help explain how genomic variants affect the different tissues in which they are active. Even when active in multiple tissues, the same variant can sometimes have a different effect in different tissues. GTEx researchers found, for example, that a variant that affects the activity of two genes associated with blood pressure had a stronger effect on gene expression relevant to blood pressure in the tibial artery - even though there was greater overall gene activity in other tissues. They also noted that the same gene activity profiles characterizing tissues from living donors were seen in the GTEx samples from deceased donors. Two companion studies in Science used GTEx data to examine other aspects of gene activity in different tissues. One study characterized the effects of protein-truncating variants (PTVs) on gene activity. PTVs shorten the protein-coding sequence of genes, and affect their function. Some rare PTVs can lead to diseases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Each person s genome carries about 100 PTVs, though most have little or no effect (and in some cases can even protect against disease). Manuel Rivas, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Oxford, and his colleagues used GTEx data and information from a large European project to examine the gene readouts from more than 600 individuals. The team found PTVs that affect protein production either through the degradation of gene transcripts or by disrupting a process called splicing. In both cases, the researchers were able to use the GTEx data to measure these effects across individuals and tissue types. The group is now developing better methods for predicting the impact of PTVs identified in patients with diseases. In another companion study in Science, Roderic Guigo, Ph.D., coordinator for the Bioinformatics and Genomics Program at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain, and his colleagues examined patterns in gene readouts across nearly 1,500 GTEx tissue samples. The researchers found that gene activity differed substantially more across tissues than across individuals. Investigators discovered just under 2,000 genes that vary with age, including genes related to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson s disease and Alzheimer s disease. They also found more than 750 genes with differences in activity between men and women. Some genes are related to diseases with differences in prevalence between men and women, including five related to heart disease. Three other studies analyzing GTEx data also appear May 8 in the journals Bioinformatics, PLoS Computational Biology and Genome Research.","Published: May 8, 2015"

The transaction brings Lanthio Pharma's lead compound LP2, a novel lanthipeptide in development for diabetic nephropathy and fibrotic diseases to MorphoSys's growing proprietary portfolio. LP2, which will be re-named MOR107, has demonstrated potent angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor-dependent activity in vivo, and is planned to enter clinical trials in 2016. LP2 is the most advanced of four lanthipeptides in Lanthio Pharma's portfolio. In this context, MorphoSys reconfirmed its updated financial guidance issued on March 26, 2015. Prior to the acquisition, MorphoSys held 19.98% of Lanthio Pharma. MorphoSys will pay EUR 20 million to acquire the outstanding share capital of Lanthio Pharma from the other investors, among them INKEF Capital, BioGeneration Ventures and Hanzepoort. As part of its Innovation Capital initiative, MorphoSys had made its initial equity investment in November 2012 as part of Lanthio Pharma's Series A financing round. ""The acquisition of Lanthio Pharma adds a very attractive compound to our growing proprietary portfolio. The lead compound LP2 has the potential to be a first-in-class treatment for various fibrotic diseases and thus represents a commercially attractive opportunity"", commented Dr. Simon Moroney, Chief Executive Officer of MorphoSys.

The project, led by Cornell researchers and funded by a four-year, $5.5 million National Science Foundation (NSF) grant as of May 1, will serve in part as proof of principle that genome editing can be used to address quantitative traits. These are traits, such as height or yield, that are expressed to varying degrees in different individuals. Very little is known about quantitative traits, as they require complex orchestration of many genes. Scientists are also in a race against time to double the production of cereal crops on limited arable land by 2050, when the global population could reach 9.5 billion. The editing technique will focus on such quantitative traits in rice as disease resistance and tolerance to acidic soils. Acidic soils hinder crop growth in 40 percent of the world s arable land, according to Cornell researchers.  We have the ability to open the genome like a book, go to a certain chapter and a specific word and change the word or correct its spelling,  said lead scientist Adam Bogdanove, where words are the DNA sequences that make up genes. Bogdanove, a professor of plant pathology and plant-microbe biology, is principal investigator of the NSF grant and a co-creator of TALENs, a key molecular tool used in genome editing. The researchers already have identified particular stretches of DNA as candidates for the quantitative traits of interest, Bogdanove said. While geneticists have made many advances in DNA sequencing, one grand challenge is defining the specific functions of each DNA sequence. Statistical analyses can determine whether particular stretches of DNA correlate with this or that trait, but the task remains to directly test whether a sequence in fact causes or contributes to a particular trait. That s where genome editing comes in.  We can test the hypothesis that these DNA sequences are important, and use them for crop improvement,  Bogdanove said. Traditional breeding is exceedingly difficult with quantitative traits that are linked to many genes.  Now, we don t have to do years of breeding; we can just make the precise changes needed in a few short steps.  For their work, the researchers will use a newly released dataset for 3,000 rice genomes, and they will test DNA sequences from this set and other rice genomes that are associated with beneficial traits. Rice geneticist Susan McCouch, a co-PI on the project, has been a key contributor to the rice genome dataset. Along with developing a new system that employs genome editing for plant breeding, the researchers also hope to develop new lines of rice that breeders could use to address diseases and acid soils. Additionally, the project team will develop related educational materials for middle and high school students and undergraduates, provide genome editing training workshops for plant biologists, and continually update a public project website, RiceDiversity.org. The researchers are careful to note that genome editing should not be confused with genetic engineering; genome editing entails making precise changes, whereas genetic engineering is  akin to inserting a particular sentence somewhere at random into the book,  Bogdanove said.","Published: May 8, 2015"

At Brandeis University, researchers believe they have discovered an abnormality in the schizophrenic brain that could be responsible for many of the disease s symptoms and could provide a drug target for therapeutic treatments. Led by John Lisman, the Zalman Abraham Kekst Chair in Neuroscience and professor of biology, the research team published their findings in a recent issue of the Journal of Biological Psychiatry. The paper was co-authored by Aranda Duan, Carmen Varela, Yuchun Zhang, Yinghua Shen, Lealia Xiong, and Matthew Wilson. Unusual neural oscillations   brain waves   have long been associated with schizophrenia. The oscillations, delta waves, are similar to slow oscillations seen in normal brains during sleep, but in schizophrenic brains, they occur during wakefulness. The connection between these oscillations and schizophrenic symptoms, particularly cognitive deficits such as memory impairment, has long been unclear. Lisman and his team set out to understand that connection by artificially producing delta waves in mammalian brains using optogenetics, which activates brain signals using light. When the delta frequency light was turned on, Lisman observed disruption in the working memory of rats. When it was turned off, the rodents were once again able to perform working memory tasks. More important, Lisman and his team were able activate the abnormal oscillations only in a tiny subpart of the thalamus, a region of the brain that has long been a focus of schizophrenia research. An information hub and relay center, the thalamus is central to working memory, sleep, consciousness and sensory-information processing.  The oscillations produce an artificial signal that jams normal communication,  Lisman says.  The part of the thalamus that is supposed to carry information about working memory couldn t do the task at all with these sleep-like delta waves. We suspect the abnormal delta oscillations seen in patients with schizophrenia are producing a similar jamming of normal signals.  Delta waves require a specific type of ion channel called a T-type Ca channel. These channels are of particular interest because they are one of the few types of ion channel implicated in schizophrenia by genetic studies. The next step, Lisman says, is to figure out what kind of agents could be used to block these channels.  If you could block these channels, you could block these bad oscillations,  he says.  That may have therapeutic value in patients.  Brandeis University   Original reporting by: Leah Burrows Aranda R. Duan, Carmen Varela, Yuchun Zhang, Yinghua Shen, Lealia Xiong, Matthew A.

No cure exists, and the most effective treatment, keeping blood sugar in control, only slows neuropathy. A new study in the Journal of Neurophysiology, however, introduces a new alternative, omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. The study shows that fish oil supplements can restore the condition of nerves damaged from diabetes in mice. ""Diabetic neuropathy is a very costly and debilitating complication of diabetes. It is the leading cause of foot ulcers and nontrauma-related amputations, and the impact of diabetic neuropathy on the patient and family are unmeasurable,"" said Mark Yorek of the VA Medical Center in Iowa City, the study's lead investigator. Fish oil is an attractive treatment approach because ""supplements are considered very safe and could be easily translated into everyday care. Fish oil would be easy to take, like a vitamin, and should have few side effects when combined with other medications,"" explained Yorek. Previous studies of obesity and diabetes have reported better blood sugar handling, liver function and reduced inflammation with omega-3 fatty acids treatment. The health benefits were attributed to protective molecules produced from omega-3 fatty acids, including one type called resolvins. The research group had previously observed that diets enriched with omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil improved diabetic neuropathy in rats with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, and in this new study they examined why. Researchers used a mouse model of diabetes to study the effect of fish oil. Diabetic mice were fed a high-fat diet and treated with daily injections of resolvin or given a high-fat diet in which half the fat came from fish oil. The results were compared to healthy, non-diabetic mice. The researchers found that untreated diabetic mice had diminished sense of touch in their paws that corresponded to fewer nerves in the paw's skin and slower transmission of signals along the nerves. The eyes of untreated diabetic mice also had fewer nerves. Though dietary fish oil and resolvin did not lower glucose levels closer to healthy range, they improved nerve health in terms of density and sensory signal transmission. The researchers also observed that resolvin stimulated nerve cells to grow.""Even though a lot more work needs to be done, including clinical trials with human subjects, our animal studies suggest that fish oil can reverse some of the harmful effects of diabetes on the nerves. Our intent is to do more animal studies to demonstrate that fish oil treatment can reverse the harmful effects of diabetes on nerves even after a long period of poorly controlled diabetes.

Unfortunately, most are short-term fixes or cause side effects that limit their use. Researchers at the University of Missouri (MU) have discovered a new compound that offers longer lasting painkilling effects, and shows promise as an alternative to current anesthetics. ""Because of its versatility and effectiveness at quickly numbing pain in targeted areas, lidocaine has been the gold standard in local anesthetics for more than 50 years,"" said George Kracke, Ph.D., associate professor of anesthesiology and perioperative medicine at the MU School of Medicine and lead author of the study. ""While lidocaine is effective as a short-term painkiller, its effects wear off quickly. We developed a new compound that can quickly provide longer lasting relief. This type of painkiller could be beneficial in treating sports injuries or in joint replacement procedures."" Painkillers work by interfering with the nervous system's transmission of nerve signals that the body perceives as pain. Lidocaine is used as an injectable pain reliever in minor surgical or dental procedures, or as a topical ointment or spray to relieve itching, burning and pain from shingles, sunburns, jellyfish stings and insect bites. The new compound developed at MU, boronicaine, could potentially serve many of those same functions as an injectable or topical painkiller. National Academy of Sciences member M. Frederick Hawthorne, Ph.D., director of MU's International Institute of Nano and Molecular Medicine and a pioneer in the field of boron chemistry, synthesized boronicaine as a derivative of lidocaine. By changing aspects of the chemical structure of lidocaine, the researchers found that the new compound provided pain relief that lasted five times longer than lidocaine. In pre-clinical, early stage studies, boronicaine provided about 25 minutes of relief, compared to about five minutes of pain relief with lidocaine. ""Although some conditions may warrant the use of a short-lasting painkiller, in many cases a longer lasting anesthetic is a better option,"" Kracke said. ""Having a longer lasting anesthetic reduces the dosage or number of doses needed, limiting the potential for adverse side effects."" While other types of painkillers can provide longer pain relief than lidocaine, they can cause heart toxicity, gastrointestinal issues and other side effects. Preliminary findings show no toxicity in single-dose studies of boronicaine, though more studies are needed. ""Boronicaine could have distinct advantages over existing painkilling medications,"" said Hawthorne, who also serves as the Curators' Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and Radiology at MU. ""We're conducting more research into the side effects of the compound, but in time it could very well become a useful material to use as an anesthetic.""

Brown, Ph.D., chief scientific officer and senior vice president of research at Dicerna, reported on experiments in non-human primates in which subcutaneous administration of DsiRNA-EX Conjugates resulted in potent and durable knockdown of HAO1, a gene implicated in the pathogenesis of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1). An orphan disease, PH1 is a rare, inherited liver disorder that often results in progressive and severe kidney damage.  ""Utilizing our proprietary DsiRNA-EX technology, we have developed DsiRNA-EX Conjugates that facilitated efficient delivery and gene target knockdown in the liver using GalNAc sugars conjugated to the DsiRNA-EX payload achieving an IC50 with a single dose less than 5 mg/kg,"" Dr. Brown explained. ""We are very pleased with these first results showing robust knockdown of HAO1 gene expression in non-human primates, and believe we can potentially generalize this strategy to other liver targets.""  Dicerna has developed investigational DsiRNA-EX Conjugates for liver-related diseases by attaching N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) sugars to one or more points on DsiRNA-EX molecules, yielding multiple proprietary conjugate delivery configurations. The GalNAc sugars specifically bind to receptors on target cells, leading to internalization and access to the RNAi machinery within the cells.  ""Our DsiRNA-EX Conjugate platform may establish a product engine for subcutaneous delivery of gene-targeted molecules,"" commented Douglas Fambrough, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Dicerna. ""This capability allows us to investigate, in parallel, potential therapies for use against a wide variety of liver targets for multiple disease indications.""  At the TIDES conference, Dr. Brown reported potent, durable knockdown of HAO1, along with prolonged liver exposure, in non-human primates following single and multiple subcutaneous doses. He noted that the results in animal models were obtained with multiple independent sequences, suggesting a potentially reproducible and broadly applicable platform.  ""We are optimizing our DsiRNA-EX Conjugates for four therapeutic liver targets, with additional programs planned,"" Dr. Brown said. ""We aim to increase our understanding of the GalNAc conjugate medicinal chemistry through ongoing study of this unique therapeutic approach.""

Previous research has suggested that the flow back fluid from this process can leach out of the soil and into groundwater. Now, researchers have applied a new analytical technique to drinking water and found traces of a chemical compound, 2-BE, as well as an unidentified complex mixture of organic contaminants - both which are seen in flowback water from Marcellus shale activity. ""These findings are important because we show that chemicals traveled from shale gas wells more than two kilometers in the subsurface to drinking water wells,"" co-author Susan Brantley from Penn State said in a statement. ""The chemical that we identified either came from fracking fluids or from drilling additives and it moved with natural gas through natural fractures in the rock. In addition, for the first time, all of the data are released so that anyone can study the problem."" Some scientists say that the chemical composition of flowback fluid weakens the bind between microscopic particles called colloids and the soil. This makes groundwater susceptible to contamination when these particles leach out of the soil, bringing bound pollutants and heavy metals with it. However, this kind of contamination from shale gas wells in shallow potable water sources has never been fully documented before, researchers say. That's because they didn't rely on routine testing, but rather what is referred to as GC-GC-TOFMS - a form of gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The new technique could be a valuable tool in evaluating alleged causes of unconventional gas drilling impacts to groundwater. ""More studies such as ours need to be disseminated to the general public to promote transparency and to help guide environmental policies for improving unconventional gas development,"" said Garth Llewellyn, the study's lead author. The affected homes included in this research are located near a reported well-pad leak at a Marcellus shale site. Scientists believe stray natural gas and wastewater were driven one to three kilometers (0.6 to 1.8 miles) across along shallow to intermediate depth fractures to the source of the homes' well water. Although state environmental regulators previously found high levels of natural gas in the drinking water, they did not discover flowback water contamination above regulatory limits. ""This work demonstrates that these events are possible, but that more sophisticated analytical work may be necessary to uncover the details of the impact,"" added co-author Frank Dorman, associate professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Penn State. However, while some blame fracking, others say leaky gas wells are the root of the groundwater pollution problem. Regardless, more research is needed to better understand how to keep our groundwater clean and prevent further water contamination.","Published: May 7, 2015"

Analysis from Frost & Sullivan, Analysis of the US LIMS Market, finds that the market earned revenues of $218.4 million in 2014 and estimates this to reach $250.7 million in 2018. Providing adaptable systems that can be tailored to a specific industry will help manufacturers widen their consumer base in the U.S. LIMS market. Catering to the fragmented needs of laboratories has led to the deployment of unstandardized products, increasing costs and deterring end users from investing in these solutions.  To boost adoption, vendors need to offer software that is malleable rather than products with a range of capabilities that are redundant to specific needs,  said Frost & Sullivan Healthcare Industry Analyst Aish Vivekanandan.  LIMS vendors must also build systems that can unify laboratories, allow for easy access to data, and enable user-friendly analysis.  To meet these requirements, consumers are beginning to switch to cheaper next-generation cloud-based and thin-client systems. In fact, cloud-native solutions could revolutionize LIMS due to their flexibility in terms of data, functionality and configuration abilities.  The integration of cloud-native models with LIMS will eventually become a norm as laboratories leverage this system to gain remote access to multi-user, multi-device features for a competitive price,  remarked Vivekanandan.  Thus, any vendor distributing proprietary software, where certain processes are restricted, will eventually lose consumers to open-sourced, Web-based and cloud-native suppliers.

The enzyme, called interleukin-2 inducible T-cell kinase, or ITK, has not previously been explored as a driver of solid tumours. Normally, it s expressed in a subset of the body s disease-fighting immune cells. It is hoped the findings could lead to new treatments for melanoma since, as the researchers state, one drug that can block ITK s activity has been approved for blood cancers and others are in the pipeline for other diseases.  We have discovered that ITK is highly expressed in melanoma even though it was thought to be restricted to immune cells, and when you inhibit it, you decrease melanoma growth,  said Nancy E. Thomas, M.D., Ph.D., a UNC Lineberger member, the Irene and Robert Alan Briggaman Distinguished Professor in the UNC School of Medicine Department of Dermatology and the paper s senior author.  Therefore, we think it s a good potential drug target.  There is a need for new treatment targets for melanoma, a deadly disease once it s started to spread. Melanoma of the skin has a 98 percent five-year survival rate when the cancer is localized, according to data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program. But once the cancer has spread regionally, the five-year-survival rate falls to 64 percent. And the survival rate falls to 16 percent after the cancer has spread to more distant regions.  New therapies are needed because of the high mortality rate for metastatic melanoma, and the ability of melanomas to become resistant to many of the current therapies,  said Craig Carson, Ph.D., a research instructor in the UNC School of Medicine Department of Dermatology and the paper s first author. Carson said they hope their recent finding will lead to new treatments for melanoma. In an analysis of normal skin tissue, non-cancerous moles, and melanoma samples, researchers found that ITK was expressed at greater levels in primary and metastatic melanomas than in non-cancerous moles. In the metastatic melanoma samples, 91 percent had higher expression levels than of the non-cancerous moles. The finding was surprising to the researchers because the ITK enzyme is typically expressed only in certain cells in the body.  It s only found in a subset of the immune cells,  Carson said. ITK helps with the development of certain immune cells, the researchers say, and is involved in immune cell activation, development and production.  The cancerous cells were packed with that protein, and it was bizarre   that s not supposed to be there,  Thomas said.  And so, the question is, well, what is it doing there?  They found that the gene s expression in the melanoma cells was a driver of the cancer. When they manipulated cells in the test tube to have lower ITK expression, they found that the cells reproduced more slowly and with less movement. They also found that an experimental inhibitor of the ITK protein s activity had the same effect on cells and slowed tumor growth in mice with melanoma. They hope their findings will lead to development of treatments for melanoma.  ITK has been conceived of as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, but because ITK had not been noted in melanoma before, it has not been a target for its treatment,  Carson said.  I expect ITK to become an important therapeutic target for melanoma because of the expected minimal side effects, and the fact that ITK is found in so many of the melanomas we have investigated.

This evolving technology can now sequentially switch the same neurons - and the behaviors they mediate - on-and-off in mice, say researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health. Such bidirectional control is pivotal for decoding the brain workings of complex behaviors. The findings are the first to be published from the first wave of NIH grants awarded last fall under the BRAIN Initiative.  With its new push-pull control, this tool sharpens the cutting edge of research aimed at improving our understanding of brain circuit disorders, such as schizophrenia and addictive behaviors,  said NIH director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. Bryan Roth, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; Michael Krashes, Ph.D., of NIH s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; and colleagues, debut the second generation of the tool, called DREADD - Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs - on April 30, 2014 in the journal Neuron. DREADD 2.0 improves on a widely-adopted technology developed by Roth, a grantee of NIH s National Institute of Mental Health, and colleagues, over the past decade. It achieves remote control by introducing a synthetic brain chemical messenger system that integrates with the workings of naturally-occurring systems. Researchers genetically-engineer mice to have brains containing what they dub  designer receptors  in specific circuits. These are synthetic proteins on the surface of neurons that can only be activated by a matching synthetic chemical that otherwise has no biological effect   like a lock that can only be opened by a unique key. When the  designer drug  binds to its receptor, depending on its programming, it either triggers or blocks neuronal activity, thus giving researchers experimental control over the animal s brain circuits and behaviors. Early iterations of DREADD could only control activity in one direction - on or off - in the same population of cells. DREADD 2.0 takes advantage of properties offered by a particular type of receptor, paired with a biologically inert chemical that binds to it, to add bidirectional control. Coupled with an existing DREADD, it can be used experimentally to probe circuitry of a broad range of behaviors via sequential, on-and-off control of neurons. It s like having two sets of locks with their own unique keys - one triggering  on,  the other turning  off.  For example, the researchers demonstrated how the improved DREAD toolkit can bi-directionally control animals  movement and feeding behaviors. Since DREADD effects last about an hour - as opposed to milliseconds with an alternative optical-genetic technology - it may be the tool of choice for studies of behaviors requiring prolonged control of circuitry and/or minimal invasiveness.","Published: May 7, 2015"

This is the first reported trajectory of telomere changes over the years in people developing cancer. Scientists have been trying to understand how blood cell telomeres, considered a marker of biological age, are affected in people who are developing cancer. But the results have been inconsistent: some studies find they are shorter, some longer and some show no correlation at all. The Northwestern and Harvard study shows why previous results were confusing. In the new study, scientists took multiple measurements of telomeres over a 13-year period in 792 persons, 135 of whom were eventually diagnosed with different types of cancer, including prostate, skin, lung, leukemia and others. Initially, scientists discovered telomeres aged much faster (indicated by a more rapid loss of length) in individuals who were developing but not yet diagnosed with cancer. Telomeres in persons developing cancer looked as much as 15 years chronologically older than those of people who were not developing the disease. But then scientists found the accelerated aging process stopped three to four years before the cancer diagnosis.    Understanding this pattern of telomere growth may mean it can be a predictive biomarker for cancer,  said Dr. Lifang Hou, the lead study author and a professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.  Because we saw a strong relationship in the pattern across a wide variety of cancers, with the right testing these procedures could be used to eventually diagnose a wide variety of cancers.  The Northwestern and Harvard study is believed to be the first to look at telomere length at more than one time point before diagnosis. That s significant because cancer treatment can shorten telomeres. Post treatment, it s uncertain whether their length has been affected by the cancer or the treatment.  This likely explains why the previous studies have been so inconsistent,  Hou said.  We saw the inflection point at which rapid telomere shortening stabilizes. We found cancer has hijacked the telomere shortening in order to flourish in the body.  Telomeres shorten every time a cell divides. The older you are, the more times each cell in your body has divided and the shorter your telomeres. Because cancer cells divide and grow rapidly, scientists would expect the cell would get so short it would self-destruct. But that s not what happens, scientists discovered. Somehow, cancer finds a way to halt that process. If scientists can identify how cancer hijacks the cell, Hou said, perhaps treatments could be developed to cause cancer cells to self-destruct without harming healthy cells. The research was supported by grants from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences of the National Institutes of Health.","Published: May 7, 2015"

Illumina offers two primary technologies to support the agrigenomics market: next-generation sequencing and genotyping. Each technology addresses the unique needs of the agriculture community, in research and commercial settings. Mike Thompson, PhD, Illumina s Director of Market Development for Agrigenomics, explains how Illumina technologies are used in various agricultural markets. How does genomics increase understanding of genetic diversity in plants and animals? Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can be useful to agricultural researchers who want to understand the complex genomes of crops or livestock, and can be used to develop a reference genome sequence from which to develop future tools for analysis of genetic traits in these plants and animals. Illumina s NGS technology can also be used to sequence the genomes of multiple representatives of a species and discover new genes and variants associated with different traits or characteristics, or for RNA sequencing to study gene expression in these species. Once a sequence or set of relevant characteristics have been identified, Illumina arrays can be used to genotype many organisms of a species to understand the relevant genetic traits associated a particular characteristic. Illumina offers products for many plant and animal species, as well as custom products for any species to meet the needs of researchers and producers. How are Illumina technologies used in relation to crops? In research, NGS has been used extensively in crops to understand genome architecture and expression. Many crop species have large complex genomes that require the power of NGS to decipher. Another application is to improve understanding of viruses infecting crops and help prevent spread of infection. Seed companies and academic institutions alike can use genomic information to accelerate breeding programs by selecting for combinations of genomic markers associated with desirable traits such as drought tolerance, disease resistance, or crop yield. In doing so, seed lines are developed that can improve farming productivity, particularly as climate change threatens more arid regions of the world. Examples of Illumina customers doing this type of work include commercial seed companies, like Syngenta, and academic researchers and field-based teams working on crops not typically farmed industrially in the developed world, such as a group working with cowpea led by UC Riverside researcher Tim Close, PhD. And for livestock? Illumina array technology is now mainstream for commercial breeding in the dairy industry and is also beginning to take hold in many other economically important animal species. Genome-wide arrays are utilized at the birth of an animal to predict the future performance of that animal. The array is a better predictor and much faster than traditional progeny testing. Better performance prediction is enabling better decisions that produce higher profits for breeders and producers. Examples of customers include service providers like Zoetis and GeneSeek and individual ranches like Martin Dairy and Three Trees Ranch. Genetic sequencing can be used not only to understand the characteristics of the livestock or animal, but also the characteristics of viruses that infect it or bacteria that live on or in it. These tools can be helpful for researchers seeking to understand and stop outbreaks of deadly diseases infecting animal populations, such as the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv), because the resolution of NGS enables researchers to pinpoint how viruses mutate over time, helping to understand transmission patterns and develop potential treatments. Similarly, the bacteria colonizing the gut of livestock animals can be sequenced and analyzed to enable wide-ranging research into optimizing animal feed and diagnosing infections, among other applications. How is genomics being leveraged to improve global nutrition? Illumina launched the Agricultural Greater Good Initiative in 2011 as a way to catalyze use of genomics in addressing malnutrition and poverty in the developing world. The award spurs critically needed research aimed at improving sustainability, productivity, and nutritional density in crop and livestock species important in these regions of the world. This year s award recipient, African Orphan Crops Consortium (AOCC), is using Illumina products to sequence the transcriptomes of 50 species of crops commonly grown in backyards and on small plots by populations across Africa, and will be using the information to develop breeding tools aimed at increasing the yields of these crops. Notable past projects have included a program to create breeding tools and training programs for rice growers led by the International Rice Research Institute, and a USDA-led effort leveraging the International Goat Genome Consortium array, which identified traits associated with goat heartiness in dry climates to improve breeding programs in Africa, the Middle East, and India.","Published: May 7, 2015"

Their resistance to cancer has been linked to the production of a substance called high molecular mass hyaluronan (HMM-HA), and mutations in the HAS2 gene that produces it. The researchers from Queen Mary Univ. of London sequenced the HAS2 gene in 13 similar or related mammals, combining the data with DNA sequences extracted from 57 published genomes representing all the major mammal groups. They found that while all African mole rats share some mutations in the HAS2 gene, the naked mole-rat has a unique combination. Dr. Chris Faulkes, lead author of the paper, said:  While naked moles-rats are extreme in many aspects of their biology, we predicted that we would see similar molecular adaptations in the HAS2 gene in other mole-rats and subterranean mammals, yet they remain unique even among other mole-rats within the family.   However, our study has identified a number of other HAS2 gene mutations that are predicted to have a significant effect on hyaluronan production, opening up exciting new avenues of research into the pathways whereby HMM-HA prevents tumor formation.

But the cells have ways to repair the DNA. The cancer drugs aren t as effective as patients need. Researchers at the UNC School of Medicine and UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center have developed a method for finding where this DNA repair happens throughout all of human DNA. The findings, published in the journal Genes & Development, offers scientists a potential way to find and target the proteins cancer cells use to circumnavigate therapy. The benefit of this new method could be more effective and better tolerated classes of cancer therapeutics. The research, led by Aziz Sancar, MD, PhD, the Sarah Graham Kenan Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics, marks the first time scientists have been able to map the repair of DNA damage over the entire human genome.  Now we can say to a fellow scientist,  tell us the gene you re interested in or any spot on the genome, and we ll tell you how it is repaired,  said Sancar, co-senior author and member of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center.  Out of six billion base pairs, pick out a spot and we ll tell you how it is repaired.  When DNA is damaged, cells use many enzymes to cut the strand of DNA and excise the damaged fragment. Then, other enzymes repair the original DNA so that the cells can function properly. Previously, Sancar s lab used purified enzymes to discover how this process happens in DNA damaged by UV irradiation and by chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin and oxaliplatin. In recent years, Michael Kemp, PhD, a researcher on Sancar s team found that a particular protein called TFIIH bound tightly to the excised damaged DNA fragment in the test tube. But for this information to be truly useful to biomedical researchers, the experiment needed to be replicated in human cells. Extracting a stable TFIIH-DNA fragment proved difficult. Not until postdoctoral fellow Jinchuan Hu, PhD, co-first author on the Genes & Development paper, joined Sancar s lab could Sancar s team accomplish the task. Through a series of sophisticated experiments with human skin cells, Hu exposed the cells to ultraviolet radiation and used an antibody against the enzyme TFIIH to isolate the enzyme complex with the excised DNA damage. Then he created experimental techniques to pull the enzyme - as well as the excised DNA fragment it was bound to - from the cells. The fragment was stable enough for Sancar s lab to sequence it. Then, Sheera Adar, PhD, fellow postdoc and paper co-first author, and Jason Lieb, PhD, co-senior investigator of the study, used their expertise in computational biology to analyze where the DNA repair happened throughout the entire genome and thus generate a human genome repair map for the first time. Because UV radiation and common chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin cause DNA damage in similar ways, Sancar s team is now using their new DNA excision repair method - called XR-Seq - to study cells affected by cisplatin. They also hope to use it to study the biochemical reactions in animal models with the goal of finding the specific mechanisms that allow cancer cells to repair DNA damage to survive.  Cisplatin is an old drug,  Adar said.  Right now, it s used with other drugs as a combination therapy. We know these drugs make cancer cells more sensitive to cisplatin. But we don t really know how they do this. We now have an assay to find out how the cells  DNA is being repaired. Our goal is to make cancer cells even more sensitive to existing drugs to help patients.  The research also revealed that parts of the genome scientists previously thought did very little are actually part of this repair process. On chromosomes, DNA forms genes that create proteins - the building blocks of life. Between these genes, there are DNA sequences - simple bits of genetic information.  People have thought that this DNA didn t do anything,  Adar said.  But it turns out that proteins bind to these other DNA sequences, and this affects other nearby or far-away genes. Our analysis shows that these DNA regulatory sequences are also being repaired. So, if they re being repaired, then they re likely important. And now we can find their locations throughout the genome. ","Published: May 7, 2015"

Known as Fusarium head blight, FHB is a fungus that attacks the head of the wheat plant, causing the kernels to shrivel up and produce toxins, leaving the plant discoloured and completely inedible for people and animals.  Fusarium is a huge problem worldwide,  said Dr. Rachid Lahlali, CLS plant innovation research associate.  It can affect up to 50 per cent of crop yields around the world in certain areas. Obviously this is a huge problem.  FHB affects wheat and barley crops in Canada and world-wide. China, parts of southern Africa, Eastern Europe, South America, and the U.S. have all recorded FHB outbreaks in recent years. Lahlali and a research team from the CLS, National Research Council Canada, University of Saskatchewan, and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada used the synchrotron to image both healthy and infected wheat spikes and florets to understand the development and progression of the disease.  What we were trying to do using the synchrotron is to understand how the fungus infects the plant and see what kind of changes are happening,  said Lahlali.  And what we found are biochemical markers at the point of where the infection begins.  Understanding how the fusarium infects the wheat plant will be a huge advantage to plant breeders trying to develop FHB resistant varieties of wheat. Lahlali and his team relied on novel techniques developed at the CLS to image living wheat plants. Typically, plants need to be destroyed or mutilated to conduct proper experiments of this type, but using synchrotron techniques, the group was able to see changes over time. By combining information from two different experiments - phase contrast X-ray imaging and infrared spectroscopy - the group tested the hypothesis that the structural and biochemical differences between resistant and susceptible plants play a significant role in developing resistance to FHB. The results revealed significant differences between infected and non-infected plants, providing valuable information on both the infection and future plant imaging techniques.  We were able to see the differences in the wheat infected by the fungus and our experiments showed us that the structures could be lost or altered, showing us traits that can be changed for the plants to become resistant to FHB.  Lahlali said the next step is to look at other parts of the plant, including the cell wall, to determine structures and immunities that could lead to better varieties.  Our goal is to identify biochemical for Fusarium resistance so plant breeders can use a reliable and fast screening method to develop better FHB-resistant types of wheat. ","Published: May 7, 2015"

The researchers studied mouse models of melanoma, pancreatic, breast and lung cancer and found that their technique could eliminate not only primary tumors, but also distant metastases throughout the body.  The potency is impressive,  said Edgar Engleman, MD, PhD, a professor of pathology and of medicine at Stanford and the senior author of the study.  You actually see tumor eradication.  The procedure described in the paper has not yet been applied to humans, but initial in vitro work with human cancer cells indicates a similar immune-cell response. Unlike many potential treatments that apply to specific cancers, this method could target a wide range of solid tumors, the researchers said. A paper describing the findings were published online April 29 in Nature. The lead author is postdoctoral scholar Yaron Carmi, PhD. The process appears to rely on the same mechanism that causes animals  bodies to reject organ transplants, the researchers said. In both cases, antibodies - molecules that detect foreign substances in the body - kick off the immune response. They bind to proteins from the foreign tissue and, through signaling cells, alert T cells, the immune system s SWAT team. When T cells encounter the  unwelcome  tissue, they attack and destroy it. In the study, the researchers isolated antibodies from mice whose bodies eliminated cancer cells injected into them. When they injected these antibodies, along with chemicals that activated signaling cells called dendritic cells, into cancerous mice, the mice mounted an immune response and remained cancer-free for over a year. An antibody-led cascade Although scientists know that transplanted tumors will almost always be eliminated by the new host s T cells, this rejection doesn t happen right away. Carmi observed no T cell activity for the first week after he injected lab mice with cancer cells from another mouse strain. He did, however, note an increase in the activity of dendritic cells. Dendritic cells are scavenger cells that present foreign proteins, like those made by viruses and some tumors, to the T cells to alert them to the threat. The researchers showed that antibodies were binding to tumor cells, enabling nearby dendritic cells to ingest them. The dendritic cells then displayed proteins from the ingested tumors on their surface to alert T cells. Once primed to recognize the cancerous tissue, the T cells would multiply and not only attack the tumor, but hunt down any metastatic cells traveling through the body. Carmi found that both antibodies and dendritic cells are crucial for tumor elimination.  Within hours after injection, these tumor cells are already coated with antibodies,  said Carmi. If he either disabled the antibodies  ability to bind to tumors or the dendritic cells  ability to ingest the tumors, the T cells failed to clear the cancer.  T cells contain the bullets, but in our system, the antibodies start the whole thing off,  Engleman said. The next step was to see if these antibodies could activate T cells in the original cancer-afflicted mice. The scientists tested two different mouse strains, each susceptible to a different type of cancer. Cancer cells were injected into the mice, and tumors appeared in them within two weeks. Carmi surgically removed growing tumors from the mice, mixed them in blood plasma from a cancer-free mouse of a different genetic strain, and collected the antibodies that stuck to the tumors. He then added the antibodies, with or without dendritic cells, back into the mice. The residual cancer cells left behind after surgery regrew the tumors within days in all the animals, but those that had received the antibodies and dendritic cells rejected the tumors, which shrank away over the course of several days. The mice had no recurrence of cancer for more than a year. However, those injected with just the antibodies, not the dendritic cells, failed to mount a T cell response, and they died of the cancer within two weeks.  We were very frustrated at first when the antibodies alone didn t work,  said Engleman. In retrospect, he said, it shouldn t have been a surprise. He explained that tumors not only evade the immune system, they suppress it, rendering dendritic cells within the tumor inoperable. To reactivate the dendritic cells, Carmi spent over a year trying various factors, eventually hitting upon a combination of the growth factor TNF-alpha and the CD40 binding protein. Adding these dendritic-stimulating factors to the antibodies successfully eliminated six different cancer-forming cell lines - two melanomas, one of which was genetically engineered; lymphoma; breast cancer; lung cancer; and pancreatic cancer - from four strains of mice.  Yaron was able to show that this combination therapy was extraordinarily powerful,  said Engleman.  Pretty much we could eliminate any cancer.  To confirm that a similar mechanism was present in humans, blood plasma from 10 healthy donors was pooled to collect antibodies against four cancers from patients: two lung and two mesothelioma cancers. The antibodies with the stimulation factors were able to activate the two lung cancer patients  dendritic cells in vitro. With the cells from the two mesothelioma cancer patients, the antibodies induced T cell proliferation in vitro under the same experimental conditions.  Tour de force  Medical oncologist Holbrook Kohrt, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford who was not involved with the study, called the paper  a nice tour de force  and believes the novel therapeutic strategy could utilize the patient s own immune system to defend against certain cancers. Kohrt oversees numerous clinical trials involving immunotherapy for cancer patients and thinks an important aspect of the technique is its potential to fight different tumor types. Given that TNF-alpha and CD40 have been used in other clinical trials, Kohrt predicted that developing them into a therapeutic drug would be fairly straightforward.  I honestly think the most important thing is to see if we can bring this new approach into the clinic,  said Engleman.  That s where we want to go. ","Published: May 7, 2015"

Now, scientists at the Salk Institute have uncovered details about stem cell growth that could help improve regenerative therapies. While it was known that two key cellular processes-called Wnt and Activin-were needed for stem cells to grow into specific mature cells, no one knew exactly how these pathways worked together. The details of how Wnt and Activin influence each other, published April 30, 2015 in Molecular Cell, offer guidance for improving stem cell therapies. The new work also reveals more about certain cancers that arise when these processes go astray, for example, when the Wnt signaling step becomes inappropriately reactivated, as happens in most colon cancers.  We found that the mechanisms of these two pathways are complementary and activate the transcription, or turning on, of about 200 genes essential for stem cells to differentiate,  says Kathy Jones, senior author of the paper and a Salk professor. These genes are among the first steps that prompt stem cells to begin to change, or differentiate, into specific tissues, particularly ones that will eventually form the digestive and respiratory tracts, including intestines, lung, pancreas, thyroid and liver. The researchers found that Wnt loads up the cellular machinery needed to begin the copying and activation of genes. Activin, meanwhile, boosts the process further: it increases the speed and efficiency by which the cellular machinery moves to copy the gene. Whereas Wnt treatment alone enhances the expression of developmental genes by a factor of 20-fold, further treatment with Activin boosts the signal to 150-fold or higher, says Jones. The team also found that the order of the signaling is equally important, because Activin could not turn on these genes unless the cells were first exposed to the Wnt signal.  Wnt gets the ball rolling and Activin amplifies the signal,  says Conchi Estar s, first author of the paper.  This is a particularly clear example of how two different pathways, working through two different mechanisms, can cooperate to activate the same genes.  The new finding adds to a growing picture that the transcription process is much more dynamic than previous thought.  Now we understand stem cell differentiation at a much finer level by seeing how these cellular signals transmit their effects in the cells,  adds Jones.  Understanding these details is important for developing more robust stem cell protocols and optimizing the efficiency of stem cell therapies.  When they looked closer at the genes that both pathways activated, researchers were surprised to find that the pathways were further connected to a third process, which is known to control tissue growth and organ size. The central protein in this new pathway, called Yap, acted specifically at these genes to counteract the effects of the Activin.  The opposing effects of Activin and Yap are exerted at a late step in transcription, the elongation phase,  says Jones.  We don t know very much about the signaling networks in normal or cancer cells specifically affect the elongation stage of transcription, so it was a real bonus to find that it is targeted by two pathways in stem cells.  Both the Wnt and Activin signaling processes operate differently in cancer, compared to stem cells. Wnt, in particular, is turned on very early in human colon cancer in nearly 90 percent of cases. The aberrant behavior of the Activin process, meanwhile, is tied to the metastasis of many cancers.  There is great interest in developing transcription-based inhibitors of the Wnt pathway, because these would have strong anticancer activity for many tumor types,  says Estar s.

In Arabidopsis, CONSTANS (CO) and FLAVIN-BINDING KELCH REPEAT F-BOX1 (FKF1) promote flowering by inducing FLOWER LOCUS T (FT) expression in the long-day afternoon. The CO protein is present in the morning but could not activate FT expression due to unknown negative mechanisms, which prevent premature flowering before the day length reaches a threshold. Here, we report that TARGET OF EAT1 (TOE1) and related proteins interact with the activation domain of CO and CO-like (COL) proteins and inhibit CO activity. TOE1 binds to the FT promoter near the CO-binding site, and reducing TOE function results in a morning peak of the FT mRNA. In addition, TOE1 interacts with the LOV domain of FKF1 and likely interferes with the FKF1-CO interaction, resulting in partial degradation of the CO protein in the afternoon to prevent premature flowering.

Researchers at Brigham Young University (BYU) have shed new light on why you, your friends, neighbors and most everyone you know tend to snack at night: some areas of the brain don t get the same  food high  in the evening. In a newly published study, exercise sciences professors and a neuroscientist at BYU used MRI to measure how people s brains respond to high- and low-calorie food images at different times of the day. The results showed that images of food, especially high-calorie food, can generate spikes in brain activity, but those neural responses are lower in the evening.  You might over-consume at night because food is not as rewarding, at least visually at that time of day,  said lead author Travis Masterson.  It may not be as satisfying to eat at night so you eat more to try to get satisfied.  The study, which appears in academic journal Brain Imaging and Behavior, also reports that participants were subjectively more preoccupied with food at night even though their hunger and  fullness  levels were similar to other times of the day. Masterson, who carried out the research for his master s thesis under faculty advisor James LeCheminant, said the intent was to better understand if time of day influences neural responses to pictures of food. The researchers teamed up with BYU neuroscientist Brock Kirwan to use functional MRI to monitor the brain activity of study subjects while they viewed images of food. The participants viewed 360 images during two separate sessions held one week apart one during morning hours and one during evening hours. Subjects looked at images of both low-calorie foods (vegetables, fruits, fish, grains) and high-calorie foods (candy, baked goods, ice cream, fast food). As expected, the researchers found greater neural responses to images of high-calorie foods. However, they were surprised to see lower reward-related brain reactivity to the food images in the evening.  We thought the responses would be greater at night because we tend to over-consume later in the day,  said study co-author Lance Davidson, a professor of exercise sciences.  But just to know that the brain responds differently at different times of day could have implications for eating.  Nevertheless, researchers noted that the study is preliminary and additional work is needed to verify and better understand the findings. The next research steps would be to determine the extent that these neural responses translate into eating behavior and the implications for weight management.   Masterson, who is heading to Penn State University to work on his Ph.D. in the fall, said the study has helped him pay better attention to how food makes him feel both in the morning and the evening. And as for his late-night eating habits?  I tell myself, this isn t probably as satisfying as it should be,  he said.  It helps me avoid snacking too much at night.

Yet 60% of American adults are clinically overweight or obese and more than 16% of deaths nationwide are related to diet and physical activity.  There is clearly a disconnect if we have a majority of the population that has tried to lose weight and a majority of the population that is overweight,  says Marc Kiviniemi, a public health researcher at the University at Buffalo (UB).  People are planning to diet and trying to diet, but that s not translating into a successful weight loss effort.  Many issues, from biological to environmental, determine effective weight control, but how people manage their own behavior is a big piece of that puzzle. Dieting is a process that involves a plan to change eating behavior and behaving according to that plan. But the factors that guide diet planning differ from those that guide actual diet behavior, according to the results of Kiviniemi s new study with Carolyn Brown-Kramer of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln published in the Journal of Health Psychology.  The crux of the disconnect is the divide between thoughts and feelings. Planning is important, but feelings matter, and focusing on feelings and understanding their role can be a great benefit,  says Kiviniemi, associate professor of community health and health behavior in the UB School of Public Health and Health Professions. Plans to change behavior are a function of thoughts, the belief that weight loss is possible by making better food choices. But when it comes to making a food choice and deciding to execute the plan, feelings guide behavior.  If you re sitting back conceiving a plan you may think rationally about the benefits of eating healthier foods, but when you re in the moment, making a decision, engaging in a behavior, it s the feelings associated with that behavior that may lead you to make different decisions from those you planned to make.  The findings highlight the shortcomings of deprivation diets or diets based on food choices that ignore people s preferences.  First of all, the deprivation experience is miserable. If you didn t associate negative feelings with it to start, you will after a few days,  says Kiviniemi.  The other thing that s important is the distinction between things that require effort and things that are automatic.  Planning is an effort that demands mental energy, but feelings happen automatically. Deprivation or anything that demands a high degree of self-control is a cognitive process. If you put yourself in a position to use that energy every time you make a food choice that energy is only going to last so long.  Kiviniemi says dieters should seriously consider enjoyment when framing and shaping a behavior change.  In the dietary domain, eating more fruits and vegetables is fabulous advice. But if you have negative feelings about those food choices, they might not represent elements of a good plan,  says Kiviniemi.  It s not just about eating healthy foods. It s about eating the healthy foods you like the most.  It s not easy, and a lot of work is required to move intention to action, which is why Kiviniemi says planning should be broadly based on both thoughts and feelings.  Think seriously about how you re going to implement the plans you make to change your behavior, and that includes not only the feeling component, but how you plan to overcome a negative reaction that might surface during a diet.  It s not just the knowledge of what we re eating, but consideration of how we ll feel having decided to eat those foods, he says. University at Buffalo   Original reporting by:Bert Gambini Marc T.

Published in the journal Behavioural Brain Research, the study adds to the increasing amount of literature showing that transcranial direct current stimulation   tDCS   has mixed results when it comes to cognitive enhancement.  It would be wonderful if we could use tDCS to enhance cognition because then we could potentially use it to treat cognitive impairment in psychiatric illnesses,  said Flavio Frohlich, PhD, study senior author and assistant professor of psychiatry, cell biology and physiology, biomedical engineering, and neurology.  So, this study is bad news. Yet, the finding makes sense. It means that some of the most sophisticated things the brain can do, in terms of cognition, can t necessarily be altered with just a constant electric current.  Frohlich, though, said that using less common alternating current stimulation   so-called tACS   could be a better approach, one that he has been investigating. Earlier this year, Frohlich s lab found that tACS significantly boosted creativity, likely because he used it to target the brain s natural electrical alpha oscillations, which have been implicated in creative thought. With tDCS, scientists don t target these brain waves, which represent neuronal patterns of communication throughout regions of the brain. Instead, they use tDCS to target brain structures, such particular regions of the cortex. The tDCS boom started in 2000, when German scientists published a paper showing that tDCS could change the excitability of neurons in the motor cortex   the brain region that controls voluntary body movement. Since then, there s been an explosion of tDCS studies to try to make neurons more active or less active and therefore change outcomes for a variety of brain functions, such as working memory and cognitive acuity, and for illnesses, such as depression and schizophrenia. But Frohlich said that some of the studies that have made waves were poorly designed. Some studies were not properly double-blinded or properly placebo controlled.  Other studies were very small   less than 10 people. A recent meta-analysis of a large number of tDCS papers showed that tDCS is far from a magic pill for cognitive enhancement or brain-related health conditions.  Aside from stimulating the motor cortex, which has very exciting implications for stroke rehabilitation, I think the jury is still out on tDCS,  said Frohlich, who is a member of the UNC Neuroscience Center. In the Behavioural Brain Research study, Frohlich s team   including graduate student Kristin Sellers, the paper s first author   recruited 40 healthy adults, each of whom took the standard WAIS-IV intelligence test, which is the most common and well-validated test of IQ. It includes tests for verbal comprehension, perceptional reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. A week later, Frohlich s team divided the participants into two groups. Electrodes were placed on each side of each participant s scalp, under which sat the frontal cortex. Duke University collaborator and co-author Angel Peterchev, PhD, created imaging simulations to ensure Frohlich s team targeted the same parts of the cortex that previous tDCS studies had targeted. Then the placebo group received sham stimulation   a brief electrical current, which led participants to think they had been receiving the full tDCS. The other participants received the standard tDCS for twenty minutes   a weak electrical current of 2 millioamperes. All participants then retook the IQ tests. Frohlich expected that most, if not all, IQ scores would improve because of the practice effect, but that tDCS would not markedly improve scores. Frohlich s team did find that all scores improved. Surprisingly, though, the participants who did not receive tDCS saw their IQ scores increase by ten points, whereas participants who received tDCS saw their IQ scores increase by just shy of six points, on average. When Frohlich and colleagues analyzed the test scores, they saw that the scores for three of the four main kinds of cognitive tests were very similar between the two groups of participants. But the scores for perceptual reasoning were much lower among people who underwent tDCS. Perceptual reasoning tests fluid intelligence, which is defined as the ability to think logically and apply innovative problem solving to new problems. Within the category of perceptual reasoning, the researchers saw the biggest differences in the subcategory of matrix reasoning   when participants viewed two groups of symbols and had to find the one symbol missing from the other group. Frohlich emphasized,  Our findings do not preclude the possibility that other tDCS paradigms may be less harmful or even beneficial. However, it is time to make sure that everybody uses gold standard, placebo-controlled, double-blind study designs. Also, our study demonstrates the importance of more research on how stimulation interacts with brain activity.  Frohlich stressed that the scientific community should be careful not to create simplistic storylines about tDCS being a  magic pill  for many brain-related conditions.  There could be dangerous consequences, especially if tDCS is used daily,  he said.  Ours was an acute study. We don t know what the long-term effects are. There is so much more we need to understand before tDCS is ready for home use without medical supervision.  Frohlich added,  I think our study demonstrates that we need to think of smarter ways to engage the brain to really target the specific brain dynamics involved in what we want to improve, such as cognition for people with depression or schizophrenia. I think tACS is an option, as well as more sophisticated modalities we ve yet to develop.  University of Carolina Health Care   press release Kristin K. Sellers, Juliann M. Mellin, Caroline M.

It also matters in which form the cannabis is consumed -- for example, as a joint, bong, or hash cake. Cannabis is the most popular illegal drug in Germany and was consumed by almost one in 20 adults in Germany last year. An estimated one in 10 consumers will become dependent. This is critical especially for adolescents, because they are more prone to becoming dependent than adults. Addiction treatment is mostly provided on an outpatient basis. Currently, combination therapy -- consisting of motivational support, cognitive behavioral therapy, and contingency management (learning via systematic rewards) -- is the most promising approach, as the authors emphasize.

The amount of pigmentation on the abdomen of Drosophila melanogaster is a relatively simple morphological trait, which serves as a model for mapping the genetic basis of variation in complex phenotypes. Here, we assessed natural variation in female abdominal pigmentation in 175 sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel, derived from the Raleigh, NC population. We quantified the proportion of melanization on the two most posterior abdominal segments, tergites 5 and 6 (T5, T6). We found significant genetic variation in the proportion of melanization and high broad-sense heritabilities for each tergite. Genome-wide association studies identified over 150 DNA variants associated with the proportion of melanization on T5 (84), T6 (34), and the difference between T5 and T6 (35). Several of the top variants associated with variation in pigmentation are in tan, ebony, and bric-a-brac1, genes known to affect D. melanogaster abdominal pigmentation. Mutational analyses and targeted RNAi-knockdown showed that 17 out of 28 (61%) novel candidate genes implicated by the genome-wide association study affected abdominal pigmentation. Several of these genes are involved in developmental and regulatory pathways, chitin production, cuticle structure, and vesicle formation and transport. These findings show that genetic variation may affect multiple steps in pathways involved in tergite development and melanization. Variation in these novel candidates may serve as targets for adaptive evolution and sexual selection in D.melanogaster.

For aflatoxin biosynthesis to be completed, the required enzymes must be transported to specialized early and late endosomes called aflatoxisomes. Of particular significance, seven aflatoxin biosynthetic enzymes are P450/monooxygenases which catalyze reactions that can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) as byproducts. Thus, oxidative reactions in the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway could potentially be an additional source of intracellular ROS.  The present work explores the hypothesis that the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway generates ROS (designated as  secondary  ROS) in endosomes and that secondary ROS possess a signaling function. We used specific dyes that stain ROS in live cells and demonstrated that intracellular ROS levels correlate with the levels of aflatoxin synthesized. Moreover, feeding protoplasts with precursors of aflatoxin resulted in the increase in ROS generation. These data support the hypothesis.

More than 25,000 cases and 10,000 deaths have been reported. It has caused more fatalities than all previous outbreaks combined. Symptoms of Ebola usually appear 2 to 21 days after exposure. Infection can cause fever, headache, body aches, weakness, stomach pain, and lack of appetite. Later symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, and in some cases internal and external bleeding. Clinical trials have recently begun in West Africa to evaluate the effectiveness of several vaccines to prevent the disease. Researchers are also testing agents to treat Ebola-including ZMapp, which is composed of monoclonal antibodies. Currently, there are no approved drugs to treat or manage infections. A team led by Dr. Thomas Geisbert at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston, in collaboration with Tekmira Pharmaceuticals in Vancouver, Canada, have been developing therapies that can target specific strains of the Ebola virus. The strategy uses molecules called small interfering RNA (siRNA). These are short pieces of RNA designed and built with specific sequences that  interfere  with production of key proteins crucial for survival of the virus without interfering with any processes in uninfected cells. An important advantage of siRNAs is that their sequences can be rapidly redesigned to target various strains of the Ebola virus. The Tekmira team developed a new siRNA treatment, called siEbola-3, against the Makona outbreak strain of Ebola. Directly administering siRNAs can cause harmful immune responses. Thus the team encapsulated the siRNAs in lipid nanoparticles for safer delivery. The UTMB scientists tested the lipid nanoparticle siRNA treatment in monkeys that had been exposed to the Makona strain. The work was funded by NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Results appeared online on April 22, 2015, in Nature. Animals treated 3 days after virus exposure-at which point they showed evidence of advanced disease-developed only mild symptoms and fully recovered. The animals showed less liver and kidney damage than normally occurs during an Ebola infection. Untreated animals succumbed to the disease in a time course similar to what has been reported in patients who begin showing symptoms of Ebola.  The candidate treatment was rapidly adapted to target the Makona outbreak strain of Ebola virus,  Geisbert says.  We were able to protect all of our nonhuman primates against a lethal Makona Ebola infection when treatment began 3 days following infection.  The siEbola-3 agent is currently being administered to Ebola-infected patients in Sierra Leone in a phase 2 study. The researchers note that use of a blend of several different siRNAs could potentially be used to combat newly emerging viral strains.","Published: May 6, 2015"

Now, researchers have uncovered a new purpose for one such histone variant: preventing genetic mutations by keeping certain so-called  jumping genes  in place. This research, which began at Rockefeller University and was published May 4 in Nature, reveals a basic mechanism by which epigenetics, or the control of inherited traits through means other than DNA, works. Due to histones  close relationship with DNA, scientists have known for some time that they are frequently involved in epigenetic control of genes. In this case, one particular histone variant appears to reduce the chance of potentially harmful changes in the stem cells that will eventually generate the various types of tissue that make up a living creature.  They say that good things come in small packages. Nowhere is this more true than with histone variants. This study found the variant H3.3, which differs only slightly from the standard H3 histones, helps prevent certain genetic elements, which are remnants left behind by ancient viral infections, from moving about within the genome,  says study author C. David Allis, Joy and Jack Fishman Professor and head of the Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Epigenetics.  This discovery is an important addition to our still-evolving knowledge of how epigenetics works at the molecular level.  Histones are proteins that act as spools for the thread that is DNA, giving it support and structure. Chemical modifications to these histones can change the expression of genes, making them more available for expression or silencing them by compacting the DNA-protein complex. Oddball H3.3 varies from its regular counterpart H3 by only few amino acids. Because it is present throughout the animal kingdom, however, scientists have suspected for some time that H3.3 has a specific biological role. Study authors Simon Els sser and Laura Banaszynski, both of whom worked on H3.3 in Allis s lab at Rockefeller but have since moved on to other institutions, started by looking at the locations on the mouse genome where H3.3 was deposited in stem cells. Els sser began the project as graduate student in Allis s lab and continued as a postdoc at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in the United Kingdom. He is now an assistant professor at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. He had the idea to look for H3.3 at repetitive sequences; however, repeats are normally filtered out in a genome-wide study. So, Elsasser developed a new approach to capture this information. A pattern emerged from the results: H3.3 appeared at a certain type of repetitive sequence: retrotransposons, which are leftovers from ancient viral infections. Unlike their ancestral viruses, retrotransposons are trapped in the host genome, but they can still copy themselves and jump to new locations within it. Sometimes, evolution finds a use for them. For instance, retrotransposon-derived genes code for proteins necessary for the placenta in mammals. But when retrotransposons jump, they can also cause harmful mutations. For studies like this one, which explores chromatin s role regulating gene expression, scientists often use mouse embryonic stem cells. Stem cells  chromatin landscape is more plastic than that of differentiated cells, reflecting their capacity to enter any of many gene expression programs that lead to the hundreds of different cell types in an adult organism. Once the cells have begun to pick an identity, parts of the genome not needed for that identity get closed off forever. Prior to the current study, scientists knew mouse stem cells kept most of the genome accessible, while keeping the lid on retrotransposons by tagging them with chemical markers containing three methyl groups on histone H3. Early experiments done by Banaszynski, while a postdoc in Allis s lab, suggested that H3.3 is necessary for the placement of these suppressive  trimethyl  marks.  By taking away proteins responsible for placing H3.3 into chromatin, or eliminating H3.3 completely, we confirmed that trimethylation depends on H3.3,  says Banaszynski, who is currently an assistant professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.  Furthermore, retrotransposons became more active in cells without H3.3, and in these cells, we saw chromosomal abnormalities. It may be that by silencing retrotransposons, H3.3 prevents these abnormalities, however we cannot eliminate the possibility that loss of H3.3 results in this genomic instability for other reasons,  Els sser says. Although the types of retrotransposons studied in these experiments are not active in humans, it s likely that human stem cells do use H3.3 to keep other varieties of jumping genes in place, Banaszynski says. The research has implications beyond epigenetics.  This study also hints at a fascinating question in biology: How do cells balance the potential evolutionary benefit of mobile elements, such as retrotransposons, with the competing need to silence them so as to maintain the genome?  she says.","Published: May 6, 2015"

This multimodal imaging will allow scientists to explore thin films of phase-separated polymers important for energy conversion and storage. Their results are published in ACS Nano, a journal of the American Chemical Society.  Combining the two capabilities marries the best of both worlds,  said project leader Olga Ovchinnikova, who co-led the study with Gary Van Berkel, head of ORNL s Organic and Biological Mass Spectrometry Group.  For the same location, you get not only precise location and physical characterization, but also precise chemical information.  Added Van Berkel,  This is the first time that we ve shown that you can use multiple methods through the atomic force microscope. We demonstrated for the first time that you could collect diverse data sets together without changing probes and without changing the sample.  The new technique for functional imaging allows probing of regions on the order of billionths of meters, or nanometers, to characterize a sample s surface hills and valleys, its elasticity (or  bounciness ) throughout deeper layers, and its chemical composition. Previously, AFM tips could penetrate only 20 nanometers to explore a substance s ability to expand and contract. Adding a thermal desorption probe to the mix allowed scientists to probe deeper, as the technique cooks matter off the surface and removes it as deep down as 140 nanometers. The MS s precise chemical analysis of compounds gave the new technique unprecedented ability to characterize samples.  We re now able to see subsurface structure that we were blind to before, using standard techniques,  Ovchinnikova said. In the past, scientists measured physical and chemical properties on different instruments that displayed data on different resolution scales. The width of a pixel of AFM data might be 10 nanometers, whereas the width of a pixel of MS data might be 10 microns-a thousand times larger.  The resolution of the chemical identification was much poorer,  Ovchinnikova emphasized.  You would take images from different techniques and try to line them up and create a melded image. Because the pixel sizes would be so different, alignment would be difficult.  The ORNL innovation fixed that problem.  Because we are now using one setup, the pixel sizes are very similar to each other. You can pinpoint one pixel and correlate it to another pixel in the image,  Ovchinnikova said. Now scientists can perfectly overlay data, much like digital cameras faultlessly stitch together smaller pictures to create a panoramic image. Aligned analytics It took a team to characterize the topographies, nanomechanics and chemistry of phase-separated domains and the interfaces between them. The scientists tested their combined AFM/MS platform by probing a phase-separated polymer thin film. Vera Bocharova, of the Soft Materials Group, made a 500-nanometer-thick film with polymers that separated into islands of poly-2-vinylpyridine in a sea of polystyrene. Vilmos Kertesz developed software to link analysis capabilities, and Van Berkel, Ovchinnikova and Tamin Tai set up the experiment and took and processed data. Mahmut Okatan, Alex Belianinov and Stephen Jesse of the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences set up equipment to probe atom-scale mechanical properties. Anasys Instruments, a developer of thermal probes, loaned the researchers a modified AFM instrument for the experiment. The company owns probe-tip intellectual property and licensed ORNL technology that uses heated AFM probes to remove matter from the surface and subsequently transport and ionize it for mass spectrometric analysis. Anasys recently received a phase-2 Small Business Innovation Research grant from DOE to couple atomic force microscopy and mass spectrometry in a commercial product. Such a device would bring multimodal imaging out of the rarified realm of national labs and into the larger scientific community. Ovchinnikova envisions companies using the technology to answer fundamental questions about product performance. If a polymer blend-in a rubber tire or plastic bottle-is failing, why is it failing? In a stressed area, how are nanomechanical properties changing? What is the exact chemical composition at points of failure?  This is something that AFM by itself could never see. It could just see differences in mechanics, but it could never really tell you precise chemistry in a location,  said Ovchinnikova. The ORNL researchers are eager to explore scientific challenges that could not be addressed before the advent of high-resolution chemical mapping. For example, a better understanding of the structure and properties of solar-energy materials may speed improvements in their efficiency. Next, to make multimodal imaging even more powerful, the researchers are considering coupling thermal desorption mass spectrometry-a destructive technique that cooks matter off a surface to enable its chemical analysis-with optical spectroscopy, a nondestructive technique.

This new class of DPCs may also enable targeting of RNAi therapeutics to tissues outside of the liver. The manuscript entitled,  Protease-triggered siRNA delivery vehicles,  by David B. Rozema et al, was made available online ahead of print in the Journal of Controlled Release 209 (2015) 57-66. In the publication, Arrowhead scientists describe the development of protease-sensitive masking chemistries that are used in a class DPCs where the RNAi trigger molecule is conjugated directly to the polymer delivery vehicle. These new vehicles expand on the company s existing acid labile DPCs, where the polymer and RNAi trigger are two separate molecules and are co-injected. The protease-sensitive linkages appear to be more stable and have longer circulation times, which may allow for an increased range of targeting, and appear amenable to subcutaneous administration. The publication reports a high level of target gene knockdown and long duration of effect can be achieved after subcutaneous injection with these new DPC delivery vehicles in nonhuman primates. After a single subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mg/kg siRNA against Factor 7 (FVII), a liver expressed coagulation factor that is secreted into the bloodstream, a 99% reduction of FVII activity was observed in nonhuman primates. Further, this reduction was highly durable with maximal knockdown occurring 24 days after injection and measurable reduction in FVII activity appears to persist for up to 200 days. ""This publication speaks to the flexibility of the DPCs and the ability of our scientists to continually expand the platform to enable additional uses,  said Christopher Anzalone, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer.  These data suggest that subcutaneously administered DPCs that employ the protease sensitive masking chemistries may be well suited to address chronic diseases of the liver that require long-term treatment and where long dosing intervals would be very attractive to physicians and patients.

The grant from NIH's High End Instrumentation program funds the acquisition of a new Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer for the UC Santa Cruz NMR Facility. With much higher magnetic field and sensitivity than the facility's other spectrometers, the new instrument is crucial for the elucidation of the structures of complex biomolecules, said Ilan Benjamin, professor and chair of chemistry and biochemistry. Six UC Santa Cruz faculty scientists make extensive use of NMR spectroscopy in their NIH-funded research projects. Work in these labs addresses issues related to cancer biology, neurodegenerative diseases, drug development, infectious diseases, and the molecular machinery of circadian rhythms. Strong user base ""We have a remarkably strong user base, and I think part of the appeal of our proposal was the wide range of important, health-related applications that critically depend on high-end NMR spectroscopy,"" said Glenn Millhauser, distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry and principal investigator for the proposal. In addition, the NMR Facility recently hired a new manager, Jack Lee, Ph.D., through a national search, providing excellent support for the new instrument. Millhauser said the NIH High End Instrumentation grants are offered nationwide every other year and are very competitive. ""I'm beyond thrilled,"" he said. ""This grant speaks to the visibility and importance of the research in NMR structural biology at UC Santa Cruz."" Based on the same principles as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique for analyzing molecular structures and identifying chemical compounds. The UC Santa Cruz NMR facility currently houses two older instruments and one modern 600 MHz NMR spectrometer that now runs at near full capacity. The NIH grant allows the purchase of a new, more powerful 800 MHz NMR spectrometer that will complement the existing instruments. ""Really high-end instruments like this are rare and often limited to regional facilities, and in the past we have had to travel to other institutions to use them,"" Millhauser said. ""That's a serious problem if you have samples that aren't stable, or if you want to make adjustments to your samples and examine the responses. There are a lot of things you can't do if you have to travel to a regional facility, so this new spectrometer will greatly accelerate our research."" In addition to the $2 million NIH grant, significant contributions to cover the total cost of the spectrometer (about $2.5 million) were provided by the Office of Research, Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.","Published: May 6, 2015"

This is the first evidence that genetically ties all of the I upiat and Inuit populations from Alaska, Canada and Greenland back to the Alaskan North Slope,  said Northwestern s M. Geoffrey Hayes, senior author of the new study published April 29, 2015 in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology. In this study, all mitochondrial DNA haplogroups previously found in the ancient remains of Neo- and Paleo-Eskimos and living Inuit peoples from across the North American Arctic were found within the people living in North Slope villages. These findings support the archaeological model that the  peopling of the eastern Arctic  began in the North Slope, in an eastward migration from Alaska to Greenland. It also provides new evidence to support the hypothesis that there were two major migrations to the east from the North Slope at two different times in history.  There has never been a clear biological link found in the DNA of the Paleo-Eskimos, the first people to spread from Alaska into the eastern North American arctic, and the DNA of Neo-Eskimos, a more technologically sophisticated group that later spread very quickly from Alaska and the Bering Strait region to Greenland and seemed to replace the Paleo-Eskimo,  Hayes said.  Our study suggests that the Alaskan North Slope serves as the homeland for both of those groups, during two different migrations. We found DNA haplogroups of both ancient Paleo-Eskimos and Neo-Eskimos in I upiat people living in the North Slope today.  Hayes is an assistant professor of endocrinology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and an assistant professor of anthropology at Northwestern s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. He has been studying population genetics of the Arctic for more than a decade. At the request of I upiat elders from Barrow, Alaska, who are interested in using scientific methods to learn more about the history of their people, Hayes and a team of scientists extracted DNA from saliva samples given by 151 volunteers living in eight different North Slope communities. This is the first genetic study of modern-day I upiat people. For this paper, the scientists sequenced and analyzed only mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is passed down from mother to child, with few changes from generation to generation. Ninety-eight percent of the maternal linages in this group were of Arctic descent. The scientists found all known Arctic-specific haplogroups present in these North Slope communities. The haplogroups are: A2a, A2b, D4b1a and D2. D2 is the known haplogroup of ancient Paleo-Eskimos. Until this study D2 had only been found in the remains of ancient Paleo-Eskimos. D4b1a is a known haplogroup of the ancient Neo-Eskimos, the much more technologically sophisticated group that came after the Paleo-Eskimos and seemed to replace them and populate a large part of the Arctic in a short amount of time.  We think the presence of these two haplotypes in villages of the North Slope means that the Paleo-Eskimos and the Neo-Eskimos were both ancestors of the contemporary I upiat people,  said Jennifer A. Raff, first author of the study and a post-doctoral fellow in Hayes  lab at the Feinberg School when the research was being done.  We will be exploring these connections in the future with additional genetic markers.  Another haplogroup that surfaced in this study was C4. This is typically only seen in Native Americans much farther south. Its geographic distribution suggests that it might have been one of the haplogroups carried by the earliest peoples to enter the Americas. The researchers think it could be seen in the North Slope because of recent marriages between Athapascan and I upiat families or because it is a remnant of a much more ancient contact between these groups. One more surprise in this study was evidence there may have been some migrations of Greenlandic Inuit back to the Alaska North Slope. The scientists plan to explore this in the future with additional genetic markers, too. This work is part of the Genetics of the Alaskan North Slope project, funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation s Office of Polar Programs. The goal of the project is to reconstruct the human genetic history along the North Slope. The scientists hope the project will be a model for research partnerships between geneticists and indigenous peoples. While this study revealed exciting new evidence about the history and prehistory of I upiat women, it also confirms local history about the close-knit ties of the North Slope villages.  We found that there were many lineages shared between villages along the coast, suggesting that women traveled frequently between these communities,  Hayes said.  In fact, when we compared the genetic composition of all the communities in the North Slope, we found that they were all so closely related that they could be considered one single population. This fits well with what the elders and other community members have told us about I upiat history.  Future work will analyze genetic markers on the Y-chromosomes from men in the North Slope, taking a closer look at the population history of men, as well as how contact with outsiders in the 19th century affected the I upiat peoples.","Published: May 6, 2015"

The findings result from experiments led by electrical engineering Professor Krishna Shenoy, whose Stanford lab focuses on movement control and neural prostheses   such as artificial arms   controlled by the user's brain. ""This basic neuroscience discovery will help create neural prostheses that can withhold moving a prosthetic arm until the user is certain of their decision, thereby averting premature or inopportune movements,"" Shenoy said. The experiments are described in the journal eLife. They were performed by neuroscientist Matthew Kaufman while he was a graduate student in Shenoy's lab. Kaufman taught laboratory monkeys to perform a decision-making task. He then developed a technique to track the brain signals that occur during a single decision with split-second accuracy. This improvement on what's called the ""single trial decoder"" algorithm revealed the neural signals that occurred during a momentary hesitation or when the monkey changed its mind. ""We are seeing many cognitive phenomena in the brain for the first time,"" said Kaufman, who is now a postdoctoral scholar at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. ""The most critical result of our work here is that we can track a single decision and see how the monkey arrived there: whether he decided quickly, slowly, or changed his mind halfway through."" The experiments involved monkeys that were trained to reach for either of two targets on a computer screen. It was often possible to reach either target, inviting a free choice. Sometimes, one target was blocked, resulting in a forced choice. Other times, the researchers would switch between these configurations while the monkey was deciding, encouraging a change of mind. The research focused on the time the monkey spent deliberating, before the actual movement began. The monkeys were trained to sit motionless while two jittering targets were positioned on either side of a computer screen. Colored barriers on the screen created a simple maze. When the targets stopped jittering, the monkeys were trained to move to one or the other target by sweeping a fingertip through the maze until they touched one of the targets. During the experiments, 192 electrodes in each monkey's motor and premotor cortex began measuring brain activity the moment that the targets appeared on screen. The measurements continued until the targets stopped jittering and the monkey began to move. The interval between the targets' appearance and the beginning of movement marked the time of decision or, in some cases, hesitation. Using his single-trial decoder algorithm, Kaufman could analyze moment-by-moment brain activity during each individual decision. In a sense, he was able to read the monkey's mind during free choices, when each decision may be different. In previous experiments on decision-making, researchers have had monkeys perform many trials and average the readings they obtain to get summary statistics. But these older approaches do not allow researchers to identify unique or idiosyncratic events during any individual decision. ""We can now track single decisions with unprecedented precision,"" Kaufman said. ""We saw that the brain activity for a typical free choice looked just like it did for a forced choice. But a few of the free choices were different. Occasionally, he was indecisive for a moment before he made any plan at all. About one time in eight, he made a plan quickly but spontaneously changed his mind a moment later."" This deeper understanding of decision-making will help researchers to fine-tune the control algorithms of neural prostheses to enable people with paralysis to drive a brain-controlled prosthetic arm or guide a neurally-activated cursor on a computer screen. Two former Stanford postdocs also contributed to this paper: Mark M. Churchland, now an assistant professor at Columbia University, and Stephen I. Ryu, now a consulting professor of electrical engineering at Stanford and a neurosurgeon at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. Kaufman said the team's findings also bear on a longstanding philosophical debate about human consciousness. In the early 1980s, University of California, San Francisco neuroscientist Benjamin Libet conducted an experiment to assess the nature of free will. Subjects hooked up to an electroencephalogram (EEG) were asked to push a button whenever they liked. They were also asked to note the precise time they first became aware of the wish or urge to move. Libet's experiments showed that distinctive brain activity began, on average, several seconds before subjects became aware that they planned to move. Libet concluded that the desire to move arose unconsciously, and ""free will"" could only come in the form of a conscious veto: what he called ""free won't."" Kaufman said that the brain activity Libet saw does not imply a demise of free will. Instead, his results show that you can plan to make a particular movement but sometimes change your mind a second later. The moment of commitment to your choice might therefore happen late, just as Libet's subjects reported. ""Being able to see how each choice unfolds on a millisecond timescale may help make it possible to better study these kinds of slippery issues,"" Kaufman said.

A key challenge in neuroscience research is identifying organizational principles of how the brain integrates sensory information from its environment to generate behavior. One of the major determinants of these principles is the structural organization of the highly complex, interconnected networks of neurons in the brain. Dr. Oberlaender and his collaborators have developed novel techniques to reconstruct anatomically-realistic 3D models of such neuronal networks in the rodent brain. The resultant model has now provided unprecedented insight how neurons within and across the elementary functional units of the sensory cortex   cortical columns   are interconnected. The researchers found that in contrast to the decade-long focus of describing neuronal pathways within a cortical column, the majority of the cortical circuitry interconnects neurons across cortical columns. Moreover, these  trans-columnar  networks are not uniformly structured. Instead,  trans-columnar  pathways follow multiple highly specialized principles, which for example mirror the layout of the sensory receptors at the periphery. Consequently, the concept of cortical columns, as the primary entity of cortical processing, can now be extended to the next level of organization, where groups of multiple, specifically interconnected cortical columns form  intracortical units . The researchers suggest that these higher-order units are the primary cortical entity for integrating signals from multiple sensory receptors, for example to provide anticipatory information about future stimuli. Rodents are nocturnal animals that use facial whiskers as their primary sensory receptors to orient themselves in their environment. For example, to determine the position, size and texture of objects, they rhythmically move the whiskers back and forth, thereby exploring and touching objects within their immediate surroundings. Such tactile sensory information is then relayed from the periphery to the sensory cortex via whisker-specific neuronal pathways, where each individual whisker activates neurons located within a dedicated cortical column. The one-to-one correspondence between a facial whisker and a cortical column renders the rodent vibrissal system as an ideal model to investigate the structural and functional organization of cortical columns. In their April publication in Cerebral Cortex, Dr. Marcel Oberlaender, Dr. Bert Sakmann and collaborators describe how their research sheds light on the organization of cortical columns in the rodent brain through the systematic reconstruction of more than 150 individual neurons from all cell types (image [top] shows examples for each of the 10 cell types in cortex) of the somatosensory cortex s vibrissal domain (the area of the cortex involved in interpreting sensory information from the rodent s whiskers). In particular, the researchers combined neuronal labeling in the living animal, with custom-designed high-resolution 3D reconstruction technologies and integration of morphologies into an accurate model of the cortical circuitry. The resultant dataset can be regarded as the most comprehensive investigation of the cortical circuitry to date, and revealed surprising principles of cortex organization. First, neurons of all cell types projected the majority of their axon   the part of the neuron that transmits information to other neurons   far beyond the borders of the cortical column they were located in. Thus, information from a single whisker will spread into multiple cortical columns (image [bottom] shows how axons of neurons located in one cortical column project to all surrounding columns [white circles]). Second, these trans-columnar pathways were not uniformly structured. Instead, each cell type showed specific and asymmetric axon projection patterns, for example interconnecting columns that represent whiskers with similar distance to the bottom of the snout. Finally, the researchers showed that the observed principles of trans-columnar pathways could be advantageous, compared to any previously postulated cortex model, for encoding complex sensory information. According to Dr. Oberlaender, neuroscientist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics and guest-scientist at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience,  There has been evidence for decades that cortical columns are connected horizontally to neighboring columns. However, because of the dominance of the columnar concept as the elementary functional unit of the cortex, and methodological limitations that prevented from reconstructing complete 3D neuron morphologies, previous descriptions of the cortical circuitry have largely focused on vertical pathways within an individual cortical column.  The present study thus marks a major step forward to advance the understanding of the organizational principles of the neocortex and sets the stage for future studies that will provide extraordinary insight into how sensory information is represented, processed and encoded within the cortical circuitry.  Our novel approach of studying cortex organization can serve as a roadmap to reconstructing complete 3D circuit diagrams for other sensory systems and species, which will help to uncover generalizable, and thus fundamental aspects of brain circuitry and organization,  explained Dr. Oberlaender.

For children and adolescents, however, treatment regimens have tended to be more intense in order to treat depression quickly. Kaplin says that's because ""it is excruciatingly painful to wait for kids to respond when they are often already at the end of their ropes before meeting with a medical professional."" Young people rarely seek treatment for depression on their own, and it may take a while before parents become aware of their child's depression, he says. Once aware, parents may try other means of treatment before seeking medical attention. SSRI treatment, however, has proved to increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior (""suicidality"") in children and adolescents. In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning for SSRIs -- the most serious warning a prescription medicine can receive -- because in a summary examination of all drug company-sponsored studies, the drugs increased suicidal thoughts and action by 2 to 4 percent, compared with a placebo during the initial weeks after starting the medications. With over 10 percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. suffering from major depressive disorder, however, the black box warning had an unintended effect. ""The suicide rate has gone up,"" says Kaplin, apparently because clinicians hesitate to prescribe SSRIs even though there's greater risk of suicide from leaving major depressive disorder untreated. In their study, Kaplin and his team asked whether these early negative effects shortly after starting SSRIs could be mitigated either by the same kind of careful dosing done in adults with anxiety disorders or by combining SSRI treatment with another medication previously shown to hasten SSRIs' therapeutic effects in adults. The team began by analyzing the same data the FDA used in 2004 to issue its black box warning. They found that SSRIs made young patients more impulsive, particularly during the first month of treatment, but don't create suicidal thoughts where there were none before, Kaplin says. The researchers then performed a computer simulation to find optimal dosing for the faster-acting SSRIs -- paroxetine, citalopram, sertraline, venlafaxine and fluvoxamine -- in kids so that these other SSRIs would act in a similar way to fluoxetine, says Kaplin. Currently, fluoxetine, the slowest-acting SSRI, is the only SSRI that is FDA-approved for children 8 to 12. It can take several weeks or months for fluoxetine to reach therapeutic levels in the blood and begin to have an effect. When they tested their model, the researchers found that it generated the same kinds of dosing regimens psychiatrists use for dosing adults experiencing SSRIs' negative effects. Those regimens often start with half the normal initial dose and slowly increase it to achieve therapeutic levels. The newly proposed dosing guidelines likely would improve safety, but they would also slow how long it takes before patients receive relief, even from the faster-acting SSRIs. ""One of the hardest parts of our jobs is to get people through that delayed period of time when we all wish our medicines worked faster,"" says Kaplin. So the researchers also looked for a way to completely block SSRIs' negative effects. Working with mice, the researchers found that adding a molecule called WAY-100635 -- used in adult human research studies -- produced ""a synergistic effect when given with an SSRI,"" says Kristen Rahn, Ph.D., an instructor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and of neurology. ""And it completely alleviated the anxiety the animals had."" Given by itself, though, WAY-100635 had no significant effect on anxiety levels. The compound helps the brain get serotonin, a neurotransmitter. Long-term exposure to SSRIs eventually increases serotonin levels -- the goal of treatment -- but the initial exposure reduces serotonin. Researchers think it's this stop-start mechanism that explains why SSRIs cause adults' anxiety and increase children's impulsivity. Coupling SSRI treatment with WAY-100635 eliminates the stop-start and creates a smoother transition. ""Now that we have uncovered this effect and worked out this mechanism,"" says Kaplin, ""we are in the process of communicating with pharmaceutical companies to see which of them might have tested a drug similar to WAY-100635 that didn't do anything by itself and therefore was abandoned.""

The article describing the results of their studies is published in Genome Biology. Dmitry Andreev, PhD, senior research fellow at the A.N. Belozersky Institute Of Physico-Chemical Biology and Ivan Shatsky, PhD, professor at the same institute, described the results. ""The study became possible due to the development of techniques like next-generation sequencing (NGS), which made a real revolution in the life sciences. In particular, we used the ribosome profiling technique which allows the capture of a ""snapshot"" of all protein synthesis in the cell at a given time. The protein synthesis in the cell is driven by ribosomes, which are huge macromolecular machines capable of reading the information encoded in the messenger RNA and synthesizing corresponding proteins. At any time thousands of various proteins, are being synthesized by ribosomes. When a change in external conditions occurs, ribosomes can quickly switch to the other messenger RNA and begin to synthesize the proteins necessary for adaptation to new conditions. ""We decided to use this method to study the changes in gene expression in the cells upon oxygen and glucose deprivation,"" Dmitry Andreev explains. ""This is a model for studying ischemia."" Prolonged exposure to ischemia always leads to irreversible tissue damage, and as a consequence to the cell death. However, within a short time after the stress cells are still viable, what means they can rescued and thereby prevent the devastating effects of ischemia. That is why understanding of the processes occurring in a cell in the early hours, or even minutes after ischemia, can have a very important fundamental and practical significance. We have studied the early response to ischemia in the first hour after stress. It appeared that within 20 minutes after the stress significant changes in the synthesis of proteins occur. It is interesting that the most significant changes occur in the synthesis of proteins involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain. Apparently, the cell tries dramatically to adapt to new conditions and to switch to ""alternative"" energy sources in order to avoid death. The main paradigm of regulation of respiration in the cell signaling pathway is a family of transcription factors known as HIF (Hypoxia Inducible Factor). This transcription factor activates expression of several genes involved, for example, in glucose transport or in the formation of new blood vessels. Under normal conditions, when the oxygen in the cell is sufficient, specific prolyl hydroxylase enzymes constantly modify regulatory subunits of HIF sending it to the destruction. Thereby HIF remains turned off. Once the oxygen level in the cell falls below a threshold, prolyl hydroxylase, which requires oxygen for activity, turns off, while HIF stabilizes and begins to work. The HIF signaling cascade is also important because its activity is necessary for the survival of a variety of tumors as many cancer cells face with chronic shortage of oxygen due to defects in the blood supply, and in order to survive they have to adapt to the conditions of hypoxia. Therefore HIF is a very promising target for cancer therapy. As a indication of the scientific interest in this family, there are more than 12,000 scientific studies on the subject, since it was first identified in 1995. Importantly, we have found that the early changes in genes expression observed upon oxygen and glucose deprivation precede the response of the HIF transcription factors and do not overlap with it. Moreover, the new ways of regulation may directly affect the HIF signaling pathway. For example, one of the most striking cases of regulation is an increase in synthesis of UBE2S protein, which is directly involved in the degradation of regulatory HIF subunit. This is an early system of regulation that was not previously appreciated. There were no approaches that could reliably detect these early changes prior to the development of the ribosomal profiling method. ""We have many plans how to develop this subject, but at the moment we prefer not to share them as in this area of research there is a very serious competition, including scientists from the world's leading research centers. It is necessary to note that a very large contribution of all members of the team took place in this work and we look forward to continuing the collaboration with our colleagues"", Dmitry Andreev summed.Lomonosov Moscow State University Dmitry E Andreev, Patrick B.F.

If they fail, mutations accumulate in the genome that can lead to devastating diseases. DNA repair defects underlie predisposition to certain cancers, such as familial breast cancer, and promote the transformation process in other spontaneous cancers. DNA repair requires many factors, but so far there have not been comprehensive analyses of the intricate pathways involved. Using novel and highly sensitive proteomic technologies, scientists of the Max Planck Institute (MPI) of Biochemistry in Martinsried near Munich now report in the journal Science the first global analysis of the protein recruitment dynamics underlying a critical DNA repair pathway. Their results shed light on the repair mechanism and identified new proteins and drug targets that could be important in maintaining genomic stability and preventing cancer. During each cell division, more than 3.3 billion base pairs of genomic DNA have to be duplicated and segregated accurately to daughter cells. But what happens when the DNA template is damaged in such a way that the replication machinery gets stuck? To answer this question, scientists in the team of Matthias Mann at the MPI of Biochemistry, with colleagues in Copenhagen and at Harvard, have analyzed how the protein composition of the DNA replication machinery changes upon encountering damaged DNA. To monitor such changes, they isolated DNA at several time points during the replication and repair process, and quantified the bound proteins using mass spectrometry based proteomics. In contrast to the conventional approach of quantifying a few selected proteins, proteomic analysis allows the simultaneous quantification of thousands of proteins from a biological sample. Using this unbiased approach, they found that as the replication machinery collides with lesions in the DNA more than 90 proteins are recruited to help repair the damaged DNA. These include many known DNA repair factors, as well as new proteins of previously unknown function. Together with the team of Professor Mailand at the Center for Protein Research in Copenhagen, Denmark, they are now analyzing whether and how these proteins promote the repair process.  Many of these recruited proteins are essential for the faithful propagation of genomic information to daughter cells,  explains Markus R schle, first author of the study.  Because defects in DNA repair pathways are commonly observed in genetically inherited cancer syndromes, such as familially inherited breast cancer, it is possible that mutations in the new factors may contribute to genetic predisposition to cancers.  DNA modifying agents are among the most frequently used class of chemotherapeutics. They work particularly well if the cancer cells they attack already have defects in the corresponding DNA repair pathways, as it frequently occurs in breast cancer and other tumors. Adaptation of proteomics for clinical diagnostics may open completely new possibilities.  Acquiring proteomic profiles directly from the tumor tissue may help oncologists to rapidly find the optimal class and dose of drugs,  says Matthias Mann, director at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry.  Our hope is that this approach may lead to more effective therapies with fewer side effects. ","Published: May 5, 2015"

Top-line results from the study are anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2015. Results of the completed dose escalation stage, in which 22 patients participated, showed that all BL-8040 tested doses, up to 1.5 mg/kg, were found to be safe and well tolerated when administered in combination with Ara-C (Cytarabine). Building upon prior interim results, which included doses up to 1.25 mg/kg and were presented at the 2014 American Society for Hematology conference, the data indicate that BL-8040 exhibits robust single-agent activity, with a dramatic decrease in the amount of AML cells in the bone marrow and significant mobilization of these cells into the peripheral blood following two days of BL-8040 monotherapy, as well as direct induction of leukemia cell death. Based on the study s pharmacodynamic data, 1.5 mg/kg was chosen as the dose for use in the expansion stage of the study. In parallel to initiation of the expansion stage, additional patients will be recruited to assess one higher dose level of BL-8040, in order to further expand the therapeutic window of the drug.  We are greatly encouraged by these interim results and are excited to commence the final stage of this important trial,  said Dr. Kinneret Savitsky, Chief Executive Officer of BioLineRx.  We expect this stage to progress much more quickly than the dose-escalation stage of the trial, which required approval from the data safety monitoring committee before moving to the next dose level. We also expect to open additional sites for this stage of the trial. We look forward with much anticipation to announcing top-line results of the trial, which we expect in the fourth quarter of this year.  Dr. Savitsky continued,  Our expanding BL-8040 platform continues its track record of impressive achievements, including the recently reported successful top-line results from our Phase 1 safety and efficacy study for stem cell mobilization. We expect to provide the full set of results from this study at the European Hematology Association (EHA) Congress being held next month in Vienna, Austria.

Better yet, the compound can be delivered to the parasite in a way that leads to minimal side effects for the human host.  ""Belen [Cassera] has been researching the unique biochemistry of the malaria parasite since she was a Ph.D. student,"" said Carlier.

We are very optimistic that this new strategy to treat malaria could eventually contribute to global health."" The findings were published in April in Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters. New malaria drugs are desperately needed, because malaria parasites are gaining resistance to medications such as chloroquine and artemether. Malaria was responsible for an estimated 584,000 deaths in 2013. ""This is excellent chemistry being applied to a crucial biomedical problem,  said Paul Roepe, a professor of chemistry and a professor of biochemistry and cellular and molecular biology at Georgetown University, who was not involved in the research.  The need for new antimalarial drugs is dire, and the work by Carlier and Cassera provides both attractive lead compounds for drug development as well as important probes for dissecting a key antimalarial drug target, the non-mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis. This pathway does not exist in humans, making it an extremely attractive, specific target for antimalarial drug design.""  Carlier and Cassera are now focused on developing related compounds that will be effective against both the major African malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, as well as Plasmodium vivax, a major vector of malaria in South America and Asia.   Relapse is a particular problem in treating Plasmodium vivax malaria, and an ideal malaria drug would prevent relapse by killing dormant parasites in asymptomatic patients.  Carlier and Cassera have applied for funding to continue this work.  Without Paul Carlier s collaboration we would not be able to move this project to the next step,  Cassera said.

The researchers, including scientists from pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, report in an article that is being published as an advanced online publication in Nature Medicine on May 4, that their findings indicate  an underappreciated genomic heterogeneity  in mechanisms of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drugs that target the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation that drive some cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  If resistance that is this complex is constantly evolving before us, it may mean we need multiple targeted therapies in combination to stay ahead of the resistant cancer,  said Geoffrey Oxnard, MD, a thoracic oncologist and lung cancer researcher at Dana-Farber and senior author of the report. Since the initial discovery of EGFR mutations in lung cancer 10 years ago, EGFR targeted therapies such as erlotinib (Tarceva) and afatinib (Gilotrif) have become a fundamental component of lung cancer therapy. Though they can induce dramatic responses, they tend to lose their effectiveness after nine to 14 months of treatment because of the development of resistance. The most common cause of drug resistance is the development of a second EGFR mutation known as T790-M. To fight back, pharmaceutical companies are developing and testing next-generation inhibitors aimed at overcoming the T790-M resistance mutation.  One such drug, the AstraZeneca compound AZD9291, is showing promise against resistant NSCLC in the ongoing phase 1 AURA clinical trial. In the April 30 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, Dana-Farber s Pasi J nne, MD, PhD, and colleagues reported that AZD9291 shrank lung tumors in 61 percent of patients whose cancers had developed the T790-M resistance mutation. The median progression-free survival in these patients was 10 months. In the new Nature Medicine study, Oxnard and colleagues looked for mechanisms of resistance to AZD9291 by analyzing liquid biopsies from some of the first patients in the clinical trial whose disease progressed despite treatment with the drug. In effect, they were spying on the cancer s next strategy for evading the new drug. Rather than wait for tumor biopsy samples to become available, scientists captured  cell-free  DNA shed into the bloodstream by the tumor cells. Oxnard, working with researchers from the Belfer Institute for Applied Cancer Science at Dana-Farber, had recently developed an assay to detect and quantify EGFR mutations in cell-free DNA. By testing blood specimens at different times during treatment, the scientists identified that three subtypes of resistance emerged. In some patients, the cancer cells carrying the T790-M mutation acquired an additional EGFR mutation not seen before, labeled C797S, which blocked the AZD9291 from docking to the tumor cells, and causing the disease to advance. In some other patients, the drug failed to eliminate cells with the T790-M resistance mutation   but the C797S mutation was not the culprit. In still other patients, the cancer cells progressed, but the AZD9291 appeared to have eliminated the T790-M resistance mutation, suggesting some other resistance mechanism had taken control. The findings  highlight the need for novel strategies to inhibit EGFR even in the presence of this [C797S] mutation,  the authors said. That might mean designing new drugs that block the effect of the mutation. While EGFR inhibitors have lengthened lives and improved outcomes in patients with advanced NSCLC, experience has shown that resistance inevitably develops.  The quicker we can learn about drug resistance, the faster we can overcome it,  said Oxnard. He said the new study demonstrates the power of liquid biopsies of resistant cancers to identify the biological causes and   in the present case   report those mechanisms simultaneously with the publication of the clinical trial results for a new drug.

About 10 per cent of asthma sufferers do not respond to conventional medications due to the severity of their condition. UQ Institute of Molecular Bioscience s Associate Professor Mark Smythe said the research team was developing a new drug designed to offer patients a safer and more effective treatment.  Current inhaled steroids are designed to treat the symptoms of asthma, not the underlying cause,  Mr Smythe said.  Long-term use of current drug therapies can also cause unwanted side-effects, particularly when taking high doses of steroids.  Effects can include a reduced growth rate in children and the weakening of bones in adults.  The researchers are creating new drug therapies that target hematopoietic prostaglandin synthase (HPGD2S)   the enzyme responsible for the overproduction of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which plays a role in inflammation and allergies.  HPGD2 is well recognised as an enzyme which is involved in bringing on asthma, which makes it a valid target for new drug treatments,  Mr Smythe said. Mr Smythe and his colleagues have developed a HPGD2S compound that can be taken orally and can prevent PGD2 production in animals. To speed up the development of these potential drugs, Mr Smythe has partnered with a team of advisors from the biotechnology industry who have significant commercial and drug discovery experience.

The team observed the behaviour of free radicals - unstable molecules that seek electrons for stability and are known to cause cellular and DNA damage in the human body - in the coffee brewing process. For the first time they discovered that under certain conditions coffee can act as an antioxidant, a compound found in foods that helps stabilise free radicals. The findings, published in PLOS ONE, will lead to a deeper understanding of the brewing process, as well as the potential health benefits of coffee. Chief Chemist of Illycaff , Dr Luciano Navarini, approached Monash physicist Dr Gordon Troup, School of Physics and Astronomy, and his team in 2012 to conduct the research using state-of-the-art EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy.  Dr Troup was one of the first scientists to discover free radicals in coffee in 1988 and so it made sense for Illycaff    a world-leading coffee roasting company actively involved in coffee research   to collaborate with Dr Troup and his team on this significant piece of research into free radical and antioxidant behaviour in coffee,  Dr Navarini said.  The most important aim of this research was to better understand the development of stable free radicals during the roasting process and the possible influence exerted by developed radicals on the well-documented coffee antioxidant properties. We also wanted to evidence possible coffee constituents as a source of antioxidant activity.  Dr Troup worked with a team of researchers including Monash alumnus Dr Simon Drew from the University of Melbourne, who carried out the spectroscopy at the University of Melbourne.  Our research studied both the Arabica coffee bean itself and what happens to its stable free radical and antioxidant properties during the brewing process,  Dr Troup said.

Together, these genes - PARN and RTEL1 - explain about 7 percent of familial pulmonary fibrosis and strengthen the link between lung fibrosis and telomere dysfunction, according to the study, done in conjunction with the Yale Center for Genome Analysis, and which appears online in Nature Genetics.  Although RTEL1 had been previously linked to telomere biology, our finding that PARN was involved in telomere regulation and human disease was completely unexpected,  said senior author Dr. Christine Kim Garcia, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine and with the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development. About 50,000 people in the United States annually develop idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive disease that principally affects the elderly, according to the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation. Approximately one in 20 people have a close relative with the disease, in which case they are considered to have familial pulmonary fibrosis. Without a lung transplant, pulmonary fibrosis patients typically die within three years after diagnosis. The genetic research was made possible by UT Southwestern s highly active lung transplant program, said Dr. Garcia, who holds the Kern and Marnie Wildenthal President's Research Council Professorship in Medical Science.  My clinical colleagues are attuned to asking patients about their family history and letting patients know that we have an active research program investigating the inherited form of this disease,  said Dr. Garcia, whose lab focuses on defining the genetic underpinnings of adult-onset lung disease. The research team identified 99 families that had the inherited form of the disease, but did not have mutations in one of the previously identified genes. Using a technique known as exome sequencing, the researchers identified mutations in PARN and RTEL1 in 12 percent of these families.  There were statistically more mutations found in these two genes than you would expect by chance,  Dr. Garcia said. The researchers used a biological assay technique called quantitative PCR (or real-time polymerase chain reaction) to measure telomere lengths in these patients.  We found that the mean, age-adjusted telomere length of all rare variant carriers was significantly shorter than normal controls,  said the study s first author, Dr. Bridget Stuart, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and with the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development.  This finding implicates both genes in telomere maintenance as well as development of pulmonary fibrosis.  The new findings add to previous research led by Dr. Garcia that had identified mutations in three other genes as being linked to familial pulmonary fibrosis. Two of those genes, TERT and TERC, like PARN and RTEL1, affect telomere length. The third, SFTPA2, affects a protein expressed only in the fluid that bathes the lung s epithelial cells. Altogether, mutations in the five identified genes account for about 25 percent of all cases of familial pulmonary fibrosis.  Our ultimate goal is to gain a full understanding of what causes the genetic form of this disease so that effective medications can be developed,  Dr. Garcia said.","Published: May 5, 2015"

The study, published in Nature Medicine, was partially funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and more than 25 nonprofit foundations devoted to finding cures for childhood brain cancer.  Our results provide a glimmer of hope for treating this heartbreaking disease,  said Michelle Monje, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of neurology and neurological sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, California, a senior author of the study and a specialist in DIPG.  Caring for DIPG patients drives me to find new ways to treat them.  DIPG typically attacks children 4 to 9 years of age. Children progressively lose muscle control as the tumor rapidly attacks the pons, a region deep inside the brain that connects the brain to the spinal cord, and is difficult to reach and surgically remove. Despite radiation treatment, children usually survive for about nine months, and less than 1 percent survive longer than five years. Six years ago, Dr. Monje started to create and share cell cultures of patients  DIPG cells that could be studied in labs. In this study, she and her colleagues used cell cultures collected from 16 patients in the United States and Europe to search for drugs that could kill or stop the growth of DIPG cells. By performing experiments in petri dishes and with mice, they found that panobinostat, a drug designed to change the way cells regulate genes, may be effective at inhibiting DIPG growth and extending survival rates.  It s astounding. In only six years, scientists have gone from knowing virtually nothing about this tumor to understanding its underlying genetics and finding a potential therapy,  said Jane Fountain, Ph.D., program director, at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of NIH.  This study epitomizes collaborative medicine at work. It took a dedicated team of international scientists working with patients, families and foundations to get to this point.  The scientists began their work by performing high-throughput screening experiments, an advanced method for rapidly searching for effective compounds. The screening simultaneously tested 83 known or potential cancer drugs on each of the DIPG cell lines. They found that drugs called histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors consistently slowed DIPG growth. Several of these drugs block histone deacetylases, a group of enzymes that regulate genes by removing chemical tags, called acetyl groups, from histone proteins. The scientists saw similar results when they genetically blocked individual histone deacetylases in the DIPG cells. The scientists also analyzed the genes of each cell line. After reviewing the genetic and screening data they decided to focus on panobinostat, a drug designed to block multiple types of histone deacetylases. In petri dishes, they showed that panobinostat inhibited the growth of 12 out of 16 DIPG cell lines. When the scientists placed DIPG cells in the pons area of mice they found that systemic injections of panobinostat inhibited DIPG growth and extended survival.  All roads lead to histones,  said Dr. Monje.  Our results support the idea that histone modifications are the keys to understanding and treating DIPG.  Located in a cell s nucleus, histones are protein complexes that act like genetic spools wound with genes on chromosomes. Enzymes, including histone deacetylases, influence how chromosomes wind around histones by adding or removing chemical tags. In turn, the tagging indirectly, or epigenetically, controls whether a gene on a chromosome will be used, or expressed, in that cell. The scientists showed that panobistat may be effective at treating a variety of DIPG tumors. Approximately 80 percent of DIPG tumors have a specific mutation in a histone gene. This mutation, called H3K27M, blocks the ability of an enzyme called a methyltransferase from adding a chemical tag, called a methyl group, to the histone. Although the H3K27M mutation disrupts a different chemical tagging system, the scientists showed that panobinostat slowed the growth of a line of cells that had the mutation. Panobinostat also slowed the growth of DIPG cells that do not have that mutation. Finally the scientists showed that panobinostat may work in combination with other treatments. Studying H3K27M cells that developed resistance to panobinostat over time, they showed that GSKJ4, a drug that blocks the removal of methyl groups from histones, slowed tumor growth. Combining panobistat and GSKJ4 appeared to slow growth further, suggesting the two compounds work synergistically.  This may be a first step to finally improving the prognosis of this seemingly untreatable disease,  said Dr. Monje. Dr. Monje, together with the National Cancer Institute-supported Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium and Novartis, is planning to conduct clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of panobinostat for children with DIPG.","Published: May 5, 2015"

Both of these benefits, however, peaked one to three years after treatment and then diminished, according to results from an ongoing clinical trial funded by the National Eye Institute (NEI), part of the National Institutes of Health. The results published online in the New England Journal of Medicine focus on a subset of trial participants who routinely underwent extensive tests of their vision and imaging of the retina from baseline up to six years after treatment. These in-depth examinations revealed that the areas of treated retina rapidly gained visual sensitivity, expanded and then contracted.  Gene therapy for LCA demonstrated we could improve vision in previously untreatable and incurable retinal conditions,  said Samuel G. Jacobson, M.D., Ph.D., who led the clinical trial at the University of Pennsylvania s Scheie Eye Institute, Philadelphia.  Even though the current version of the therapy doesn t appear to be the permanent treatment we were hoping for, the gain in knowledge about the time course of efficacy is an opportunity to improve the therapy so that the restored vision can be sustained for longer durations in patients.  The results, announced at the 2015 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology annual meeting, contribute to the bigger picture of the potential benefits - and remaining problems to solve - in the field of gene therapy for LCA and other diseases that affect the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the eye. About 10 percent of people with LCA carry a mutated form of the gene RPE65, which makes a key protein found in the retinal pigment epithelium, a layer of cells that nourish the light sensors or photoreceptor cells of the retina. The RPE65 protein is critical for vision. In the retina, millions of photoreceptors detect light and convert it into electrical signals that are ultimately sent to the brain. Photoreceptors rely on the RPE65-driven visual cycle to recharge their light sensitivity. They also need RPE65 for their long-term survival. In LCA, the cells eventually die, muting eye-to-brain communication. Dr. Jacobson along with Artur V. Cideciyan, Ph.D., University of Pennsylvania, and William W. Hauswirth, Ph.D., University of Florida, Gainesville, began the trial in 2007. Fifteen people with LCA received retinal injections of a harmless virus engineered to carry healthy RPE65 genes. This gene therapy relies on viral vectors as a means to deliver instructions for making the desired protein. In this case, the virus was designed to produce healthy RPE65. Dr. Hauswirth led the group that designed and produced the virus-gene material for testing in patients.  Within days of the injections, some patients reported increases in their ability to see dim lights they had never seen before. It was remarkable for us to get this feedback that things were indeed changing positively,  said Dr. Jacobson. In addition to the rapid onset of greater light sensitivity, the researchers discovered changes to another component of vision that occurred slowly. Four of the 15 patients started relying on an area of the retina near the gene therapy injection site for seeing letters. Normally, the fovea with its high density of photoreceptors is responsible for seeing fine details.  For some patients, preferential use of the treated area for seeing letters came about spontaneously about a year after the gene therapy and remained functional for up to six years,  said Dr. Cideciyan, who reported these findings in Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science in January. For the current study, Dr. Jacobson s team also examined the relationship between structure and function in the retina. Importantly, these results showed that photoreceptors continued to die at the same rate as they do in the natural course of the disease, regardless of treatment. The researchers concluded that gene therapy with RPE65 boosted the visual cycle, but did not delay photoreceptor cell death. Hence, the short-term gains in visual function.  We now have six years of data showing that a gene therapy approach is safe and that it successfully improves vision in people with this blinding disease,  said Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D., director of NEI.  As with any application of a novel therapy, it now needs to be fine-tuned. More research is needed to understand the underlying biology and how we can preserve or restore photoreceptors for a lifetime. Restoring vision is at the heart of the NEI s Audacious Goals Initiative, an effort to strategically fund research aimed at developing the knowledge and technology to make this goal a reality.  Dr. Jacobson s latest results are consistent with another independent investigation performed at Moorfields Eye Hospital and University College London. Those investigators found that retinal sensitivity improved in their LCA patients treated with gene therapy, but then it diminished after 12 months. The current findings suggest a number of potential strategies for improving the outcome of gene therapy, Dr. Jacobson said. For example, the ability to stage the disease prior to gene therapy would help clarify the potential benefits for each individual. The treatment could then be guided to retinal areas that contain enough functional photoreceptors to respond. Select patients may benefit from a second round of gene therapy, or from having an adjacent area of the retina treated, or from combining gene therapy with medications designed to boost the visual cycle or to protect the retina from cell loss.  We ve been able to positively alter and extend the visual life of patients with LCA, and we now have to develop workable strategies for extending it even further,  Dr. Jacobson said.","Published: May 5, 2015"

The study shows that the new method speeds detection up considerably, when compared to existing methods--mainly visual inspection by a mine detection expert. ""Computer vision and human vision each have their specific strengths, which combine to work well together,"" said Ryan Kastner, a professor of computer science at the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego. ""For instance, computers are very good at finding subtle, but mathematically precise patterns while people have the ability to reason about things in a more holistic manner, to see the big picture. We show here that there is great potential to combine these approaches to improve performance."" Researchers worked with the U.S. Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SSC Pacific) in San Diego to collect a dataset of 450 sonar images containing 150 inert, bright-orange mines placed in test fields in San Diego Bay. An image dataset was collected with an underwater vehicle equipped with sonar. In addition, researchers trained their computer vision algorithms on a data set of 975 images of mine-like objects. In the study, researchers first showed six subjects a complete dataset, before it had been screened by computer vision algorithms. Then they ran the image dataset through mine-detection computer vision algorithms they developed, which flagged images that most likely included mines. They then showed the results to subjects outfitted with an electroencephalogram (EEG) system, programmed to detect brain activity that showed subjects reacted to an image because it contained a salient feature--likely a mine. Subjects detected mines much faster when the images had already been processed by the algorithms. Computer scientists published their results recently in the IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering. The algorithms are what's known as a series of classifiers, working in succession to improve speed and accuracy. The classifiers are designed to capture changes in pixel intensity between neighboring regions of an image. The system's goal is to detect 99.5 percent of true positives and only generate 50 percent of false positives during each pass through a classifier. As a result, true positives remain high, while false positives decrease with each pass. Researchers took several versions of the dataset generated by the classifier and ran it by six subjects outfitted with the EEG gear, which had been first calibrated for each subject. It turns out that subjects performed best on the data set containing the most conservative results generated by the computer vision algorithms. They sifted through a total of 3,400 image chips sized at 100 by 50 pixels. Each chip was shown to the subject for only 1/5 of a second (0.2 seconds) --just enough for the EEG-related algorithms to determine whether subject's brain signals showed that they saw anything of interest. All subjects performed better than when shown the full set of images without the benefit of prescreening by computer vision algorithms. Some subjects also performed better than the computer vision algorithms on their own. ""Human perception can do things that we can't come close to doing with computer vision,"" said Chris Barngrover, who earned a computer science Ph.D. in Kastner's research group and is currently working at SSC Pacific.

While many earlier studies have pointed to diabetes as a possible contributor to Alzheimer's, the new study -- in mice -- shows that elevated glucose in the blood can rapidly increase levels of amyloid beta, a key component of brain plaques in Alzheimer's patients. The buildup of plaques is thought to be an early driver of the complex set of changes that Alzheimer's causes in the brain. The research is published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation. ""Our results suggest that diabetes, or other conditions that make it hard to control blood sugar levels, can have harmful effects on brain function and exacerbate neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease,"" said lead author Shannon Macauley, PhD, a postdoctoral research scholar. ""The link we've discovered could lead us to future treatment targets that reduce these effects."" People with diabetes can't control the levels of glucose in their blood, which can spike after meals. Instead, many patients rely on insulin or other medications to keep blood sugar levels in check. To understand how elevated blood sugar might affect Alzheimer's disease risk, the researchers infused glucose into the bloodstreams of mice bred to develop an Alzheimer's-like condition. In young mice without amyloid plaques in their brains, doubling glucose levels in the blood increased amyloid beta levels in the brain by 20 percent. When the scientists repeated the experiment in older mice that already had developed brain plaques, amyloid beta levels rose by 40 percent. Looking more closely, the researchers showed that spikes in blood glucose increased the activity of neurons in the brain, which promoted production of amyloid beta. One way the firing of such neurons is influenced is through openings called KATP channels on the surface of brain cells. In the brain, elevated glucose causes these channels to close, which excites the brain cells, making them more likely to fire. Normal firing is how a brain cell encodes and transmits information. But excessive firing in particular parts of the brain can increase amyloid beta production, which ultimately can lead to more amyloid plaques and foster the development of Alzheimer's disease. To show that KATP channels are responsible for the changes in amyloid beta in the brain when blood sugar is elevated, the scientists gave the mice diazoxide, a glucose-elevating drug commonly used to treat low blood sugar. To bypass the blood-brain barrier, the drug was injected directly into the brain. The drug forced the KATP channels to stay open even as glucose levels rose. Production of amyloid beta remained constant, contrary to what the researchers typically observed during a spike in blood sugar, providing evidence that the KATP channels directly link glucose, neuronal activity and amyloid beta levels. Macauley and her colleagues in the laboratory of David M. Holtzman, MD, the Andrew B. and Gretchen P. Jones Professor and head of the Department of Neurology, are using diabetes drugs in mice with conditions similar to Alzheimer's to further explore this connection. ""Given that KATP channels are the way by which the pancreas secretes insulin in response to high blood sugar levels, it is interesting that we see a link between the activity of these channels in the brain and amyloid beta production,"" Macauley said. ""This observation opens up a new avenue of exploration for how Alzheimer's disease develops in the brain as well as offers a new therapeutic target for the treatment of this devastating neurologic disorder.""

And what's the best way of getting her drug-packed exosomes to the brain? It looks like a simple nasal spray will do the trick, say Elena Batrakova and her colleagues at the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy's Center for Nanotechnology in Drug Delivery. Batrakova and her colleagues extracted exosomes from immune cells and successfully loaded them with the enzyme catalase, a potent antioxidant that counters the neuron-killing inflammation responsible for Parkinson's and other degenerative neurological disorders. Their work was published in the Journal of Controlled Release. This is the first time a large therapeutic protein like catalase has been delivered to the brain using exosomes. Getting drugs into the brain is extremely difficult in general because it is protected and isolated from the rest of the body by the blood-brain barrier, which is extremely selective about what is allowed to pass through. Batrakova and her team at the pharmacy school harvested exosomes from macrophages, white blood cells that are responsible for clearing foreign material from the body. Exosomes are tiny spheres produced by cells to carry chemical messages. They are made of the same material that makes up cell membranes. Diseases like cancer and AIDS propagate throughout the body by hijacking exosomes. ""Exosomes are engineered by nature to be the perfect delivery vehicles for proteins and genetic material,"" Batrakova says. ""Catalase is a huge protein, and it is almost impossible to deliver across the blood-brain barrier alone. We use exosomes from white blood cells, which are invisible to the immune system and easily interact and fuse with the blood-brain barrier to deliver their cargo across it."" Catalase counteracts the effects of free radicals, destructive molecules that are byproducts of cellular activity and especially prevalent in areas of chronic inflammation. ""Catalase is one of the most potent antioxidants in nature,"" Batrakova says. ""One molecule of catalase can deactivate about one million free radicals per second, and it never stops because the enzyme is not consumed in the reaction. No small molecule drug even comes close to matching it in speed or efficiency."" Traditional drugs -- from cold medicine to chemotherapy -- are composed of small molecules of a few dozen atoms, typically. Biopharmaceuticals, or biologics, are proteins produced by living cells. Proteins such as catalase are tens of thousands of times larger than the small molecules that make up traditional drugs. Batrakova's goal is to develop personalized treatments by loading proteins into exosomes that have been extracted from a patient's own white blood cells. These packages of medicine will be ignored by the patient's immune system, which works against unknown proteins as well as many synthetic delivery vehicles.

A Loyola University Medical Center case study demonstrates that a virus called varicella-zoster can cause inflammation of blood vessels in the brain. This inflammation, known as cerebral vasculitis, can cause both hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic strokes. The study by Daniel Vela Duarte MD, David Pasquale, MD, and senior author Murray Flaster, MD, PhD, was presented during a meeting of the American Academy of Neurology 2015 annual meeting in Washington, D.C that ran from April 18-25. Varicella-zoster virus causes chickenpox in children and shingles in older adults. The virus  typically remains dormant in patients with healthy immune systems, but can reactivate if the immune system is compromised. Researchers reported the case of a 48-year-old man with HIV/AIDS. Doctors had prescribed a combination of HIV/AIDS drugs called highly active antiretroviral therapy, but for the previous seven years, the patient had not taken his medications. The patient presented with a very high HIV load and very low CD4 count. (CD4s are white blood cells that fight infections.) The man experienced a sudden weakness on the right side and difficulty speaking and understanding speech. Imaging scans showed he had suffered a hemorrhagic stroke, with bleeding directly into the substance of the brain. The researchers were able to demonstrate that the varicella-zoster virus was actively replicating within the patient's brain. Although rare, the condition may be more common in patients with compromised immune systems. However, it can be treated successfully when recognized.

The model was correct for 96% of the banks that went bust in the U.S. in 2013 after analyzing their financial indicators from the previous decade, marked by the economic crisis. The most vulnerable were those which had accumulated loans from the construction sector and grown rapidly without sufficient provisions. Since the economic crisis started in 2008 more than 300 banks have gone bust in the U.S., a country which has an extensive database of its 7,000 financial entities and where bankruptcies are published daily. This information, provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has helped to validate the model which two economists from the University of Valladolid (Spain) have developed to calculate the probability of  banks going bust. The researchers used financial indicators or ratios from North-American entities for the period between 2002 and 2012. From this data and operating in a different time period, the model managed to deduce how many would go bankrupt between May 2012 and December 2013. According to the study published in the journal  Expert Systems with Applications , the results were correct 96% of the time.  There are many analyses which can predict bankruptcy one year in advance, which is too short a timeframe to take preventative action,  as one of the authors, Iv n Pastor, told SINC (The Information and Scientific News Service). Pastor highlights the predictive capacity of their short, medium and long-term algorithms, which relate respectively to one, two and three years. The researcher points out that they created the model using neuronal networks, a set of algorithms which function by imitating the behavior of the human nervous system and which are very useful in detecting patterns. These are what predict the possibility of bankruptcy.  This methodology also generates a two-dimensional map which will help bank authorities and regulators to visualize the whole financial system and identify problematic entities in the very short-term, as well as solvent entities which could present problems in the long-term,  says Pastor. Thanks to these analyses the different routes which could lead a financial entity to bankruptcy could also be observed. By applying the model it is clear that those which presented a greater risk were those with a high concentration of construction-related loans, those which grew very rapidly, did not have a proper market capitalization and had low levels of provisions.  The results that we obtained for December 2013 demonstrated that the US financial system had improved compared to the darkest moments of the economic crisis, but there were still entities at high risk of going bankrupt, although they were generally minor entities,  adds Pastor, who recognizes that the model has not yet been updated with 2015 data,  although, given enough time, it could be done . The expert confirms that this methodology could be applied to learn the bankruptcy potential of financial entities in other countries, with the necessary readjustments and modifications to each nation s characteristics.  For example, some financial ratios employed in the US are not available in Spain, given that less information is public in our country,  adds Pastor, although he comments on another study currently in progress:  We are waiting for a study to be published on Spanish savings banks, where we analyze how many of them ended up bankrupt or bailed out, as well as identify the factors differentiating healthy and failed entities .

Researchers found that some receptors containing the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) are important to the development of AML, providing a target for potential therapies.  We showed that these receptors are expressed by AML cells and that they support the development of AML. Although counterintuitive, this result is consistent with the generally immune-suppressive and thus tumor-promoting roles of inhibitory receptors in the immune system,  said Dr. Chengcheng  Alec  Zhang, Associate Professor of Physiology and Developmental Biology, and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.  These findings suggest that blocking ITIM-receptor signaling in combination with conventional therapies may represent a novel strategy for AML treatment.  AML is a type of blood and bone marrow cancer in which certain stem cells or progenitor cells fail to properly mature into healthy white blood cells and instead become abnormal red cells, called leukemia cells, according to the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. Leukemia cells can build up in the bone marrow and blood so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, which can result in infections, anemia, or bleeding. Leukemia cells also can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body, including the central nervous system, skin, and gums, according to the NCI. Symptoms of adult AML include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding. The study, which appears in Nature Cell Biology, focused mainly on an ITIM-containing receptor called LAIR1. Researchers found that deleting LAIR1 abolished leukemia development in several different mouse models of leukemia. They also identified an important pathway that sustains the survival and self-renewal of AML cells, the mechanism by which LAIR1 supports AML development.  Our study suggests that current treatment options, including chemotherapy, may not efficiently target cancer stem cells because these inhibitory receptors enable the leukemia stem cells to survive conventional therapies, eventually resulting in tumor relapse,  said Dr. Zhang, Michael L. Rosenberg Scholar in Medical Research.  The blockade of ITIM-receptor signaling may prove to be a novel, effective strategy for elimination of leukemia stem cells and lead to complete remission in patients.  Treatments for AML generally yield poor outcomes, especially for typical senior patients, Dr. Zhang noted. Despite continuous treatment, most AML patients relapse within 5 years, according to published outcome studies. The medical need for new therapies for AML is further underscored by the fact that no new therapies for AML have been approved in over 30 years. There are more than 50 experimental agents in clinical trials for the treatment of AML, but only a few agents have yielded promising data to date, he noted.  New molecular targets and therapeutic strategies are needed for AML treatment,  he said. The Zhang laboratory studies the roles of immune inhibitory receptors in stem cells and cancer. Dr. Zhang hopes to understand the molecular mechanisms that govern the fates of adult stem cells and cancer cells, and apply this knowledge to the development of new cell and antibody therapies for treating cancer and other diseases.","Published: May 2, 2015"

Following the introduction of a comprehensive serialization service last year, the company has now implemented product serialization for secondary packaging for one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies. In accordance with the requirements from the South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) Vetter's solution identifies the drugs on the folding boxes via a 2-D data matrix code with a serial number, GTIN, expiry date, and batch number. As the number of counterfeit drugs continues to grow, regulatory authorities around the world areincreasingly relying on clear identification of products through serialization. They are demandingthat the smallest packaging unit be marked with a single-use identification number. South Korea is among those countries requiring serialization with an aim towards protecting againstcounterfeiting, as well as a more secure supply chain. ""Together with our customer, we prepared for these requirements very early on,"" says Thomas Otto, managing director at Vetter. ""We have been active in filling and final packaging for the company for years. Thanks to our serialization service, our partner can now meet the regulatory requirements for South Korea. We are, however, also aware of the fact that regulatory requirements differ from one country to the next. Therefore, we offer pharma and biotech companies a wide range of options that will give them flexibility when reacting to different regulatory standards."" Presently, South Korea has only asked for serialization on the folding package. China, however,has legislated use of 1-D linear codes including aggregation with the shipping box. As such, Vetterprovides a broad variety of services in secondary packaging, primary packaging and final assembly that give its customers a great deal of flexibility to accommodate various regulatory ormarket needs. The company's comprehensive serialization service includes a range of formats for serial numbers, different code systems; such as a 2-D data matrix codes, interfaces and reports, as well as various aggregation depths. Pharmaceutical and biotech companies can use Vetter's individually customizable solutions as basis for their own track-and-trace programs to optimize their supply chain.","Published: May 2, 2015"

Researchers in China have recently described their experiments in a nonviable human embryo to modify the gene responsible for a potentially fatal blood disorder using a gene-editing technology called CRISPR/Cas9. Genomic editing is already widely studied in a variety of organisms. For example, CRISPR/Cas9 has greatly shortened the time it takes to produce knockout mouse models of disease, enabling researchers to study more easily the underlying genetic causes of those diseases. This technology is also being used to develop the next generation of antimicrobials, which can specifically target harmful strains of bacteria and viruses. In the first clinical application of genomic editing, a related genome editing technique (using a zinc finger nuclease) was used to create HIV-1 resistance in human immune cells, bringing HIV viral load down to undetectable levels in at least one individual. All of these examples of research using genomic editing technologies can and are being funded by NIH. However, NIH will not fund any use of gene-editing technologies in human embryos. The concept of altering the human germline in embryos for clinical purposes has been debated over many years from many different perspectives, and has been viewed almost universally as a line that should not be crossed. Advances in technology have given us an elegant new way of carrying out genome editing, but the strong arguments against engaging in this activity remain. These include the serious and unquantifiable safety issues, ethical issues presented by altering the germline in a way that affects the next generation without their consent, and a current lack of compelling medical applications justifying the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in embryos. Practically, there are multiple existing legislative and regulatory prohibitions against this kind of work. The Dickey-Wicker amendment prohibits the use of appropriated funds for the creation of human embryos for research purposes or for research in which human embryos are destroyed (H.R. 2880, Sec. 128). Furthermore, the NIH Guidelines state that the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee,  will not at present entertain proposals for germ line alteration . It is also important to note the role of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in this arena, which applies not only to federally funded research, but to any research in the U.S. The Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act give the FDA the authority to regulate cell and gene therapy products as biological products and/or drugs, which would include oversight of human germline modification. During development, biological products may be used in humans only if an investigational new drug application is in effect (21 CFR Part 312). NIH will continue to support a wide range of innovations in biomedical research, but will do so in a fashion that reflects well-established scientific and ethical principles.","Published: May 2, 2015"

Western diets, high in protein and fat but low in fibre, are thought to raise colon cancer risk compared with African diets high in fibre and low in fat and protein. The new study, published in Nature Communications, confirms that a high fibre diet can substantially reduce risk, and shows that bacteria living in the gut play an important role in this effect. Colon cancer is the fourth commonest cause of death from cancer worldwide, accounting for over 600 000 deaths per year. Colon cancer rates are much higher in the western world than in Africa or the Far East, yet in the United States, African Americans shoulder the greatest burden of the disease. To investigate the possible roles of diet and gut bacteria, an international team including scientists from the University of Pittsburgh and Imperial College London carried out a study with a group of 20 African American volunteers and another group of 20 participants from rural South Africa. The two groups swapped diets under tightly controlled conditions for two weeks. The volunteers had colonoscopy examinations before and after the diet swap. The researchers also measured biological markers that indicate colon cancer risk and studied samples of bacteria taken from the colon. At the start, when the groups had been eating their normal diets, almost half of the American subjects had polyps - abnormal growths in the bowel lining that may be harmless but can progress to cancer. None of the Africans had these abnormalities. After two weeks on the African diet, the American group had significantly less inflammation in the colon and reduced biomarkers of cancer risk. In the African group, measurements indicating cancer risk dramatically increased after two weeks on the western diet. Professor Jeremy Nicholson, the team leader from the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College London, said: ""We can't definitively tell from these measurements that the change in their diet would have led to more cancer in the African group or less in the American group, but there is good evidence from other studies that the changes we observed are signs of cancer risk."" ""The findings suggest that people can substantially lower their risk of colon cancer by eating more fibre. This is not new in itself but what is really surprising is how quickly and dramatically the risk markers can switch in both groups following diet change. These findings also raise serious concerns that the progressive westernization of African communities may lead to the emergence of colon cancer as a major health issue."" Professor Stephen O'Keefe at the University of Pittsburgh, who directed the study, said: ""Studies on Japanese migrants to Hawaii have shown that it takes one generation of westernization to change their low incidence of colon cancer to the high rates observed in native Hawaiians. Our study suggests that westernization of the diet induces changes in biomarkers of colon cancer risk in the colonic mucosa within two weeks. Perhaps even more importantly, a change in diet from a westernized composition to a 'traditional African' high fiber low fat diet reduced these biomarkers of cancer risk within two weeks, indicating that it is likely never too late to change your diet to change your risk of colon cancer."" The study found that a major reason for the changes in cancer risk was the way in which the bacteria in the gut - known as the microbiome - altered their metabolism to adapt to the new diet. In the American group, the researchers found that the African diet led to an increase in the production of butyrate, a byproduct of fibre metabolism that has important anti-cancer effects. Dr James Kinross, a colorectal surgeon and a member of the research group at Imperial, said: ""The gut microbiome is being increasingly recognized as an important contributor to human health. This research shows that gut bacteria are critically important for mediating the link between diet and colon cancer risk. This means we can look to develop therapies targeting gut bacteria as a way to prevent and treat cancer.""","Published: May 2, 2015"

In addition, Dr. Miguel Forte, previously SVP Clinical and Regulatory, is promoted to Chief Operating Officer. St phane Boissel succeeds Damian Marron, who has resigned from the company to pursue other interests. One of the main initial tasks for St phane will be to continue to strengthen the visibility of TxCell within the investment community, specifically in the US and the EU, and to continue to develop TxCell through its pipeline of products and partnerships. Specifically, St phane will continue to develop the exclusive worldwide license option agreement signed by Ferring International Center (SA) (Ferring) and TxCell in December 2013 for development of TxCell s lead product Ovasave  for the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The agreement was enhanced with an assignment by Ferring to Trizell Holding SA (Trizell) (see release of January 2, 2015). Both companies are affiliates of the Dr Frederik Paulsen Foundation. It was further recently expanded to bring forward the phase III development and commercialization of TxCell s lead product Ovasave and funding from Trizell, (see release of April 23, 2015). Ferring remains the intended final commercializing party for Ovasave in IBD. Dr. Miguel Forte will focus directly on the development of the TxCell product portfolio and the supply chain. Ovasave, TxCell s lead product, is currently in a phase IIb clinical trial for refractory Crohn s disease (CATS29 study - see release of Dec 4, 2014). Top line results of this study are expected at the end of 2016 / early 2017. Miguel will also continue to develop Col-Treg, its second product candidate from its ASTrIA platform. Col-Treg is set to start a phase I/II proof of principle clinical study in autoimmune uveitis mid-2015.  TxCell is now entering a next stage of development as a public company with a strong and enhanced partnership with a pharmaceutical firm. As a result, I am delighted to welcome St phane Boissel as CEO. St phane brings a wealth of experience and a solid track record both in private and listed biotech companies. The appointment of Stephen, combined with Dr. Miguel Forte in his new extended role as COO, means TxCell is ideally placed to advance to the next stage of development,  said Fran ois Meyer, Executive Chairman of the TxCell Board.  TxCell will continue to accelerate the development of its growing product candidates emerging from ASTrIA, its unique, proprietary cellular therapy platform of personalized T-cell immunotherapies to treat chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.   TxCell has made great steps in turning its cutting edge science and technology into a viable and recognized business and financial model,  said St phane Boissel.  I look forward to using my experience in public immunotherapy companies to ensure that TxCell s innovative approach will be brought to patients with serious conditions who have few or no therapeutic options.  St phane Boissel is a highly capable executive with strong experience in both investment banking and the biotech immunotherapy space. Prior to joining TxCell, St phane was CEO of Genclis, a molecular diagnostic company. He was previously EVP and CFO of Transgene SA (2010 to 2014). Mr. Boissel has also worked at Innate Pharma SA, firstly as CFO and then as EVP and CFO (2002 to 2010). During his tenure at both Transgene and Innate Pharma, he led several rounds of private and public placement totaling more than EUR 150 million. He has also negotiated several major business deals in the US, EU and Asia. In the early part of his career, St phane joined the investment banking group Lazard, where he mostly worked in principal investment in France, Singapore and Hong Kong (1994 to 2002). He studied management and finance at the University of Lyon, France, graduated at Paris-Dauphine and obtained his MBA from the Chicago Booth Graduate Business School, US. In addition to his role as COO of TxCell, Miguel Forte is also Chair of the Commercialization Committee for the International Society of Cellular Therapy, and a Fellow of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine of the RCP (UK). Appointed to TxCell as CMO in 2010, Miguel brought 17 years of broad pharmaceutical industry experience from UCB, Nabi Pharmaceuticals, Bristol-Myers Squibb and the European Medicines Agency.  Finally, I also would like to thank Damian Marron for his period as CEO of TxCell. This includes transitioning TxCell from a private to a publically traded company. We all wish him well in his future endeavors,  said Fran ois Meyer.  It has been a great privilege to be the CEO for TxCell.

Nothing good. It's besieged by destructive particles that can forever impair cognition, according to a University of California - Irvine (UCI) radiation oncology study appearing in the May 1 edition of Science Advances. Charles Limoli and colleagues found that exposure to highly energetic charged particles -- much like those found in the galactic cosmic rays that bombard astronauts during extended spaceflights -- cause significant damage to the central nervous system, resulting in cognitive impairments. ""This is not positive news for astronauts deployed on a two- to three-year round trip to Mars,"" said Limoli, a professor of radiation oncology in UCI's School of Medicine. ""Performance decrements, memory deficits, and loss of awareness and focus during spaceflight may affect mission-critical activities, and exposure to these particles may have long-term adverse consequences to cognition throughout life."" For the study, rodents were subjected to charged particle irradiation (fully ionized oxygen and titanium) at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at the Brookhaven National Laboratory before being sent back to Limoli's Irvine lab. The researchers found that exposure to these particles resulted in brain inflammation, which disrupted the transmission of signals among neurons. Imaging revealed how the brain's communication network was impaired through reductions in the structure of nerve cells called dendrites and spines. Additional synaptic alterations in combination with the structural changes interfered with the capability of nerve cells to efficiently transmit electrochemical signals. Furthermore, these differences were parallel to decreased performance on behavioral tasks designed to test learning and memory. Similar types of more severe cognitive dysfunction are common in brain cancer patients who have received various photon-based radiation treatments at much higher doses. In other research, Limoli studies the impact of chemotherapy and cranial irradiation on cognition. While cognitive deficits in astronauts would take months to manifest, Limoli said, the time required for a mission to Mars is sufficient for such deficits to develop. People working for extended periods on the International Space Station do not face the same level of bombardment with galactic cosmic rays, as they are still within the protective magnetosphere of Earth. The irradiated particles that compose these galactic cosmic rays are mainly remnants of past supernova events. Limoli's work is part of NASA's Human Research Program. Investigating how space radiation affects astronauts and learning ways to mitigate those effects are critical to further human exploration of space, and NASA needs to consider these risks as it plans for missions to Mars and beyond. But what can be done to protect astronauts speeding off to the red planet? As a partial solution, Limoli said, spacecraft could be designed to include areas of increased shielding, such as those used for rest and sleep. However, these highly energetic particles will traverse the ship nonetheless, he noted, ""and there is really no escaping them."" Preventative treatments offer some hope. ""We are working on pharmacologic strategies involving compounds that scavenge free radicals and protect neurotransmission,"" Limoli said.

This unique tool   the first to result from the NIH BRAIN Initiative   will help scientists understand how to modulate neurons to more effectively treat diseases.Researchers at the University of North Carolina (UNC) School of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have perfected a noninvasive  chemogenetic  technique that allows them to switch off a specific behavior in mice   such as voracious eating   and then switch it back on. The method works by targeting two different cell surface receptors of neurons that are responsible for triggering the specific chemical signals that control brain function and complex behaviors. When this complex signaling system goes awry, the results can lead to a plethora of diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer s Disease, Parkinson s Disease, eating disorders, and epilepsy. Cell surface receptors also play roles in cancers, diabetes, digestive conditions, and other diseases. This new technique could be modified to study them, as well. This is the first technology to stem from the initial set of NIH BRAIN Initiative grants to create new cutting-edge research tools to improve our understanding of the brain.  This new chemogenetic tool will show us how brain circuits can be more effectively targeted to treat human disease,   said Bryan L. Roth, MD, PhD, the Michael Hooker Distinguished Professor of Protein Therapeutics and Translational Proteomics at the UNC School of Medicine.  The problem facing medical science is that although most approved drugs target these brain receptors, it remains unclear how to selectively modulate specific kinds of receptors to effectively treat disease.  Roth, who is also a member of the UNC Neuroscience Center and the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, addressed this problem by inventing a technology he dubbed  DREADDs    Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by a Designer Drug. The first-generation DREADD technology was developed in 2007. Essentially, in lab experiments, Roth s team altered the chemical structure of G protein-coupled receptors so that the receptors expressed synthetic proteins when reintroduced into a mouse. This way, the mutated receptor could only be activated or inhibited by a specific synthesized drug-like compound. The receptor became like a lock; the synthetic drug became the only key that fit the lock. Depending on what Roth s team wanted to study, they could lock or unlock the specific brain circuits and behaviors associated with that one receptor. This DREADD technology   also known as chemogenetics   is now used by hundreds of labs worldwide. It helped revolutionize our understanding of how brain circuits control normal and abnormal behavior, emotions, perception, pain sensation, memory, and many other processes. DREADDs have been used to improve the function of insulin-producing cells in mice as a way of treating diabetes. DREADD technology has also helped scientists treat epileptic seizures in mice. But scientists could use this first DREADD to only manipulate a single receptor in one direction   excite the receptor or inhibit it. Last year, Roth and UNC colleagues Thomas Kash, PhD, and Jian Jin, PhD, received a $2.84-million NIH BRAIN Initiative grant to develop the next generation of DREADDs. Today in the journal Neuron, UNC and NIH researchers revealed the first fruit of that grant   a new chemogenetic technology they have named KORD (k-opioid receptor DREADD). This new tool, co-invented by Roth and Eyal Vardy, PhD, a former UNC postdoctoral fellow, can target two different kinds of receptors on the same neuron sequentially. This allowed them to study the function of two kinds of receptors as they relate to each other. In the Neuron paper, Roth s team explain how they modified the receptors in the lab, packaged the receptors in an  viral vector, and injected them into mice so that the synthetic receptors were expressed only in certain kinds of neurons in specific parts of the brain. Then they administered the synthetic drug-like compound to demonstrate how neuronal signaling could be manipulated to turn the same neurons  on  and  off  and thereby turning  on  and  off  specific behaviors in mice. In one type of experiment, the NIH lab of Michael Krashes, PhD, was able to turn  on  and  off  voracious feeding behavior in mice. In another type of experiment, UNC researchers were able to turn  on  and  off  behaviors similar to those induced by drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines. Elliot Robinson, an MD/PhD student at UNC and co-first author of the Neuron paper, said,  These experiments have validated KORD as a new tool for researchers interested in controlling the function of specific populations of cells while also highlighting their therapeutic potential.  Reid Olsen, UNC graduate student and paper co-author, said,  Using genetically modified mice, we can now tease apart the interactions between seemingly disparate neuronal systems in a logical fashion.  Roth added,  We are now sharing KORD and other DREADD technology freely with other scientists, and it is likely that new uses for these technologies will appear in the near future.

In a new study from Sweden's Karolinska Institutet, neuroscientists created an out-of-body illusion in participants placed inside a brain scanner. They then used the illusion to perceptually 'teleport' the participants to different locations in a room and show that the perceived location of the bodily self can be decoded from activity patterns in specific brain regions. The sense of owning one's body and being located somewhere in space is so fundamental that we usually take it for granted. To the brain, however, this is an enormously complex task that requires continuous integration of information from our different senses in order to maintain an accurate sense of where the body is located with respect to the external world. Studies in rats have shown that specific regions of the brain contain GPS-like 'place cells' that signal the rat's position in the room -- a discovery that was awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. To date, however, it remains unknown how the human brain shapes our perceptual experience of being a body somewhere in space, and whether the regions that have been identified in rats are involved in this process. In a new study, published in the scientific journal Current Biology, the scientists created an out-of-body illusion in fifteen healthy participants placed inside a brain scanner. In the experiment, the participants wore head-mounted displays and viewed themselves and the brain scanner from another part of the room. From the new visual perspective, the participant observes the body of a stranger in the foreground while their physical body is visible in the background, protruding from the bore of the brain scanner. To elicit the illusion, the scientist touches the participant's body with an object in synchrony with identical touches being delivered to the stranger's body, in full view of the participant. ""In a matter of seconds, the brain merges the sensation of touch and visual input from the new perspective, resulting in the illusion of owning the stranger's body and being located in that body's position in the room, outside the participant's physical body,"" says Arvid Guterstam, lead author of the present study. In the most important part of the study, the scientists used the out-of-body illusion to perceptually 'teleport' the participants between different places in the scanner room. They then employed pattern recognition techniques to analyze the brain activity and show that the perceived self-location can be decoded from activity patterns in specific areas in the temporal and parietal lobes. Furthermore, the scientists could demonstrate a systematic relationship between the information content in these patterns and the participants' perceived vividness of the illusion of being located in a specific out-of-body position. ""The sense of being a body located somewhere in space is essential for our interactions with the outside world and constitutes a fundamental aspect of human self-consciousness,"" says Arvid Guterstam. ""Our results are important because they represent the first characterization of the brain areas that are involved in shaping the perceptual experience of the bodily self in space."" One of the brain regions from which the participants' perceived self-location could be decoded was the hippocampus -- the structure in which the Nobel Prize awarded 'place cells' have been identified.

The results, he says, could soon mark a new standard for treatment-not only for diabetes, but for several other diseases as well. Shapiro, Canada Research Chair in Transplantation Surgery and Regenerative Medicine in the University of Alberta s Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, and Andrew Pepper, a post-doctoral fellow working in his lab, are the lead authors in a study published in the April 20 edition of the journal Nature Biotechnology. In the study, the authors describe developing a new site for islet transplantation under the skin, which they believe will offer less risk and far greater health benefits for patients. Islet transplantation is a procedure that temporarily allows people with severe diabetes to stop taking insulin.  Until now it has been nearly impossible for transplanted cells to function reliably when placed beneath the skin,  says Shapiro.  In these studies, we have harnessed the body s natural ability to respond to a foreign body by growing new enriching blood vessels. By controlling this reaction, we have successfully and reliably reversed diabetes in our preclinical models. This approach is new and especially exciting as it opens up a new world of opportunities, not only in diabetes, but also across the board in regenerative medicine.  Evolving the Edmonton Protocol The new technique, tested in preclinical models, is an evolution of the Edmonton Protocol, which Shapiro developed in the late 1990s to treat Type 1 diabetes. In the Edmonton Protocol, islet cells are transplanted into the liver, granting patients insulin independence for a varying amount of time. The protocol was hailed as a revolutionary treatment, but Shapiro quickly realized the liver wasn t the ideal site for transplantation.  When we put islets in the liver, most of them get destroyed in a matter of minutes to hours, and we don t have a very good way to stop that,  he says.  As we turn to the future possibility of transplanting human stem cells in place of islets, we need a better, safer site to implant experimental cells. The skin offers a remarkable opportunity, provided we can enrich its blood supply to accommodate the needs of implanted cells.  As Shapiro s team began testing alternatives, sites underneath the skin first proved inhospitable for the cells due to a lack of blood vessels needed for the islets to grow and reproduce. As part of their research, though, they found that by inserting a temporary catheter tube under the skin, they could induce new blood vessels to grow, making an ideal home for islet transplantation.  In the paper, what we show is that when we put the cells under the skin on their own, they fail every single time,  says Shapiro.  They never engraft. If we put the cells into a site that s been prepared by what we call our  deviceless  approach, then we can get the cells to engraft highly efficiently.   This is a promising new procedure of transplanting cells into a site with the body that until now has historically failed,  says Pepper.  We have clearly demonstrated that our novel technique has the potential to be applied safely and easily to patients.  While the new transplant approach offers several benefits to diabetes patients, the researchers are equally excited by how it may be applied to other illnesses. Shapiro says his team is also testing its use in stem cell transplantations-which, if successful, could safely open the door to allow for assessment of emerging stem cell treatments.  It opens up the possibility of being able to transplant stem cells into patients in a site that can be removed,  says Shapiro.  That s been a big focus when you ve got a new cell line that s never been tested in patients before. The ability to take the cells out if there s a problem is very important.  Shapiro adds,  This exciting new approach doesn t have to be limited to diabetes. For any area of regenerative medicine that requires replacing old cells with new-and there s lots of different disease states where there s just one gene defect that could be corrected by a cell transplant-this opens up an incredible future possibility for successful engraftment beneath the skin.  Shapiro has filed a patent for the new transplant technique and hopes to begin human trials in the very near future.","Published: May 1, 2015"

Lignin is a vital industrial polymer but presents significant challenges when it comes to measurement of the properties that define its performance. Through experimental study Malvern has identified the best strategy to apply when using gel permeation/size exclusion chromatography (GPC/SEC) to secure reliable information. The results of this work will also be presented at the 13th Annual UNESCO/IUPAC Conference on Macromolecules and Materials, South Africa, September 8 - 10; and the 18th International Symposium on Wood, Fiber and Pulping Chemistry, Austria, September 9 - 11. Lignin is a natural polymer, derived from wood and other vascular plants, that finds application as, for example, a biofuel, a dispersant in high performance cement, and oilfield additive. GPC/SEC is used to measure the molecular weight (MW), MW distribution, viscosity and structural properties that control its performance. However, lignin has an unusual molecular structure in solution which compromises data accuracy when conventional, single detector, calibration-based GPC/SEC is applied. Malvern s solution exploits the capabilities of multi-detector GPC/SEC. This involves the use of a light scattering detector to directly measure MW without any requirement for calibration. Here though, the tendency for lignin to fluoresce in solution, thereby distorting light scattering data, can be problematic. The data from Malvern shows how careful choice of experimental conditions and methods can overcome challenges in the measurement of lignins and provide reliable results. A comparison of lignins from different sources, using a Mark-Houwink plot generated from the resulting data, highlights the robustness of the method in obtaining valuable insight into the structure of these polymers.","Published: May 1, 2015"

These findings were published in the leading journal Science Translational Medicine and suggest potential for the antibody candidate in cancer immunotherapy.  Combining the expertise of the de Duve Institute/UCL/WELBIO in cancer immunology with arGEN-X s proprietary SIMPLE Antibody  platform led to the discovery of ARGX-115, a highly differentiated monoclonal antibody that inhibits the novel immune checkpoint GARP,  commented Hans de Haard, Chief Scientific Officer of arGEN-X.  We believe there is potential for ARGX-115 as a future cancer immunotherapy as it inhibits specific downstream effects of regulatory T-cells (Tregs), a known contributor to cancer progression through the inhibition of anti-tumor immune responses. Additionally, there may be possibilities to use ARGX-115 in combination with tumor vaccines or other therapeutic antibodies in order to improve the efficiency of cancer immunotherapy regimens.  Sophie Lucas, leading the research group at de Duve Institute working on ARGX-115, emphasizes:  This monoclonal antibody is the first therapeutic agent to show an inhibitory activity on the immunosuppressive function of human Tregs. The relevance of GARP in converting inactive TGF-  into its active form on Tregs was now convincingly demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo models by the neutralizing antibody. ARGX-115 highlights the importance of active TGF-  production in immunosuppression by human Tregs, and provides means to inhibit this immunosuppression in vivo.  ARGX-115 Re-Activates Immunity to CancerIn cancer patients, tumors grow as they escape from immune surveillance. Tumors can suppress the immune system by co-opting different immunosuppressive cells such as Tregs, which exert contact-dependent inhibition of immune cells through the production of active TGF- . On the Treg cell surface, membrane protein GARP regulates the production of active TGF- . Preclinical studies completed at de Duve Institute/UCL/WELBIO show ARGX-115 can inhibit the immunosuppressive activity of human Tregs by binding to GARP in complex with inactive TGF-  and preventing release of active TGF- .","Published: May 1, 2015"

SkQ1 is a small molecule engineered specifically for reducing oxidative stress inside mitochondria, which proved to be effective in a topical ophthalmic formulation for treatment of dry eye syndrome. ""SkQ1 is the first mitochondria-targeted antioxidant to reach clinical phase of development for an ophthalmic indication , said Natalia Perekhvatova, Chief Executive Officer of Mitotech S.A..  We achieved statistically significant treatment effects in both signs and symptoms of dry eye syndrome. These findings are especially encouraging since they were obtained in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population in a small number of patients (30 patients per treatment arm). Results of this U.S. study are very valuable because they confirmed SkQ1 efficacy for the same dry eye signs and symptoms that our previous clinical study conducted in Russia and Ukraine already succeeded on. Ophthalmic formulation of SkQ1 called Visomitin has already been on the Russian pharmaceutical market since 2012 and this U.S. Phase II study is an important milestone for Mitotech S.A. in its path to other markets. Dry eye syndrome is a growing and hugely underserved indication and our company is now well-positioned for delivering a break-through product in this therapeutic area.  The 90-patient study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02121301) used Ora s Controlled Adverse Environment (CAE) chamber to measure dry eye patients' ability to withstand a stressful environment on the eye. This study was performed at a single investigational site in Andover, MA over a 2-month period from first patient to last patient visit. SkQ1 demonstrated superiority over placebo in several endpoints such as central (p = 0.036) and total corneal (p = 0.045) fluorescein staining pre to post CAE and grittiness (p = 0.058) pre to post CAE at week 4 in the ITT population.  The unique mechanism-of-action of reducing oxidative stress inside mitochondria in conjunction with these study results suggest that SkQ1 provides a significant protective benefit for dry eye patients  said George Ousler, Vice President of Dry Eye at Ora, Inc..

(Intercept) has announced the availability of additional post-hoc analyses from the Phase 2b FLINT trial of obeticholic acid (OCA) in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) at the International Liver Congress 2015, the 50th Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), being held in Vienna, Austria, from April 22-26, 2015. The poster entitled  Obeticholic Acid for NASH: Benefits in a High-Risk Subgroup and the Effects of Concomitant Stain Use  (late-breaker ePoster LP18) is currently available for viewing and will be presented in Room A-09 at 3:30 p.m. CET on Saturday April 25, 2015. The senior authors include Dr. Brent Neuschwander-Tetri, of St Louis University and Dr. Arun Sanyal, former President of the American Association of the Study of Liver Disease, from the NASH Clinical Research Network that conducted the trial. Advanced liver fibrosis is currently the best predictor of liver-related mortality in patients with NASH, while patients with early disease and concomitant risk factors such as diabetes, obesity or elevated ALT are also at risk of rapid progression to cirrhosis. The efficacy of OCA was evaluated in a high-risk subgroup of NASH patients in the FLINT trial considered more likely to experience liver-related clinical outcomes, defined as patients with a NAFLD activity score (NAS) of at least 4 and either (i) advanced fibrosis (stage 2 or 3), or (ii) early fibrosis (stage 1) together with concomitant diabetes, obesity or elevated ALT. Approximately 80% of the FLINT patients met these high-risk criteria. In this post-hoc analysis of the high-risk subgroup after 72 weeks of treatment (n=160; OCA=84; placebo=76), a significant percentage of OCA-treated patients experienced complete resolution of their fibrosis (15% OCA vs. 4% placebo, p=0.006). Improvements in fibrosis resolution were observed in OCA-treated patients across all baseline fibrosis stages (stage 1: 31% OCA vs. 11% placebo, stage 2: 16% OCA vs. 3% placebo, stage 3: 3% OCA vs. 0% placebo). Additionally, OCA treatment prevented progression to cirrhosis (2% OCA vs. 7% placebo), but this finding did not achieve statistical significance in this small number of patients. Improvements in cirrhosis prevention were also observed in patients with stage 3 bridging fibrosis (6% OCA vs. 14% placebo) and stage 2 fibrosis (0% OCA vs. 3% placebo). The results reported build on previously reported data from post-hoc analyses showing that OCA-treated patients experienced significant improvements in key histologic features of steatohepatitis, including NAS reduction by at least two points (60% OCA vs. 30% placebo, p=0.0004), NASH resolution (18% OCA vs. 5% placebo, p=0.014), and liver fibrosis improvement by at least one stage (39% OCA vs. 21% placebo, p=0.007). These histologic benefits were observed in OCA-treated patients in all subgroups and regardless of baseline fibrosis stage. The impact of statin use on LDL cholesterol was also evaluated in the FLINT trial population (n=283). In this post-hoc analysis, OCA-treated patients who initiated statins during the FLINT trial (n=26) experienced a rapid reversal of their observed mean LDL increase to below baseline levels, with a mean decrease after 72 weeks of treatment of -18.9 mg/dL. In contrast, other OCA-treated patients with no reported initiation or change in statin therapy experienced an increase in LDL that peaked at week 12 and was sustained over the 72 week treatment period. Patients treated with statins at baseline who maintained statin treatment over the duration of the study (n=50) experienced a mean LDL increase of 8.7 mg/dL at 72 weeks. Patients not treated with statins during the study (n=65) experienced a mean LDL increase of 16.0 mg/dL. Treatment related LDL increases in all groups reversed with treatment discontinuation. This post-hoc analysis suggests that the OCA associated LDL increase appears to reach a maximum peak and plateaus soon after initiation of therapy and that concomitant statin use in NASH patients receiving OCA may ameliorate any treatment-related LDL increases.  These data add to our understanding of the potential for OCA treatment to reverse fibrosis and prevent progression to cirrhosis, a pharmacologic benefit not previously confirmed in NASH patients,  said Dr. Brent Neuschwander-Tetri, the principal investigator of the trial.  Furthermore, the data support the potential for statins to effectively manage LDL in NASH patients, as currently recommended in the AASLD and EASL practice guidelines.  As previously reported in the primary analysis of FLINT, OCA was generally well tolerated. Adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and the incidence in the OCA and placebo treatment groups was similar for all symptoms except pruritus. Compared with placebo, pruritus in OCA-treated patients occurred more frequently (23% vs 6%, p<0.0001). Typically, the pruritus was of moderate intensity and resulted in one patient discontinuation. The incidence of severe or life threatening events was not different between the two treatment groups and most of the events in both groups were deemed to be unrelated to treatment, including all severe or life threatening cardiovascular events. Two deaths occurred in the OCA treatment group; neither was considered related to OCA treatment.","Published: May 1, 2015"

In a trial of over 1,000 patients, prednisolone and pentoxifylline, treatments recommended in international guidelines, did not achieve a statistically significant reduction in mortality after 28 days, 90 days or a year. The authors of the study, which is published in the New England Journal of Medicine, say there is an urgent need for more research into prevention and treatment of alcohol-related liver disease. Deaths from liver disease increased by 40 per cent in England and Wales from 2001 to 2012, partly driven by a rise in alcohol consumption. Alcoholic liver disease was responsible for 4,425 deaths in 2012. Excessive alcohol consumption first causes fat to build up in the liver, which is potentially reversible. Alcoholic hepatitis is a dramatic manifestation of alcohol-related liver disease, associated with jaundice and liver failure. It is caused by inflammation of the liver and may cause death in up to 30 per cent of patients with a month. Professor Mark Thursz from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, who led the study, said: ""Liver disease is the only major cause of preventable death that is increasing in England, but generally falling in other comparable European nations. ""The treatments we looked at are widely used, but the evidence supporting them comes from a few relatively small trials. This study is four times larger than any previous trial in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, so it provides much stronger data on how effective the drugs are. ""We were surprised to find that neither treatment had a significant effect on survival after the first month, and the mortality rate after one year is alarmingly high. We urgently need to invest in research into the mechanisms of disease, to identify targets for new treatments, and develop better strategies to stop people drinking."" The study involved 1,053 patients being treated at 65 hospitals in the UK. Patients were randomly assigned to four groups, each receiving two treatments: prednisolone and pentoxifylline, prednisolone and placebo, pentoxifylline and placebo, or both placebo. Overall, 16 per cent of patients died within 28 days of starting treatment. At 90 days, 29 per cent of patients had died, and after one year 56 per cent had either died or had a liver transplant. The differences in mortality rates between the treatment groups were not statistically significant. Professor Thursz said: ""One reason why we might not have seen a significant effect is that the drugs increase the risk of infection. Another reason is that many patients return to drinking, and suffer further attacks or complications of cirrhosis. ""Some older studies found a mortality rate after 28 days above 30 per cent. It was much lower in this study, which suggests that even though the treatments are ineffective, we are looking after patients better than we used to.""","Published: May 1, 2015"

The drugs interact with receptors on brain cells to tamp down the body s pain response. But now, neuroscientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have found a way to activate opioid receptors with light. In a test tube, the scientists melded the light-sensing protein rhodopsin to key parts of opioid receptors to activate receptor pathways using light. They also influenced the behavior of mice by injecting the receptors into the brain, using light instead of drugs to stimulate a reward response.Their findings are published online in the journal Neuron. The eventual hope is to develop ways to use light to relieve pain, a line of discovery that also could lead to better pain-killing drugs with fewer side effects.  It s conceivable that with much more research we could develop ways to use light to relieve pain without a patient needing to take a pain-killing drug with side effects,  said first author Edward R. Siuda, a graduate student in the laboratory of Michael R. Bruchas, PhD, an assistant professor of anesthesiology and of neurobiology. But before that s possible, the researchers are attempting to learn the most effective ways to activate and deactivate the opioid receptor s pathways in brain cells. Bruchas, the study s principal investigator, explained that working with light rather than pain-killing drugs makes it much easier to understand how the receptors function within the complex array of cells and circuits in the brain and spinal cord.  It s been difficult to determine exactly how opioid receptors work because they have multiple functions in the body,  Bruchas explained.  These receptors interact with pain-killing drugs called opiates, but they also are involved in breathing, are found in the gastrointestinal tract and play a role in the reward response.  So the researchers sought a way to limit opioid receptors to performing a single task at a time, and it turned out to be almost as easy as flipping on a light switch, according to Bruchas, Siuda and their collaborators, including co-first author Bryan A. Copits, PhD, a postdoctoral research scholar in the laboratory of Robert W. Gereau, IV, PhD, the Dr. Seymour and Rose T. Brown Professor of Anesthesiology. By combining the rhodopsin protein, which senses light in the eye s retina, with a specific type of opioid receptor called a Mu opioid receptor, the researchers were able to build a receptor that responds to light in exactly the same way that standard opioid receptors respond to pain-killing drugs. When an opioid receptor is exposed to a pain-killing drug, it initiates activity in specific chemical pathways in the brain and spinal cord. And when the researchers shone light on the receptors that contained rhodopsin, the same cellular pathways were activated. In a test tube and in cells, Siuda exposed the receptors to light and then watched as they released the same chemicals that standard opioid receptors release. Then, in mice, the researchers implanted a light-emitting diode (LED) device the size of a human hair into a brain region linked to the reward response. They injected the light-sensing receptors they had genetically manufactured into the same brain region. Neurons in that part of the brain release chemicals such as dopamine that create feelings of euphoria. In decades of past opioid studies, researchers have observed mice and rats to press a lever to receive a dose of morphine, for example. The morphine would activate opioid receptors and the release of dopamine, and the animals would enjoy the response and press the lever again to continue feeling that reward sensation. This is one of the reasons opiates are so often abused in patients being treated for pain   people like the way the drugs make them feel as much as the pain relief  they provide   and rates of abuse have skyrocketed over the past ten years. Working to deliver a similar reward sensation using light, the researchers put the mice into an enclosed chamber. In one part of the chamber, the lighted laser fiber-optic device stimulated the release of dopamine in the brain. When the animals left that part of the chamber, the light in the brain turned off. Soon after, the mice returned to the part of the chamber that activated the fiber-optic device so that the brain could receive more light stimulation.  By activating the receptors with light, we are presumably causing the brain to release more dopamine,  Bruchas explained.  Rather than a drug such as morphine activating an opioid receptor, the light provides the reward.  The researchers were able to vary the animals  response depending on the amount and type of light emitted by the LED. Different colors of light, longer and shorter exposure to light, and whether the light pulsed or was constant all produced slightly different effects. When a person takes an opioid drug such as Vicodin or OxyContin to relieve pain, such drugs interact with receptors in the brain to blunt pain sensations. But over time, patients develop tolerance and sometimes addiction. Opioids also can dramatically slow a person s breathing, too, and typically cause constipation. In theory, receptors tuned to light may not present the same danger. Siuda said it someday may be possible to activate, or deactivate, nerve cells without affecting any of the other receptors that pain-killing drugs trigger, although achieving that goal will be difficult. Bruchas  team is planning future studies that will use these receptors to test ways to control the brain cells that mediate pain and reward behavior with light rather than drugs.

The study, published in Neuron, demonstrates how advances in live-imaging techniques are revealing new insights into the body s ability to respond to spinal cord injuries. While the body of a neuron is small, its axon can extend far up or down the spinal cord, which is about one and half feet long in humans. Along that distance, the axon branches out to make hundreds of connections with other cells, sending out signals that allow us to sense and respond to the world around us. Unless something happens to disrupt the axon s reach, that is. Adult human axons in the brain and spinal cord are very limited in their ability to regenerate after injury   a hurdle that many researchers are trying to overcome in the treatment of spinal cord injuries and neurodegenerative diseases of the brain. In this study, senior author Binhai Zheng, PhD, associate professor of neurosciences, first author Ariana O. Lorenzana, PhD, and colleagues used a sophisticated optical imaging technique that allows them to directly visualize the spinal cord in living mouse models. With this approach, the researchers were able to systematically examine the effects of axon injury location on degeneration and regeneration of the injured branch. The injury locations they compared were just before an axon s major branch point (where a single axon branches into two) and just after it. The injuries just after the branch point cut off one branch, leaving the other intact, or cut both branches. The researchers found that injury to the main axon, before a branch point, resulted in regeneration in 89 percent of the cases. Axons with both branches cut after a branch point regenerated in 67 percent of cases. Regeneration occurred in the form of axon elongation, branching or both for at least five days after injury. In contrast, regeneration occurred only 12 percent of cases following cuts to just one of two axon branches after a major branch point. In this case, the injured branch trims itself all the way back to the base, preserving the function of the other, uninjured branch.  What we think is happening is that if an axon is injured in such a way that it still has some kind of connection, is still transmitting signals, the neuron can justify stabilization, but not the energy it would take to either regenerate axon length or just kill the whole thing off,  Zheng said.  On the other hand, once both branches of an axon are cut and there s no longer any connection or output, the neuron can justify the energy and resources to regenerate, even though that effort is largely futile in the central nervous system of an adult mammal.  This is a new, yet very fundamental, understanding of neuron behavior   one that will be important to keep in mind as new therapeutic approaches are proposed for spinal cord injuries, the researchers say.

The findings, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, (JAMA) could in future lead to those patients who are at risk of severe disease being identified early, and also predict who will respond best to treatment. Data from three independent multi-centre prospective cohort studies were used in the analysis, including a total of nearly 4,000 patients in total. It was found that the amino acid valine at position 11 of the HLA-DRB1 gene was the strongest independent genetic determinant of radiological damage in rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, it was revealed that positions 71 and 74 represented independent predictors, with the three positions together - 11, 71 and 74 - strongly associated with disease outcomes. Scientists have long suspected that different genotypes affect arthritis progression in a number of ways, given the condition's variable occurrence rate among different ethnic groups. The new research also revealed that HLA-DRB1 haplotypes associated with rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility and severe outcomes were also predictors of good treatment response with anti-TNF therapy, an important class of biological drugs pioneered and developed by Arthritis Research UK. Lead author Dr Sebastien Viatte, of the Arthritis Research UK Centre for Genetics and Genomics at The University of Manchester, said: ""This major advance in genetics might allow stratification of rheumatoid arthritis patients at the onset of their disease to identify those at risk of joint damage and early death, and also those who are more likely to respond to anti-TNF biological therapy."" Dr Stephen Simpson, director of research at Arthritis Research UK said:  To treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis more effectively and to prevent them being given drugs which won t work for them, it s important to know who is most likely to respond best to which drug, when and at what dose.

The bees are therefore now bred on a large scale and used as pollinators for economically valuable crops. Yet, these cute little, buzzing creatures, of which there are around 250 different species worldwide, is doing poorly in some places. The large shadow cast by the honeybee collapse has distracted from the fact that in recent years in the US as well as in other areas some previously common bumblebee species have also become rare or endangered, or disappeared altogether.Scientists decoded the entire genetic code of the bumblebee. (Graphics: ETH Zurich) For this reason, two former ETH researchers, Seth Barribeau and Ben Sadd, together with Professor Paul Schmid-Hempel from the group for experimental ecology, started a bumblebee genome project eight years ago. The objective of the project was to analyse the genomes of two commercially important species: the European Buff-tailed Bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, and its American counterpart, the Common Eastern Bumblebee Bombus impatiens. The researchers were hoping that the genomic data would shed light on the biology, ecology and evolution of the bumblebee more generally. Immune genes analysed Barribeau, Sadd and 80 other researchers from around the world paid particular attention to the genes of the immune system. Evolutionary biologists, ecologists, bioinformaticians, and geneticists were involved in the project. The researchers also compared the genomes of the two bumblebee species with genomes of other insects that had already been mapped, such as the honeybee, the parasitoid wasp Nasonia and fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The scientists recently published their findings in the scientific journal Genome Biology. The genomes of the two bumblebee species strongly resemble each other and contain about 20,000 different genes on 18 chromosomes. The scientists discovered that only a small fraction of these are genes involved in the immune response. In fact, the genetic repertoire of the immune system in the two bumblebee species has only about 150 genes, a relatively small portion compared with flies or mosquitoes   Drosophila has twice as many. The honeybee and parasitoid wasp (Nasonia), on the other hand, have only a small immunogenetic repertoire, too. Social organisation plays little role in immunity Schmid-Hempel is puzzled that the bumblebee, which exhibits relatively weak social organisation, has just as few immune genes as the honeybee, with its complex social organisation. He says that until now researchers had assumed that insects with a high degree of social organisation could afford to invest less in their immune system. In turn, a simple social system would promote a stronger individual defence. This previous theory suggested that highly social insects had other ways to ward off pathogens than to rely solely on their individual immune defences   for example, defence cooperation such as mutual body care. Schmid-Hempel thinks that the weak immune system of the honeybee and bumblebee could be related to their diet: flies and fruit flies such as Drosophila melanogaster eat from surfaces such as rotten fruit, which are contaminated with bacteria and fungus, whereas bees eat from relatively clean food sources, such as plant  pollen and nectar. This should reduce the risk of infection and thus the selective pressure for a well-developed immune system. But it is more than just a weak immune system that has been making the lives of bumblebees (and honeybees) difficult lately. The researchers were able to identify only very few genes that regulate the body s mechanism for detoxification. According to Schmid-Hempel, this would at least be in line with the worry that these insects are sensitive to environmental toxins, such as agricultural pesticides. Genetic differences shed light on ecology The genetic analysis has, however, also revealed significant differences between the honeybee and bumblebee. For example, the bumblebee has more genes that contribute to taste, whereas the honeybee has more that contribute to the sense of smell. This makes sense as the bumblebee relies on its sense of taste to find food, testing with its tongue virtually every flower. In contrast, the honeybee relies more on odours  to find the right food, as it plays a role in the waggle dance, which honeybees use to communicate the presence of a good food source to each other.  This fundamental difference in the way these two bees live is clearly reflected in their genes,  explains Schmid-Hempel. No social gene The researchers were surprised to find that they were able to associate relatively few specific genes to social organisation and behaviour.  The genes for this don t differ very much between bumblebees and honeybees,  says Schmid-Hempel. But the scientists did discover different sets of micro-RNAs, tiny snippets of ribonucleic acids, in these insects. These miRNAs regulate genes by blocking gene copies, which serve as blueprints for proteins in the cells. It is specifically this type of gene regulation that seemingly takes a  normal , primitively social insect, such as the bumblebee, and transforms it into a highly social organism like the honeybee.","Published: April 30, 2015"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/id1-gene-interferes-with-immune-system-197531,Id  Gene Interferes With Immune System Uncovering new functions of a gene implicated in cancer growth opens new therapeutic possibilities  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Weill Cornell Medical College researchers have shown for the first time that a gene previously implicated in blood vessel formation during embryonic development and tumor growth also induces immune suppression during tumor development. This finding, published April 29 in Nature Communications, opens the door for new therapeutic approaches and vaccine development in treating patients with melanoma and other advanced-staged cancers. Two decades ago, researchers discovered that a gene called Inhibitor of Differentiation 1 (Id1), which is normally found in the embryo, was also present in cancer patients and contributing to tumor progression. The present study reveals another way that Id1 works, hijacking a normal pathway in immune cell development and interfering with the entire immune system, starting in the bone marrow. Without competent immune cells, the body can't fight off tumors, and instead, cancer is allowed to grow, spread and thrive.""Targeting Id1 offers the potential to restore overall immune function,"" said senior author Dr. David Lyden, the Stavros S. Niarchos Professor in Pediatric Cardiology and a professor of pediatrics in the Department of Pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medical College. ""When the immune system is functioning, treatment options are more plentiful. Given the increased incidence and death rates tied to advanced stage metastatic cancers, there is also an increased urgency to understand how pro-metastatic, immunosuppressive mechanisms, like those driven by Id1, work."" The investigators discovered that a tumor-secreted protein called transforming growth factor beta ( GF ) promotes the activation of Id1. The gene then sets off a chain reaction that redirects immune cells down a new pathway that churns out immature suppressor cells, extinguishing the immune system's ability to mount an effective defense and allowing cancer to grow and spread unabated. ""Normally, the bone marrow produces, among other immune cell types, dendritic cells, which are capable of stopping the spread and growth of tumors,"" said first author Dr. Marianna Papaspyridonos, who was a Fulbright Cancer Research Fellow at Cornell University in Dr. Lyden's lab. ""But when TGF  is released by the tumor and Id1 is upregulated, the normal generation of dendritic cells is interrupted, and instead another subset of immune cells, which suppresses the immune system, is formed."" Those immune cells, called myeloid-derived suppressor cells, allow cancer to more readily grow and spread. The researchers validated this finding in advanced melanoma patients, who have increased TGF  plasma levels and higher levels of Id1 in myeloid peripheral blood cells. Targeting Id1 might provide a three-pronged therapeutic approach, which would first reduce the metastatic potential of the tumor itself, then reduce the tumor's ability to form new blood vessels, a process called vasculogenesis, and finally restore the patient's systemic immune function. ""With this approach, immune cells will recognize a tumor as foreign and attack it,"" said Dr. Lyden, who also has appointments in the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center and the Gale and Ira Drukier Institute for Children's Health at Weill Cornell. ""This will improve vaccine development, lead to better treatment outcomes and ultimately benefit cancer patients.""","Published: April 30, 2015"

Processing large amounts of sequencing data remains a challenge, especially for individual research and clinical labs, in terms of the computing resources and bioinformatics expertise required. The DRAGEN processor provides a promising solution for quickly analyzing the data,  said Wenzhong Xiao, Ph.D., Director of the Immuno-Metabolic Computing Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, and leader of a Computational Genomics Lab at the Stanford Genome Technology Center. Added Pieter van Rooyen, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Edico Genome,  Deepening the coverage of a whole genome sequence from the standard 30x to 300x greatly increases the accuracy and reliability of results, which is increasingly important with the rise of precision medicine and the use of targeted therapies for cancer. However, until now analysis tools have not been able to process the associated tenfold increase in processing power and subsequent storage space required. This study shows that DRAGEN removes the otherwise prohibitive time and potentially cost barriers, enabling 300x depth of coverage to be feasibly achieved, which could ultimately lead to improved patient care.  In the study, the highly curated genome NA12878 with 300x depth of coverage was reanalyzed using DRAGEN. The speed and pipeline accuracy of the reanalysis was compared to a reference analysis with BWA/GATK software. Results using DRAGEN were obtained in six hours and 16 minutes, while results using BWA/GATK software were obtained in 60 hours and 28 minutes. In addition, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed the analysis with DRAGEN was comparable to the reference analysis with BWA/GATK software for both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and insertions or deletions (INDELs). The benchmark genotype calls of NA12878 were developed by the Genome in a Bottle Consortium, an initiative led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  We continue our collaboration with Edico to evaluate the DRAGEN pipeline of sequence analysis for a number of different applications in clinical genomics,  said Dr. Xiao.  So far we see about tenfold reduction of processing time without a noticeable loss of sensitivity and specificity.  DRAGEN  is a reconfigurable platform designed to massively accelerate secondary analysis of NGS, removing a key bottleneck in NGS workflow. DRAGEN is loaded with highly optimized algorithms for mapping, alignment, sorting and variant calling, and the flexible platform can be loaded with additional algorithms for a range of secondary analysis pipelines, such as whole genome or exome, RNAseq, methylome, microbiome and cancer. The solution can be integrated directly into NGS bioinformatics servers and sequencing instruments and is provided with accompanying software as a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).

The new study, led by Imperial College London, shows that obesity has a 'metabolic signature' detectable in urine samples, pointing to processes that could be targeted to mitigate its effects on health. The findings are published in Science Translational Medicine. Urine contains a variety of chemicals known as metabolites, from a vast range of biochemical processes in the body. Technologies that analyse the metabolic makeup of a sample can therefore offer huge amounts of information that reflects both a person's genetic makeup and lifestyle factors. The Imperial researchers analysed urine samples from over 2,000 volunteers in the US and the UK. They found 29 different metabolic products whose levels correlated with the person's body mass index, and how they fit together in a complex network that links many different parts of the body. Some of these metabolites are produced by bacteria that live in the gut, highlighting the potentially important role these organisms play in obesity. Altered patterns of energy-related metabolites produced in the muscles were also identified as being linked to obesity. Professor Jeremy Nicholson, Director of the MRC-NIHR National Phenome Centre at Imperial College London and a senior author of the study said: ""Obesity has become a huge problem all over the world, threatening to overwhelm health services and drive life expectancy gains into reverse. Tackling it is an urgent priority and it requires us to have a much better understanding of how body fat and other aspects of biology are related. These findings provide possible starting points for new approaches to preventing and treating obesity and its associated diseases."" Professor Paul Elliott, Head of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Imperial, said: ""Our results point to patterns of metabolic markers in the urine associated with obesity. It may be possible to identify non-obese people who have such patterns in their urine profile. These people could be at risk of developing obesity and metabolic diseases, and might benefit from personalised preventative interventions."" The National Phenome Centre is funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).

The Banting Medal recognizes significant, long-term contributions to the understanding, treatment, or prevention of diabetes. Dr. Scherer, who holds the Gifford O. Touchstone, Jr. and Randolph G. Touchstone Distinguished Chair in Diabetes Research, will officially accept the award when he presents a lecture on June 7 at the ADA s 75th Scientific Sessions in Boston. His research focuses on the physiology of energy-storing fat cells called adipocytes.  I am extremely excited about receiving the Banting Medal. Our research over the last 10 years examined the pathophysiology of fat tissue in diabetes and obesity and was done with a highly integrated group of UT Southwestern researchers, including talented junior faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, and students,  said Dr. Scherer, Professor of Internal Medicine. Dr. Scherer is known for his discovery of adiponectin, a hormone produced by fat, and for defining its physiologic roles. Adipose tissue previously had been considered simply as a storage depot for triglycerides, but Dr. Scherer s studies using cell biological and biochemical approaches, as well as mouse genetics, revealed that adipose tissue is in fact a highly responsive endocrine organ that plays a crucial role in metabolism and inflammation. His seminal work has demonstrated an initially protective role for obesity, keeping excess lipid in adipocytes and out of nonadipocyte tissues such as liver and muscle, which are not designed to store fat. His innovative contributions have been described in more than 320 publications, some of which have been cited more than 1,000 times, and comprise a comprehensive characterization of adipose tissue physiology.  These discoveries, combined with innovative methods he developed to study contributions of specific cells to regulation of metabolism, have defined Dr. Scherer as one of the most noteworthy and creative scientists in the field,  noted the ADA in announcing the award, given in memory of Sir Frederick Banting, a medical scientist, doctor, and Nobel laureate who is noted as one of the key investigators in the discovery of insulin, a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. Dr. Scherer is the fourth UT Southwestern faculty member to receive this honor. Earlier Banting Medals were awarded to the late Dr. J.

The results could help scientists design new drugs that better control blood pressure while limiting side effects. The research focused on a type of drug known as an ARB, or angiotensin receptor blocker. Used by millions of people each year, ARBs are designed to block a receptor in cell membranes so it cannot bind with angiotensin II, a hormone that induces the constriction of blood vessels, causing an increase in blood pressure.  Many ARBs have been developed, but the interaction between the drug and the receptor has been unknown at the atomic level,  said Vadim Cherezov, a chemistry professor at the University of Southern California who led the experiment at SLAC s Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray laser, a DOE Office of Science User Facility.  Now we have determined the structure of the joined ARB and receptor in atomic detail, and we have shown that all of the previous molecular models - the best guesses for how they fit together - were wrong in many important details,  Cherezov said.  These results can be used to design other types of compounds and predict how they will bind to the receptors.  The results are detailed in the April 23 issue of Cell. Fighting a  Silent Killer  About three in 10 U.S. adults suffer from hypertension, or high blood pressure, and about 75 percent of them take prescribed medication to treat it. Hypertension is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, the leading causes of death in the U.S., and it is known as a  silent killer  because there may be no outward symptoms.  Everybody would like to find the agent or mechanism to more actively and efficiently control blood pressure,  said Dr. Stanley G. Rockson, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Stanford School of Medicine.  If we can understand the molecular mechanisms better, and come up with a targeted drug that s more effective, we can streamline therapy.  ARBs are a multibillion-dollar industry, with fewer side effects than some other hypertension medications. But because their effectiveness at higher doses may be limited, they are often used in combination with other drugs, complicating treatment when patients fail to follow the complete regimen, Rockson said. The development of a single, more effective drug would help. A Brighter Way to Study Challenging Samples In the SLAC experiment researchers studied nanoscale crystals that contained many copies of an experimental ARB coupled to receptors. The crystals were grown in a toothpaste-like material that mimics their fatty surroundings in cell membranes. A specialized nozzle oozed a thin stream of the crystal-containing paste into the LCLS X-ray pulses, producing patterns that were used to solve the 3-D structure of the combined drug and receptor. This technique and the unique LCLS X-ray pulses give scientists powerful new tools to study delicate, challenging samples such as medically important proteins. LCLS produces X-rays a billion times brighter than conventional light sources. Researchers from SLAC s Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), another DOE Office of Science User Facility, aided in the data analysis and 3-D mapping work. Cherezov said his research team plans to study the same receptor in combination with other drug compounds to fill in more details about its signaling mechanisms.  We would like to look at different compounds with the receptor to see the picture more completely,  Cherezov said.  With this information you can accelerate the design of new drugs.

While many examples exist of such synergistic effects, very few studies have identified the neural architecture underlying multisensory convergence. In particular, whether distinct sensory streams converge early, late or at multiple levels in the sensory processing hierarchy was an open question. Using behavioral testing, neuronal activation screens, and electron microscopy reconstructions of the nervous system of fruit fly larvae, scientists at Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Research Campus have mapped the entire neural circuit involved in combining vibration and pain sensations used in triggering an escape behavior. The researchers discovered that the two sensory streams converge at multiple layers of the sensory processing hierarchy. This multilevel convergence likely facilitates discrimination between different kinds of multisensory events. The results were reported online in Nature. ""Initially I would have thought this circuit would be simpler, but the complex network could really allow the animal to do a complex computation and react to very particular combinations of cues,"" says Janelia group leader Marta Zlatic, a neurobiologist and one of the leaders of the research team. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, exhibits an array of distinct escape behaviors, such as turning, digging, fast crawling and rolling -- a response to threatening situations, including predator attacks that elicit both mechanosensory, or vibratory, and nociceptive, or painful, sensations. While mechanosensory and nociceptive neurons had previously been identified, the interneurons onto which the two sensory streams converge, and the command neurons that actually initiate the rolling response, were not known. To map out this circuit, the research teams of Zlatic and Albert Cardona used a three-pronged approach that incorporated iterative rounds of behavioral testing, genetic screens to identify neurons involved in the rolling behavior, and the reconstruction of neural circuits from electron microscopy images of ultrathin sections of larval brain tissue. First, to trigger rolling, the researchers used speaker-emitted vibrations and the activation of nociceptive neurons that simulated, respectively, the mechanosensory and nociceptive aspects of a predator attack. The effect of combining these two sensory cues was highly synergistic with combinations of cues triggering rolling with much greater probability than either cue alone. Next, Tomoko Ohyama, the co-first author on the study, performed a screen of hundreds of transgenic mutants -- each of which expresses in a distinct subset of neurons -- created by group leaders Gerry Rubin, Jim Truman and Janelia's Fly Light Project team. Ohyama identified neurons that when stimulated triggered rolling and appeared to innervate the early sensory processing centers in the nerve cord. In parallel, in a series of electron microscopic images that spanned one segment of the nerve cord, Casey Schneider-Mizell and Cardona reconstructed all the interneurons directly downstream of the mechanosensory and nociceptive sensory axons, using a novel open source computer-assisted circuit mapping method developed by the Cardona lab. This revealed that two types (out of several hundred) first-order interneurons received multiple synaptic connections from both sensory modalities, whereas others mostly received inputs from a single modality. The roll-evoking neurons identified in Ohyama's screen turned out to be the ones targeted by both the mechanosensory and nociceptive axons. Physiological studies confirmed these first-order interneurons integrate information from the two modalities, responding more to the combination of cues than to either cue alone. Stimulating first-order mechanosensory interneurons in combination with the identified first-order multisensory interneurons led to an increased likelihood of rolling, indicating that their outputs were combined by interneurons in one or more higher processing layers. The transgenic screen also identified command neurons -- dubbed ""Goro"" for the Japanese word for rolling -- that were activated by stimulating the first-order multisensory interneurons and ultimately triggered the rolling behavior. Finally, Schneider-Mizell mapped out the pathways between the first-order interneurons and the Goro command neurons from a second series of more than 5,000 electron microscopic sections of an entire larval nervous system collected by co-author Rick Fetter and Janelia's Fly EM Project and registered by Cardona. The circuit reconstruction revealed a complex multilevel, multimodal feedforward convergence architecture as well as multiple local and higher-order feedback motifs. Both nerve cord and brain pathways to Goro were present with multiple layers of interneurons in each pathway. Distinct types of second-order interneurons combine information from multisensory and unisensory first-order interneurons across multiple segments and ascend to the brain. The second-order interneurons, which received distinct combinations of first-order interneuron inputs -- and therefore distinct combinations of mechanosensory and nociceptive inputs -- re-converged again on third-order interneurons in the brain. These third-order interneurons synapse onto neurons that project descending inputs to the command neurons. In a separate pathway, multisensory and mechanosensory first-order interneurons were connected to command neurons through a set of two interneurons in the nerve cord, bypassing the brain altogether. This pathway was sufficient to activate the command neurons even when the brain was removed. However, the brain pathway likely integrates information across all body segments and modulates command neuron activity based on body-wide sensory information. ""It was pretty surprising that sensory modalities would merge again and again at so many different levels,"" says Zlatic. ""But in a way it makes sense because that enables the network to tune itself to respond to particular combination of two cues. For example, to a particular combination of noxious and mechanical cues presented by predators. The weights in this network could be tuned either through experience or through evolution -- a fascinating question for the future."" Zlatic added that the multilevel, multisensory convergence architecture her team observed in the Drosophila larvae may be a general feature in multisensory circuits, enabling complex responses tunable to specific ecological needs. This multisensory circuit in a genetically tractable model system provides a basis for detailed investigation of structural circuit motifs that implement multisensory computations. The Cardona lab has made the electron microscopic volume of the entire larval nervous system available for studying other circuits in the Drosophila larval nervous system. ""We've invited the entire community and said, 'Anyone interested in specific aspects of the nervous system can come and join the Cardona lab in the tracing efforts,'"" Zlatic says. ""If many people reconstruct different circuits of interest, we will soon complete a connectome of an insect nervous system and the whole effort will be synergistic.""

Those who treat brain-injured patients rarely make use of new scientific discoveries about the workings of the brain. Instead, doctors, nurses and emergency personnel rely on a decades-old tool, the Glasgow coma scale, to categorize brain injuries as mild, moderate or severe. Brain scans are sometimes performed to help identify damaged regions, and then most patients receive one or more of the following four diagnoses: coma (no response to sensory stimulation), delirium (impaired ability to sustain attention), amnesia (impaired memory) and dysexecutive syndrome (impaired ability to engage in goal-directed thought). These crude classifications reveal little about the underlying brain mechanisms that are damaged as a result of brain trauma, said Aron Barbey, a University of Illinois professor of neuroscience, of psychology, and of speech and hearing science. He and his colleagues propose that doctors take a deeper look at the brain networks that enable the regulation and control of attention, memory and thought -- termed ""cognitive control processes"" -- and use this knowledge to develop more targeted treatment strategies. Barbey is a professor in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology and in the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at the U. of I. ""Traumatic brain injury is a global public health epidemic with an incidence that continues to rise,"" Barbey said. ""By 2020, the World Health Organization projects TBI will be the world's leading cause of neurological disability across all age groups. ""An emerging area of research seeks to develop better ways to assess traumatic brain injury. Recent findings demonstrate that multiple, interdependent brain networks drive and organize cognition. It is these networks that are highly susceptible to brain injury,"" he said. Cognitive neuroscientists have identified dozens of brain networks, each of which engages a specific set of brain structures to perform particular tasks. Each node in a network communicates with the others via axons, the nerve fibers that bundle together to form white-matter tracts. ""There are three core networks that support cognitive control processes that often are impaired in traumatic brain injury,"" Barbey said. ""The 'salience network' directs attention to significant events in our environment and is known to enable coordinated behavior. The 'default mode network' supports an internal focus of attention, enabling autobiographical memory and the ability to envision future events. Finally, the 'central executive network' directs attention to the external environment and supports goal-directed thought, such as planning and problem solving."" Disruption of the salience network corresponds to symptoms seen in those diagnosed with delirium, Barbey said. A diagnosis of amnesia corresponds to disruption of the default mode network, and dysexecutive syndrome is associated with damage to the central executive network, he said. (See image.) A coma diagnosis reflects systemwide failure, Barbey said. Understanding which brain networks are damaged in brain-injured patients will help doctors better predict the kinds of impairments their patients will experience, and will guide clinical treatment and therapy. To that end, the researchers recommend therapies that have shown promise in strengthening specific cognitive control functions. Many methods that are familiar to cognitive neuroscience but little-used in patient therapy should be tested in patient populations, the researchers wrote. These include interventions that target specific brain networks, such as transcranial direct-current brain stimulation, and approaches that deliver global benefits to brain health, such as physical fitness training. Research indicates that brain stimulation can be applied to specific brain networks to enhance their ability to respond optimally to cognitive rehabilitation, Barbey said. Physical fitness is known to promote brain health and therefore may enhance resilience to brain injury, he said. ""The goal is to develop more precise assessment standards for traumatic brain injury and to translate discoveries from cognitive neuroscience into effective clinical therapies that promote recovery from brain injury,"" he said.

Research in the Journal of Marketing Research has shown that preconceived beliefs may create a placebo effect so strong that the actual chemistry of the brain changes. ""Studies have shown that people enjoy identical products such as wine or chocolate more if they have a higher price tag,"" write authors Hilke Plassmann (INSEAD) and Bernd Weber (University of Bonn). ""However, almost no research has examined the neural and psychological processes required for such marketing placebo effects to occur."" Participants in one of the studies were told they would consume five wines ($90, $45, $35, $10, $5) while their brains were scanned using an MRI. In reality, subjects consumed only three different wines with two different prices. Another experiment used labels to generate positive (""organic"") or negative (""light"") expectations of the pleasantness of a milkshake. Some consumed identical milkshakes but thought they would be either organic or regular; others consumed identical milkshakes but thought they would be either light or regular. Participants showed significant effect of price and taste prejudices, both in how they rated the taste as well as in their measurable brain activity. The MRI readings related in part to specific areas of the brain that differ from person to person. These differences are also associated with known differences in personality traits. The authors were able to further determine that people who were strong reward-seekers or who were low in physical self-awareness were also more susceptible to having their experience shaped by prejudices about the product. ""Understanding the underlying mechanisms of this placebo effect provides marketers with powerful tools. Marketing actions can change the very biological processes underlying a purchasing decision, making the effect very powerful indeed,"" the authors conclude.

After finding that two circuits showed opposite activity following fear and reward learning, the researchers proved that this divergent activity causes either avoidance or reward-driven behaviors. Funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), they used cutting-edge optical-genetic tools to pinpoint these mechanisms critical to survival, which are also implicated in mental illness.  This study exemplifies the power of new molecular tools that can push and pull on the same circuit to see what drives behavior,  explained Thomas R. Insel, M.D., director of NIH s National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).  Improved understanding of how such emotional memory works holds promise for solving mysteries of brain circuit disorders in which these mechanisms are disrupted.  NIMH grantee Kay Tye, Ph.D., Praneeth Namburi and Anna Beyeler, Ph.D., of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, and colleagues, report their findings in the journal Nature. Prior to the new study, scientists suspected involvement of the circuits ultimately implicated, but were stumped by a seeming paradox. A crossroads of convergent circuits in an emotion hub deep in the brain, the basolateral amygdala, seem to be involved in both fear and reward learning, but how one brain region could orchestrate such opposing behaviors   approach and avoidance   remained an enigma. How might signals find the appropriate path to follow at this fork in the road? To find out, Tye and colleagues explored whether two suspect circuit projections from the crossroads might hold clues. One projects to a reward center, the nucleus accumbens, and the other to a nearby fear center, the centromedial amygdala, the output station of the emotion hub. Each circuit projection is composed of separate populations of intertwined neurons. The researchers first used telltale fluorescent bead tracers to sort out which neurons belonged to each circuit. They then measured an indicator of connectivity   the strength of neural connections   in the projections, after mice underwent fear or reward learning. Animals were trained to either fear a tone paired with a shock or to associate the tone with a sugar reward. Strikingly, crossroads connectivity to reward center projections decreased after fear learning and increased with reward learning. By contrast, connectivity to fear center projections increased with fear learning and decreased after reward learning. These converging mechanisms in anatomically intertwined circuits could hold clues to teasing apart how positive and negative emotional associations may influence each other, Tye suggested. To prove a causal link between the projection-identified circuits and behavior, Tye s team turned to optogenetics, which enables light pulses to control brain circuitry in animals genetically engineered to be light-responsive. Optically stimulating the reward center projection enhanced positive reinforcement, while stimulating the fear center projection promoted negative reinforcement. Similarly, blocking the fear center projection impaired fear learning and enhanced reward learning. Finally, the researchers pinpointed defining electrophysiological, anatomic and genetic features of the two circuits that help to explain the opposite connectivity responses.  Given that many mental health problems, including anxiety, addiction, and depression, may arise from perturbations in emotional processing, these findings could help to pave the way to a circuit-based approach to treating mental illness,  said Tye.

New research published in The Journal of Neuroscience identifies a molecular mechanism in the reward center of the brain that influences how recovering cocaine addicts might relapse after stressful events. Importantly, the study identifies a potential mechanism for protecting against such relapses with treatment. The research team looked at the effects of cocaine in rat brain cells (in vitro) and in live rats -- particularly their 'cocaine seeking' response to stress. Lead researcher Dr Peter McCormick, from UEA's School of Pharmacy, said: ""Relapse among cocaine addicts is a major problem. We wanted to find out what causes it. ""Neuropeptides are messenger molecules that carry information between neurons in the brain. They form the brain's communications system. ""We looked at the interaction between two particular neuropeptides in the part of the brain that is to do with reward, motivation and drug addiction among other things. ""We had speculated that there might be a direct communication between neuroreceptors controlling stress and reward. When we tested this, we found this to indeed be the case. ""Our research showed that the release of neuropeptides influences activity in this part of the brain and that profound changes occur at the neuroreceptor level due to exposure to cocaine. ""We showed that cocaine disrupts the interaction between receptors and these changes could increase the risk of relapse under stressful conditions. ""Importantly, we identify a potential mechanism for protection against such relapse. ""By restoring the broken interaction, we may be able to minimize stress-driven relapse in addicts. This research lays the groundwork for the development of such approaches. ""Although our study is in rodents, the same receptors have been shown to impact human stress and drug addiction. ""Cocaine has a relatively unique effect on the brain. However, the reward center is crucial for addictive behaviours. ""Studies on post-traumatic stress disorder have shown traumatic events can have profound influences on receptors in this region of the brain, perhaps rendering soldiers more prone to addiction.

The findings, appearing in Nature Communications, challenge conventional wisdom about perineural invasion, which holds that cancer cells are marauders that invade nerves through the path of least resistance, said Nisha D'Silva, principal investigator and professor at the University of Michigan (U-M) School of Dentistry. D'Silva's lab discovered that perineural invasion is actually a much more intricately choreographed biochemical give-and-take between the nerves and the cancer cells. ""Once head and neck cancer invades the nerves, it is one of the worst things that can happen,"" said D'Silva, who also has a joint appointment at the U-M Medical School Department of Pathology and is a member of the U-M Cancer Center's Head and Neck Oncology program. ""It is highly correlated with poor patient survival, and there is no targeted treatment for it because it is not known why some tumors do this and some don't."" Perineural invasion is seen most in head and neck, pancreatic, stomach and colon cancers, and causes severe pain or numbness, tumor spread and recurrence, and loss of function, among other complications. D'Silva's lab found that perineural invasion begins when the nerve releases a stimulus that triggers a specific protein receptor in cancer cells. The receptor activates instructions in the cancer and releases the same stimulus back to the nerve. The nerve recognizes the stimulus, which causes the nerve to 'reach' toward the cancer imagine two dancers recognizing each other across a room and slowly moving closer until they become permanent partners. After this initial pairing up, the loop continues. ""Basically it's like they are waltzing,"" D'Silva said. ""It is a very elegant dance, if you will."" It is extremely difficult to study perineural invasion in head and neck cancer, so D'Silva's lab had to develop a way to observe these interactions in live samples. First, researchers implanted the nerve in chick egg membranes, and after the nerve integrated, they studied the interactions between the nerve and head and neck cancer cells. D'Silva said the next steps in the research are to find out, ""when and how we can interrupt the dance.""

The microneedle patch under development measures about a square centimeter and is administered with the press of a thumb. The underside of the patch is lined with 100 solid, conical microneedles made of polymer, sugar, and vaccine that are a fraction of a millimeter long. When the patch is applied, the microneedles press into the upper layers of the skin; they dissolve within a few minutes, releasing the vaccine. The patch can then be discarded.  Each day, 400 children are killed by measles complications worldwide. With no needles, syringes, sterile water or sharps disposals needed, the microneedle patch offers great hope of a new tool to reach the world s children faster, even in the most remote areas,  said James Goodson, Ph.D., epidemiologist from the CDC s Global Immunization Division.  This advancement would be a major boost in our efforts to eliminate this disease, with more vaccines administered and more lives saved at less cost.  Getting the measles vaccine to remote areas is expected to be easier because the patch is more stable at varying temperatures than the currently available vaccines and takes up less space than the standard vaccine. Because microneedles dissolve in the skin, there is no disposal of needles, reducing the risk of accidental needlesticks. The measles patch is expected be manufactured at a cost comparable to the currently available needle and syringe vaccine. Twenty million people are affected by measles each year. Unfortunately, global coverage with the measles vaccine has been stagnant for the last few years at around 85 percent, which is well below the coverage of up to 95 percent needed to interrupt transmission of the disease. Because measles is vaccine-preventable and the measles virus survives only in human hosts, the world s health officials are aiming for measles elimination. Having a simple patch administered by minimally trained vaccinators could help increase vaccination coverage and achieve the goal of measles elimination. Georgia Tech and CDC s Global Immunization Division and Division of Viral Diseases recently completed a study that showed the new microneedle patch produces a strong immune response in an animal model. No adverse effects or health issues were noted during the study. These findings have cleared the way for developing proposals for human clinical trials, which could begin as early as 2017.  We think this collaboration with CDC is an excellent example of how advances in engineering can be used to address important public health problems,  said Mark Prausnitz, a Regents Professor in the School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at Georgia Tech. Prausnitz served as one of the principal investigators on the study. World Immunization Week, celebrated in the last week of April each year, aims to promote the use of vaccines to protect people of all ages against disease. This year s campaign focuses on closing the immunization gap and reaching equity in immunization levels as outlined in the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP). The plan, endorsed by the 194 member states of the World Health Assembly in May 2012, is the framework to prevent millions of deaths by 2020 through universal access to vaccines for people in all communities. The GVAP aims to:Microneedle technology could move the GVAP forward by leading to improved protection against other diseases, including polio, influenza, rotavirus, rubella, tuberculosis and others. CDC is also collaborating with Georgia Tech to see if microneedles could be used to administer inactivated polio vaccine. Additional research is studying microneedle-administration of the influenza, rotavirus and tuberculosis vaccines.

The study, published in Nature Methods, has experimentally established for the first time that when a cell loses or gains a copy of a chromosome during cell division, the genes in that particular region of DNA show decreased or increased expression. While this has long been assumed by genetic researchers, it has not been seen before. The DNA code that makes up our genome can be found in every cell of our body. This is decoded into a group of molecules in our cells known as RNA, which provide instructions for that particular cell's proteins to perform their particular function. Transcriptome sequencing measures the amount of each RNA molecule in a cell and provides an insight into its function that cannot be gained by looking at the DNA. Scientists can now see a cell's DNA, including the mutational damage it has sustained on its journey from the fertilised egg, alongside the RNA of the same cell, which enacts all the DNA's instructions, even the errors. ""By looking at the genome and transcriptome in parallel in a single cell, we can begin to see what the functional consequences of genetic variations are,"" explains Professor Thierry Voet, a corresponding author from KU Leuven and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. ""This technology will enable us to probe for genetic heterogeneity in normal and diseased tissues deeper than ever before providing novel understanding of normal and disease development; for instance it will help us to better understand the diversity of cancer cells that arise within a tumour, and the difficulty of treating the disease."" G&T-seq is unique in the field as it allows high throughput DNA-and RNA-sequencing from single cells in parallel on a diverse range of sequencers, while previous methods were limited to the interrogation of either the DNA or the RNA of a cell, but not both. ""The potential to scale-up this method is one of the most exciting elements of this research,"" says Dr Iain Macaulay, first author and a corresponding author from the Sanger Institute. ""To meaningfully grasp the heterogeneity of cells in a tissue, we need to be able to look at genome and transcriptome data for hundreds or thousands of individual cells at a time. As the cost of sequencing continues to drop, these large-scale projects will become more feasible and we will begin to see, in unprecedented detail, the diversity and life-history of cells that form human tissue."" To test the method, researchers sequenced two different cell lines derived from the same person; one from breast cancer and one from normal blood cells. The results from the normal cells showed, as expected, that the vast majority had two copies of each chromosome. However, many of the cancer cells were missing or had gained pieces of chromosomes, and their transcriptomes were significantly different from the normal cells. The researchers also spotted a previously unobserved cancer-associated chromosomal fusion in the breast cancer cell line. After seeing abnormalities in the RNA data, the transcriptomes of three of the cells were further analysed using Pacific Biosciences long-read sequencing machines. These readings showed the complete sequence of a fusion transcript arising from the fusion of two genes on different chromosomes. Because the genomes of the same single cells were sequenced in parallel, the position where two different chromosomes had fused, generating this new transcript, could be detected. An unexpected result in the parallel sequence data of the normal blood cell line demonstrates the potential of this method to see detail that was previously invisible. While the data for most cells was similar, four cells were discovered to have three copies of chromosome 11 each; this was reflected in the RNA expression data, which peaks at chromosome 11. With traditional sequencing, these cells would go unnoticed but scientists are now equipped to ask what effect minute changes like these have on the cells. G&T-seq is currently being used to better understand early embryonic development. In this study, normal early-stage mouse embryos were compared with mouse embryos treated with a chemical that induces chromosomal missegregation. Once again, the method showed that when a cell gains or loses a chromosome, even after a single cell division, changes in gene expression dosage can immediately be seen. ""Using this method, we've been able to reveal cellular properties that cannot be seen by DNA or RNA sequencing alone,"" says Professor Chris Ponting, a corresponding author from the University of Oxford and an Associate Faculty Member at the Sanger Institute. ""This kind of integrated analysis, which we hope will soon also include epigenetic data, allows us a more complete understanding of the extent and evolution of cellular heterogeneity in normal development and disease processes.""","Published: April 29, 2015"

There s more to come. Many of these regulations center around hazardous chemicals, affecting not only their use in research laboratories but also how they are shipped, handled and used by downstream users.  One regulation in particular needs to be on everyone s radar right now. The United Nation s Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals   or GHS   is being adopted worldwide. In the U.S., OSHA is updating their Lab Safety Standard 29 CFR 1950 to accommodate GHS. In the European Union, ECHA s CLP (Classification, Labelling and Packaging) regulation is also aligned with GHS, and is driving similar new chemical management requirements.The UN's Globally Harmonized System (GHS) will dramatically change how chemicals are labeled and classified. ECHA's CLP regulation has adopted GHS for Europe. What are those requirements? In a nutshell, because GHS seeks to clarify chemical hazards and strives to reduce the associated risks, it standardizes the way in which chemicals are classified and labeled while at the same time having the chemical s associated Safety Data Sheet (SDS) follow a standardized format.  Thus a chemical or hazardous substance will be consistently classified, labeled and explained worldwide, ending the confusion that arises when two different SDS for the same chemical exist. Right now, there is a looming deadline on June 1, 2015 for manufacturers and importers that requires transition to the new chemical labels and SDS formats. It appears that many of the manufacturers are not going to be able to meet the deadline. Thus, there is significant confusion concerning who is responsible for doing what   particularly in research organizations concerned about their obligations under GHS. The good news is that OSHA and ECHA understand that implementing such changes has turned out to be significantly more difficult than initially thought, and are providing interim steps to address the challenge.  There is an opportunity to learn more about how ECHA will address these and other chemical safety challenges at the upcoming Helsinki Chemicals Forum, HCF 2015.  HCF 2015 will be held from 28-29 May 2015 at the Messukeskus Helsinki Convention Centre in Helsinki, Finland.  The packed two day event addresses such critical issues as the challenges of addressing the GHS deadlines; the future for global chemicals risk management; improving supply chain communications for chemicals in products; best practices in chemical alternatives assessment; and, green chemistry and engineering challenges.  Speakers include top officials at ECHA and other international authorities and chemical industry organizations, such as the EU s European Commission, CIEL, OECD, Environment Canada and the American Chemistry Council as well as numerous other agencies from around the world.  Preceding the conference will be the tenth annual Stakeholders' Day on 27 May 2015 that is designed for chemical manufacturers and importers who are most affected by the REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) and CLP regulations. This event offers participants the chance to hear and discuss the latest news and updates from ECHA, European industry associations and involved non-government organizations. The annual event covers the REACH and CLP regulations and participants can also schedule one-to-one sessions with ECHA staff about specific topics. There are always more questions than can be answered after every session; this year the meeting should be particularly lively in light of the looming CLP deadlines. ","Published: April 29, 2015"

By studying an important lncRNA, called Xist, the scientists identified how this RNA gathers a group of proteins and ultimately prevents women from having an extra functional X-chromosome a condition in female embryos that leads to death in early development. These findings mark the first time that researchers have uncovered the detailed mechanism of action for lncRNA genes.Artist's illustration of an X-chromosome. Caltech scientists developed a  molecular microscope  to study a new class of RNA gene and uncovered how an RNA can orchestrate the silencing of all genes across an entire chromosome. Credit: Lance Hayashida/Caltech Office of Strategic Communications ""For years, we thought about genes as just DNA sequences that encode proteins, but those genes only make up about 1 percent of the genome. Mammalian genomes also encode many thousands of lncRNAs,"" says Assistant Professor of Biology Mitch Guttman, who led the study published online in the April 27 issue of the journal Nature. These lncRNAs such as Xist play a structural role, acting to scaffold or bring together and organize the key proteins involved in cellular and molecular processes, such as gene expression and stem cell differentiation. Guttman, who helped to discover an entire class of lncRNAs as a graduate student at MIT in 2009, says that although most of these genes encoded in our genomes have only recently been appreciated, there are several specific examples of lncRNA genes that have been known for decades. One well-studied example is Xist, which is important for a process called X chromosome inactivation. All females are born with two X chromosomes in every cell, one inherited from their mother and one from their father. In contrast, males only contain one X chromosome (along with a Y chromosome). However, like males, females only need one copy of each X-chromosome gene having two copies is an abnormality that will lead to death early during development. The genome skirts these problems by essentially ""turning off"" one X chromosome in every cell. Previous research showed that Xist is essential to this process and does this by somehow preventing transcription, the initial step of the expression of genes on the X chromosome. However, because Xist is not a traditional protein-coding gene, until now researchers have had trouble figuring out exactly how Xist stops transcription and shuts down an entire chromosome. ""To start to make sense of what makes lncRNAs special and how they can control all of these different cellular processes, we need to be able to understand the mechanism of how any lncRNA gene can work. Because Xist is such an important molecule and because so much is known about what it does, it seemed like a great system to try to dissect the mechanisms of how it and other lncRNAs work,"" Guttman says. lncRNAs are known to corral and organize the proteins that are necessary for cellular processes, so Guttman and his colleagues began their study of the function of Xist by first developing a technique to find out what proteins it naturally interacts with in the cell. With a new method, called RNA antisense purification with mass spectrometry (RAP-MS), the researchers extracted and purified Xist lncRNA molecules, as well as the proteins that directly interact with Xist, from mouse embryonic stem cells. Then, collaborators at the Proteome Exploration Laboratory at Caltech applied a technique called quantitative mass spectrometry to identify those interacting proteins. ""RNA usually only obeys one rule: binding to proteins. RAP-MS is like a molecular microscope into identifying RNA-protein interactions,"" says John Rinn, associate professor of stem cell and regenerative biology at Harvard University, who was not involved in the study. ""RAP-MS will provide critically needed insights into how lncRNAs function to organize proteins and in turn regulate gene expression."" Applying this to Xist uncovered 10 specific proteins that interact with Xist. Of these, three SAF-A (Scaffold attachment factor-A), LBR (Lamin B Receptor), and SHARP (SMRT and HDAC associated repressor protein) are essential for X chromosome inactivation. ""Before this experiment,"" Guttman says, ""no one knew a single protein that was required by Xist for silencing transcription on the X chromosome, but with this method we immediately found three that are essential. If you lose any one of them, Xist doesn't work it will not silence the X chromosome during development."" The new findings provide the first detailed picture of how lncRNAs work within a cellular process. Through further analysis, the researchers found that these three proteins performed three distinct, but essential, roles. SAF-A helps to tether Xist and all of its hitchhiking proteins to the DNA of the X chromosome, at which point LBR remodels the chromosome so that it is less likely to be expressed. The actual ""silencing,"" Guttman and his colleagues discovered, is done by the third protein of the trio: SHARP. To produce functional proteins from the DNA (genes) of a chromosome, the genes must first be transcribed into RNA by an enzyme called RNA polymerase II. Guttman and his team found that SHARP leads to the exclusion of polymerase from the DNA, thus preventing transcription and gene expression. This information soon may have clinical applications. The Xist lncRNA silences the X chromosome simply because it is located on the X chromosome. However, previous studies have demonstrated that this RNA and its silencing machinery can be used to inactivate other chromosomes for example, the third copy of chromosome 21 that is present in individuals with Downs' syndrome. ""We are starting to pick apart how lncRNAs work. We now know, for example, how Xist localizes to sites on X, how it silences transcription, and how it can change DNA structure,"" Guttman says. ""One of the things that is really exciting for me is that we can potentially leverage the principles used by lncRNAs, move them around in the genome, and use them as therapeutic agents to target specific defective pathways in disease."" ""But I think the real reason why this is so important for our field and even beyond is because this is a different type of regulation than we've seen before in the cell it is a vast world that we previously knew nothing about,"" he adds.

Scientists have thought for years that this attachment occurs because feeder cells serve as a support system, providing stems cells with essential nutrients. But a new study that successfully grew stem cells with dead, or fixed, feeder cells suggests otherwise.A) Stem cell colonies adhere to and grow on live feeder cells. B) This phenomenon is unaltered when feeder cells are fixed, or dead. Image by Kiralise Silva / UTEP The discovery, described in the Journal of Materials Chemistry B, challenges the theory that feeder cells provide nutrients to growing stem cells. It also means that the relationship between the two cells is superficial, according to Binata Joddar, Ph.D., a biomedical engineer at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP).  We ve proved an important phenomenon,  said Joddar, who runs UTEP s Inspired Materials and Stem-Cell Based Tissue Engineering Lab.  And it suggests that these feeder cells, which are difficult to grow, may not be important at all for stem cell growth.  In the study, feeder cells were chemically fixed before living stem cells were placed in the same dish. Like organs that are preserved with formaldehyde, this kept the feeder cells  physical appearance the same, but essentially killed them. Even though the feeder cells were dead, the stem cells still latched on and grew successfully. The discovery offers a simpler and more cost-effective way to grow stem cells, which has proved difficult over the years.  Because feeder cells don t need to stay alive in the process, we can store them at room temperature and spend less time cultivating them,  Joddar said. Joddar believes the finding suggests that stem cells may only like the  topology  of feeder cells.  This makes me think that we use a nanomanufacturing approach to grow stem cells,  she said.  We could mimic feeder cells  nanotopology with 3-D printing techniques and skip using feeder cells altogether in the future. ","Published: April 29, 2015"

The new study points to promising new directions using a known therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer s disease a disorder that will affect nearly 14 million Americans by 2050, according to the Alzheimer s Association. The study, which was led by TSRI Associate Professors Courtney Miller and Gavin Rumbaugh, appears online ahead of print in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology. This new study builds on previous findings from Miller and Rumbaugh demonstrating the memory-rescuing potential of inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs), a family of signaling enzymes that act like molecular switches, silencing gene expression by controlling access to the cell s nuclear cache of tightly compacted DNA. Mutations in HDACs genes have been associated with health problems including cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, metabolic disorders and loss of memory function. Miller and Rumbaugh note that current efforts by many research teams focus on developing  isoform-selective  HDAC inhibitors for example, select members of Class 1 HDACs such as HDAC 1, -2 or -3 in order to limit the potential for unwanted side effects. However, the Scripps Florida researchers wondered if some of the potential of memory rescue could be lost with this increased selectivity. To investigate, in the current study, the Scripps Florida team used inhibitors initially developed by Professor Joel Gottesfeld, a molecular biologist on TSRI s La Jolla campus, and subsequently by biotech firm Repligen Corporation, to attack more than one form of Class 1 HDAC at the same time in a mouse model of Alzheimer s disease.  We wanted to find out which inhibitors were the most selective and the most effective in restoring memory function,  Miller said.  We found the key to memory restoration was the growth of new synapses (synaptogenesis), which required simultaneous inhibition of multiple HDACs.   We found evidence that better synapse growth was associated with less specific inhibition of Class 1 HDACs,  Rumbaugh added.  There was a clear correlation between synapse building  which may lead to improved network power and memory restoration by the different HDAC inhibitors.  Interestingly, memory was not enhanced in normal animals by chronic pretreatment with multiple HDAC inhibitors, suggesting a diseased brain responds to these compounds differently than a healthy brain.

Baranidharan Raman, PhD, assistant professor of biomedical engineering in the School of Engineering & Applied Science, found that locusts trained to recognize certain odors reacted differently when the odors were presented overlapping with another. While the results of this research, published in Nature Communications, focus on the sense of smell, Raman and his team plan to use the results to determine if the brain processes signals similarly for other senses. A locust has sensory neurons in its antennae that convert chemical cues, such as puffs of an odor, into electrical signals and transmit them to circuits of neurons in the brain. Raman and his team examined the change in how the neurons in the locust's brain responded to an odor depending on activity before the exposure to the odor. They were interested in understanding how the response to an odor changed depending on the stimulus that preceded it. The team discovered a feature in the way the brain processes signals: When two puffs of a similar odor were given one after the other, the spiking neural activity generated by the first encountered odor interfered with processing the second odor. As a result, even though a conserved set of neurons responded to the newer odor, the spiking activity patterns that would normally be brought on were disturbed. However, when two different odor puffs were given in overlapping succession, there was less interference to the brain's response evoked by the second odor. For this study, Raman and his team used Pavolovian conditioning to train hungry locusts to respond to a puff of an odor by rewarding them with a piece of grass. After being trained, the locusts moved their palps, small sensory appendages near their mouth parts, in response to an odor puff they had been trained to recognize. William Padovano, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering and a researcher in Raman's lab, painted the tips of the locust palps with a green paint to make them more visible and distinct compared to the surrounding parts. After videotaping the locusts' response to the odor puff, Padovano was able to filter out the motion of the painted palps and track the locusts' behavior very precisely. He saw that when an odor puff was given, the locust moved its palps in anticipation of its reward. ""We found that the locusts recognize the odor and move their palps within roughly 500 milliseconds,"" Raman says. ""Once trained, the locusts did not forget the learned association easily. Even when we presented the trained odorant multiple times without any reward and in different ways, alone or in sequence, there was always a response."" The team sought to compare the changes in the neural and behavioral response when the locusts were given an odor they had been trained to recognize but manipulated to follow another odor they had not been trained to recognize.   ""The locusts robustly recognized and responded to the trained odor whether it was presented alone or after another odor, but their response time and behavior were less predictable when the trained odor followed a similar odor that evoked highly overlapping neural activity,"" Raman says. But when two different odors were presented, the locusts' response was very predictable. ""When the two different odors were in a sequence, the locusts responded quickly and predictably to the trained odor, because it was novel,"" Raman says. ""The more novel the stimulus, the more preserved the pattern of the spiking activity becomes and more predictable the behavioral responses were."" Raman says the change in the neural response patterns they observed with stimulus history presents a general phenomenon about neural networks in the brain. ""This has helped us to finalize that even though the pattern of spiking activity over time has changed, the odor identity has not changed,"" Raman says. ""The odor identity is completely encoded by which combinations of neurons are activated. The temporal dimension is used to emphasize or de-emphasize odorants based on their novelty."" Raman and his team plan to continue investigating neural responses. ""Given that we know we have a paradigm where we can very finely track the behavior, we can make very fine calculations with neural activity to understand how each aspect of neural response is related to behavior,"" he says.

Some students only have writing disabilities, but some have both reading and writing disabilities. The study, published online in NeuroImage: Clinical, is among the first to identify structural white matter and functional gray matter differences in the brain between children with dyslexia and dysgraphia, and between those children and typical language learners. The researchers say the findings underscore the need to provide instruction tailored to each of these specific learning disabilities, though that is currently not mandated under U.S. federal or state law. ""This shows that there's a brain basis for these different disabilities,"" said co-author Virginia Berninger, a psychologist who heads the UW Learning Disabilities Center, funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. ""So they require different diagnoses, and different instruction. We've got to start acknowledging this."" The study involved 40 children in grades 4 to 9, including 17 diagnosed with dyslexia   persisting difficulty with word reading and spelling   and 14 diagnosed with dysgraphia, persisting difficulty with handwriting, along with nine typical language learners. The children were asked to write the next letter in the alphabet following a letter they were shown, to write the missing letter in a word spelling, to rest without any task, and to plan a text about astronauts. The children used a fiber-optic pen developed at the UW that allowed researchers to record their writing in real time while their active brain connections were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. The three groups differed from each other in written language and cognitive tasks. The control group had more white matter connections, which facilitate functional connections in gray matter for language processing and cognitive thinking. By contrast, children with dyslexia and dysgraphia showed less white matter connections and more functional connections to gray matter locations   in other words, their brains had to work harder to accomplish the same tasks.""Their brains were less efficient for language processing,"" said lead author Todd Richards, a UW professor of radiology. The results, Berninger said, show that the two specific learning disabilities are not the same because the white matter connections and patterns and number of gray matter functional connections were not the same in the children with dyslexia and dysgraphia   on either the writing or cognitive thinking tasks. Federal law guarantees a free and appropriate public education to children with learning disabilities, but does not require that specific types of learning disabilities are diagnosed, or that schools provide evidence-based instruction for dyslexia or dysgraphia. Consequently, the two conditions are lumped together under a general category for learning disabilities, Berninger said, and many schools do not recognize them or offer specialized instruction for either one. ""There's just this umbrella category of learning disability,"" said Berninger. ""That's like saying if you're sick you qualify to see a doctor, but without specifying what kind of illness you have, can the doctor prescribe appropriate treatment?""  Many children struggle in school because their specific learning disabilities are not identified and they are not provided appropriate instruction,"" Berninger said. Recent UW research published in February in Computers & Education shows that computerized instruction has tremendous potential to help time-strapped teachers in regular classrooms provide such instruction for children with dyslexia and dysgraphia, but only if they are correctly diagnosed. ""Dyslexia and dysgraphia are not the only kinds of learning disabilities. One in five students in the United States may have some kind of a specific learning disability,"" Berninger said.

Getting rid of earworms is tricky but the academic believes the solution is to be found in gum; the act of gum-chewing is very similar to irrelevant sub-vocalisation, which has proved to degrade short term memory performance as well as auditory images. Not only ""auditory images [are] less vivid when [individuals are] engaged in tasks"" loading on their inner voice, but irrelevant sub-vocalisation, like chewing, reduces the repetition of sticky tunes, explains Beaman. To test this theory the team carried out three separate experiments, in which participants were exposed to catchy tunes while either chewing or not chewing gum. Experiment 1 evaluated the effect of bubble-gum on the conscious appearance of musical images, as well as the recurrence of earworms once attempts to suppress them had ceased; participants exposed to a popular melody were first asked not to think about the music, and then let free to do so. Predictably, results proved gum-chewing reduced the number of times the tune was consciously experienced in both music suppression and overt expression condition. Experiment 2, which looked at the actual  hearing  of music in participants  heads, also demonstrated the reducing effect of gum-chewing upon the music-hearing phenomenon. Last but not the least, Experiment 3 was designed to assess whether the effects of gum were common to any kind of motor activity, or specific to the speech articulators only; to this end, partakers were asked to either chew some gum or tap with their fingers at the beat of a novel melody. Interestingly, the outcome showed that motor activity per se (tapping) was less effective than sub-vocal actions (chewing) in moderating the appearance of earworms. The first to look at gum in the context of voluntary as well as involuntary musical imagery, this study demonstrates chewing gum interferes with the experience of hearing musical recollections therefore can be recommended as an aid to get rid of earworms. So, next time we get stuck with a tune, let s forget intricate anagrams and get some bubble-gum instead. Taylor & Francis C. Philip Beaman, Kitty Powell, Ellie Rapley.

Concussion, also known as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), is a common medical problem affecting cognitive function and quality of life in some individuals. In most cases, patients who experience mTBI will recover fully, typically within three months. Ten to fifteen percent of mTBI patients will continue to experience persistent disabling problems beyond three months, which can include post-traumatic headache, sleep disturbance, loss of balance, memory and other cognitive impairments, fatigue, and mood or affective disorders. The lasting effects of concussion have received widespread attention in recent years and caused growing concern, particularly among amateur and professional athletes and sports organizations. Several reports have indicated that female athletes suffer concussions at a higher rate than male athletes playing similar sports. ""In clinical practice, more women than men seek medical attention due to persistent symptoms after mTBI at a ratio of almost 2:1,"" said the study's lead author, Chi-Jen Chen, M.D., from the Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Brain and Consciousness Research Center at Taipei Medical University Shuang-Ho Hospital and superintendent at Chia-Yi Hospital in Taiwan. ""We started to wonder whether there might be differences in mTBI outcomes between men and women."" Dr. Chen and colleagues set out to objectively evaluate gender differences in mTBI by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to analyze brain activation patterns during working memory tasks. ""Difficulty with working memory is a commonly reported impairment after mTBI,"" Dr. Chen said. ""Since working memory is important for a wide variety of cognitive skills, compromised working memory could have significant effects on everyday life."" The researchers studied 30 patients with mTBI and 30 control patients. Both groups contained an equal number of men and women. Patients underwent an fMRI exam within one month after injury and a follow-up fMRI exam at six weeks after first scan. All participants underwent neuropsychological tests, including digit span and continuous performance test (CPT). Digit span is a short-term memory test measuring how many numbers a participant can remember in sequence. CPT measures a person's sustained and selective attention and impulsivity. Initial fMRI results of the mTBI patients showed increased activation in working memory brain circuits in the men and decreased activation in the women, compared to the controls. At follow-up, men with mTBI returned to a normal activation pattern similar to the controls, whereas the women showed persistent hypoactivation, suggesting ongoing working memory problems. Neuropsychological results showed that among the women, the total digit span score was lower in the mTBI group, compared to the control group. ""These findings provide evidence that female gender may be a risk factor for working memory impairment after mTBI,"" Dr. Chen said. ""If so, more aggressive management should be initiated once MTBI is diagnosed in female patients."" Because fMRI has the potential to detect working memory impairment, predict outcome and monitor treatment effect, incorporation of fMRI into treatment protocol for mTBI may be advisable in the future, according to Dr. Chen. However, he cautions that further study needs to be done to validate these preliminary findings.

With these projects a total of   1.2 million grants were procured for Enzymicals. The company thus has the opportunity to focus more on the scale-up and piloting of biocatalytic processes, on developing new products and on promoting young scientists. At the same time these projects strengthen the company s international network. An important project is the COSMOS project which will be running over 54 months. The aim of the project is to increase Europe's independence of imported coconut and palm kernel oils and fatty acids as well as castor oil. These are currently important sources of raw materials for the production of various fatty acids. The fatty acids are starting materials for the production of plastics, surfactants, detergents,lubricants and many others. From robust indigenous oil plants oils are extracted which are more suitable for obtaining these fatty acids than e.g. Rapeseed oil. The project includes work on the cultivation of oil crops, on optimizing the composition and on increasing the yield of the pressed oils. Other tasks deal with the separation and purification of the fatty acids which are extracted from crude product. Further aspects are processes for producing the desired fatty acids and the recycling of waste materials from the oil crops and press cake. In the consortium 18 partners from 9 countries work together. The entire project is funded by the EU with   10.8 million. In the separation and purification of the fatty acids selective enzyme technology will be used. The task of Enzymicals is the upscaling and the piloting of the manufacturing process for lipases which are suitable for these processes. In the CARBAZYMES project a total of   9.3 million will be invested. Funding from the EU is   8.3 million over four years. The international, multidisciplinary consortium consists of 14 companies and research centers in 5 countries. In the chemical industry, there is a great need for robust, industrially useful biocatalysts for the formation of carbon bonds. The classical chemical reactions involve the use of hazardous substances and a high energy consumption. The use of enzymes has great potential to improve these processes both from an economic and from an environmental point of view. The aim of the CARBAZYMES project is the development and subsequent scale up to an industrial process for four pharmaceutical intermediates and three bulk chemicals. In this project Enzymicals works on the process of manufacturing an intermediate for a frequently used drug. For this purpose unique enzymes produced by Enzymicals are tested, and the process will be increased up to the 100L scale.  Enzymicals is an industry partner in the innovative training network Marie Curie BIOCASCADES for European industrial doctorates (ITN Enzymicals AG 3 EID). In this Research Network seven universities and five industrial companies from five European countries are involved. In total eleven ESRs (early stage researchers) will be dealing with the development of sustainable cascade reactions for the production of specific amines and amino alcohols. These are important intermediates for pharmaceutically active substances such as those used in drugs for emergency treatment of anaphylaxis (allergic shock) or in cough solvers. Enzymicals contributes here with a position for a young scientist and the provision of several workplaces for exchange scientists. With all three projects Enzymicals highlights its positioning as a developer of industrially applicable biocatalytic processes in pilot scale. ","Published: April 28, 2015"

The move will see the installation of a new Class 100,000 suite at its facility in North East England aimed at satisfying an upsurge in Phase I/II GMP campaigns from clients in Europe and the USA. Onyx Scientific specialises in pre-clinical/clinical development projects and expansion plans were given the go ahead at the contract research organisation (CRO) following another successful audit by the MHRA in February. Celebrating its 15th birthday this year, the CRO provides clients with the production of API up to 50l-100l under current GMP regulations, which dovetails its earlier stage custom synthesis, lead optimisation, solid state and analytical services. Denise Bowser, commercial director at Onyx Scientific, said:  This latest investment will bring the total capacity at our UK site up to four dedicated GMP suites, which represents a steady but significant growth in this area over the past few years.  We have worked with hundreds of clients at the small scale non-GMP stage and have been able to provide rapid scale up to GMP for many of them with the same technical team, all under one roof.   So by having an additional GMP suite at our disposal, it gives us even greater flexibility to assist our clients that are under increasing timeline pressure to deliver against their development programs.  This latest venture by the chemistry specialist follows a significant investment into continuous flow manufacturing last year. This has allowed its clients to explore alternatives during product research and development programs, while overcoming the often time-consuming and costly process of batch manufacturing. Onyx Scientific has achieved preferred partner status and undertaken GMP projects for some of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies and major institutions such as Cancer Research UK. The company also works with many specialty drug development firms and biotech organisations across the globe, helping accelerate candidates from discovery to production. The CRO s team has built a strong reputation for dealing with some of the most complex early stage chemistry challenges for companies developing new compounds. The IPCA Laboratories-owned CRO assists companies with medicinal chemistry through Phase I-III. The UK site is then able to scale-up, tech transfer and increase efficiency using its parent company s large scale API manufacturing sites in India.","Published: April 28, 2015"

For the first time, an international consortium of bioinformatics educators and trainers across the globe have come together to transcend institutional and international boundaries to share bioinformatics training expertise, experience, and resources. The Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Learning, Education & Training (GOBLET), which includes The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC), is focusing on developing a training portal into a global, community-centred resource and supporting activities to aid the next generation of bioinformaticians. GOBLET aims to develop high-quality, comprehensive, branded training materials and courses, and is currently exploring accreditation mechanisms. The recent advancement of high-throughput technologies and big data in the life sciences has left in its wake a high demand for bioinformatics training. Universities are finding it hard to keep up with this demand, where many students and early-stage researchers are feeling the impact across continents, not having the relevant skills to manage, analyse, and interpret data with confidence. Formed in 2012, GOBLET is a not-for-profit foundation working on the development of an open and sustainable support structure for global bioinformatics communities. Through building and sustaining a collaborative community that shares resources, best practices and expertise, GOBLET aims to improve the standard of bioinformatics training provided worldwide. Previous provision for bioinformatics training for life scientists struggled to meet the needs of this diverse group and keep pace with the rapidly evolving field of bioinformatics. The global standard of training also suffered owing to a lack of co-ordination between research sectors, leading to duplication and waste of resources. However, as technological advances have continued to increase the quantity of data available for analysis, it has become ever more crucial that life scientists receive effective bioinformatics training to allow them to conduct successful research. By ensuring that life scientists understand how to best apply bioinformatics tools, this training facilitates both better use of data and easier communication between life and computational scientists, resulting in a higher standard of research. Since its formation, GOBLET has quadrupled its membership and successfully built upon the earlier work of the Bioinformatics Training Network. Over recent years, GOBLET s achievements have included: co-launching with the ISCB Education committee a Community of Special Interest (CoSI) for Computational Biology Education (CoBE) at the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference 2014; running various community-building events and workshops for the discussion of the design and content of bioinformatics training, and launching a training portal that acts as both a central repository of training materials and courses, and a catalogue of trainers and course organisers. Vicky Schneider, a member of the GOBLET executive and Head of 361  Division at TGAC, said:  We are really proud to be part of GOBLET and the great work that has already taken place in preparing the current and next generation of bioinformaticians. It s fantastic that the training portal is being developed as an accessible resource to raise the standard of data research within the global scientific community.  Emily Angiolini, Scientific Training and Education Team Manager in 361o Division at TGAC, said  It is vital that we begin to bridge this gap in skills and the open sharing of relevant training materials coupled with the community engagement offered by GOBLET is leap in the right direction.

Released in top journal Pain this month, the study points to TMPRSS2 as the culprit: a gene that is also responsible for some of the most aggressive forms of androgen-fuelled cancers. Head of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Faculty of Dentistry, Lam s research initially focused on cancers of the head and neck, which affect more than 550,000 people worldwide each year. Studies have shown that these types of cancers are the most painful, with sufferers experiencing pain that is immediate and localized, while pain treatment options are limited to opioid-family pharmaceuticals such as morphine. It was while conducting clinical research at the University of California San Francisco, though, that Lam noticed something interesting. A majority of head and neck cancer patients are men   leading him to investigate a genetic marker with a known correlation to prostate cancer, TMPRSS2.  Prostate cancer research already knows that if you have the TMPRSS2 gene marker, the prostate cancer is much more aggressive. They ve also shown that this is androgen (male hormone) sensitive.  In his study, Lam, who is jointly appointed as a Consultant Surgeon at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and a Clinician at the Mount Sinai Wasser Pain Management Centre, ascertained that TMPRSS2 was not only present in patients suffering from head and neck cancers   it was also prevalent in much greater quantities than in prostate cancer. But was there a link to pain? Visible on the surface of the cancer cells, TMPRSS2 comes into contact with the body s nerve pain receptors, which then triggers the pain. Lam was also able to determine a clear, correlative relationship between the two: the more TMPRSS2 that comes into contact with nerve pain receptors, the greater pain is provoked. Lam and his fellow researchers followed up this observation by looking at different types of cancers with known pain associations   for instance, certain breast and melanoma cell lines. These cells were grown and labelled for the TMPRSS2 genetic marker. According to clinical data, head and neck cancer is the most painful form of cancer, followed by prostate cancer, while melanoma, or skin cancer, sits at the bottom of the pain scale. But what surprised the researchers was that the presence and amount of TMPRSS2 in these cancer cell cultures stood in exact correlation with the known level of pain each cancer causes.  It was exactly what we know clinically about pain association,  adds Lam. A New Direction for Drug Research  The startling discovery of TMPRSS2 s role in triggering cancer pain may lead to the creation of targeted cancer pain therapies that effectively shut down the expression of this gene or its ability to infiltrate pain receptors in the body. Dr. Brian Schmidt, Professor at New York University College of Dentistry, Director of the Bluestone Center for Clinical Research and a co-author of the study states,  The discovery that TMPRSS2 drives cancer pain demonstrates another way that cancers lead to suffering. Inhibition of its activity in patients might provide a new form of treatment for cancer pain. Any cancer that is painful before initiating drug treatment   we can label the cancer cells for TMPRSS2 and look for this particular marker,  explains Lam, who adds that the most effective approach to ending pain would be to target the production and expression of the pain gene. But there may be other ramifications to the TMPRSS2 study: further research may yet uncover what role the increased expression of TMPRSS2 plays in the aggressiveness and morbidity rates associated with certain aggressive cancers   and whether or not shutting down the pain gene will have any other beneficial side effects than reducing discomfort. The study also involved researchers from New York University and the Forsyth Institute (Cambridge).","Published: April 28, 2015"

A study by Rebecca Klaper at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee determined exposure to the diabetes medicine metformin causes physical changes in male fish exposed to doses similar to the amount in wastewater effluent.In addition to intersex conditions, fish exposed to metformin were smaller in size than those not exposed, said Klaper, a professor in UWM s School of Freshwater Sciences. The study, co-authored by Nicholas Niemuth, a researcher in Klaper s lab, was recently published in the journal Chemosphere. Because intersex fish are particularly prevalent downstream from wastewater treatment plants, many studies have investigated the effect of hormones from birth control pills, Klaper said. Initially, the results of her study seemed surprising since metformin is not a hormone and it targets blood sugar regulation. But Klaper said it is also prescribed to women with a common hormonal disease called polycystic ovary syndrome. The research in her lab indicates metformin could be a potential endocrine disruptor   a chemical that confuses the body s complicated hormonal messaging system, interrupting a range of normal activities, including reproduction. Of the chemicals she has detected in water samples collected from Lake Michigan, metformin stands out, Klaper said.  It is the chemical we found in almost every sample and in the highest concentrations compared to other emerging contaminants   even higher than caffeine,  she said. The prevalence of the chemical in samples led Klaper to investigate what effects the medication may have in the environment. In a previous study, she exposed mature fish to metformin, and although there were no physical changes, she found the genes related to hormones for egg production were being expressed in males as well as females   an indication of endocrine disruption. For the current study, the researchers monitored fish that had continuous exposure to metformin from birth to adulthood. The next step is to determine the corresponding changes in the genome, which Klaper is doing at UWM s Great Lakes Genomic Center.  We re now working on a paper that investigates the metabolic pathways at various points in the fishes  life to see what is changing with exposure,  she says.","Published: April 28, 2015"

Dubbed  chemo-brain,  the negative cognitive effects of the cancer treatment have long been suspected, but the UBC study is the first to explain why patients have difficulty paying attention. Breast cancer survivors were asked to complete a set of tasks while researchers in the Departments of Psychology and Physical Therapy monitored their brain activity. What they found is that the minds of people with chemo-brain lack the ability for sustained focused thought.  A healthy brain spends some time wandering and some time engaged,  said Todd Handy, a professor of psychology at UBC.  We found that chemo brain is a chronically wandering brain, they re essentially stuck in a shut out mode.  Handy explains that healthy brains function in a cyclic way. People can focus on a task and be completely engaged for a few seconds and then will let their mind wander a bit. The research team that included former PhD student Julia Kam, the first author of the study, found that chemo brains tend to stay in that disengaged state. To make matters worse, even when women thought they were focusing on a task, the measurements indicated that a large part of their brain was turned off and their mind was wandering. The researchers also found evidence that these women were more focused on their inner world. When the women were not performing a task and simply asked to relax, their brain was more active compared to healthy women. Kristin Campbell, an associate professor in the Department of Physical Therapy and leader of the research team, says these findings could help health care providers measure the effects of chemotherapy on the brain.  Physicians now recognize that the effects of cancer treatment persist long after its over and these effects can really impact a person s life,  said Campbell. Tests developed for other cognitive disorders like brain injury or Alzheimer s have proven ineffective for measuring chemo brain.  Cancer survivors tend to be able to complete these tests but then struggle to cope at work or in social situations because they find they are forgetful.  These findings could offer a new way to test for chemo brain in patients and to monitor if they are getting better over time,  said Campbell, who also conducts research to measure how exercise can improve cognitive function for women experiencing chemo brain.

Since these activity levels are important in learning, memory and brain disorders, the researchers think their finding will shed light on a range of important questions.  We used to think that once a cell reaches full maturation, its DNA is totally stable, including the molecular tags attached to it to control its genes and maintain the cell s identity,  says Hongjun Song, Ph.D., a professor of neurology and neuroscience in the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine s Institute for Cell Engineering.  This research shows that some cells actually alter their DNA all the time, just to perform everyday functions.  This DNA alteration is called DNA demethylation. Methyl groups are regulatory tags that are permanently bound to cytosines, the C s in DNA s four-letter alphabet. Removing them is a multistep process that requires excising a tagged cytosine from the long string of paired  letters  that make up a chromosome and, ideally, replacing it with an untagged cytosine. Because the process involves making a cut into DNA, it leaves the DNA somewhat vulnerable to mutations, so most cells use the process sparingly, mostly for correcting errors. But recent studies had turned up evidence that mammals  brains exhibit highly dynamic DNA modification activity   more than in any other area of the body   and Song s group wanted to know why all this risky business was going on in such a vulnerable tissue as the brain. The main job of neurons is to communicate with other neurons through connections called synapses. At each synapse, an initiating neuron releases chemical messengers, which are intercepted by receptor proteins on the receiving neuron. Neurons can toggle the  volume  of this communication by adjusting the activity level of their genes to change the number of their messengers or receptors on the surface of the neuron. When Song s team added various drugs to neurons taken from mouse brains, their synaptic activity   the volume of their communication   went up and down accordingly. When it was up, so was the activity of the Tet3 gene, which kicks off DNA demethylation. When it was down, Tet3 was down too. Then, they flipped the experiment around and manipulated the levels of Tet3 in the cells. Surprisingly, when Tet3 levels were up, synaptic activity was down; when Tet3 levels were down, synaptic activity was up. So do Tet3 levels depend on synaptic activity, or is it the other way around? Another series of experiments showed them that one of the changes occurring in neurons in response to low levels of Tet3 was an increase in the protein GluR1 at their synapses. Since GluR1 is a receptor for chemical messengers, its abundance at synapses is one of the ways neurons can toggle their synaptic activity. The scientists say they have discovered another mechanism used by neurons to maintain relatively consistent levels of synaptic activity so that neurons can remain responsive to the signaling around them. If synaptic activity increases, Tet3 activity and base excision of tagged cytosines increases. This causes the levels of GluR1 at synapses to decrease, in turn, which decreases their overall strength, bringing the synapses back to their previous activity level. The opposite can also happen, resulting in increasing synaptic activity in response to an initial decrease. So Tet3 levels respond to synaptic activity levels, and synaptic activity levels respond to Tet3 levels. Song says:  If you shut off neural activity, the neurons  turn up their volume  to try to get back to their usual level and vice versa. But they can t do it without Tet3.  Song adds that the ability to regulate synapse activity is the most fundamental property of neurons:  It s how our brains form circuits that contain information.  Since this synaptic flexibility seems to require mildly risky DNA surgery to work, Song wonders if some brain disorders might arise from neurons losing their ability to  heal  properly after base excision. He thinks this study brings us one step closer to finding out. Johns Hopkins Medicine   press release Huimei Yu, Yijing Su, Jaehoon Shin, Chun Zhong, Junjie U. Guo, Yi-Lan Weng, Fuying Gao, Daniel H.

For more than a century, neuroscientists have tried to uncover the structure of the brain's neuronal circuits in order to better understand how the brain works. These brain circuits, which perform functions such as processing information and triggering reflexes, are composed of neurons that work together to carry out a specialized function. Neurons send the messages to other neurons, or to target tissues such as skin and muscle that they innervate, via their specialized wire-like processes, axons. In the same way that we need to know the exact wiring of an electrical circuit to understand how it works, it's necessary to map the axonal wiring of neuronal circuits to understand how they function. Therefore a fundamental goal of neuroscience research is to understand the structural and functional connections of the brain's circuits. While numerous scientific consortiums have advanced our understanding of neuronal organization, the available mapping techniques remain imperfect: for example, serial electron microscope techniques are limited in the area they can map, and tracer-based techniques are limited in the detail resolution. Now, scientists from Dr. Alex Binshtok's laboratory at the Hebrew University's Faculty of Medicine and Dr. Jeff Lichtman's laboratory at Harvard University have described a method to map the location of the axonal branches (""arbors"") of many individual neurons simultaneously, at the resolution of individual axons. Thus, by ""seeing"" many axons in the same preparation, it becomes possible to understand how specific neurons in one region are wired to other neuronal types and other regions. This new approach makes it possible to learn about organizational principles of neuronal networks that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to study. The research was conducted by Dr. Shlomo Tsuriel, a postdoctoral fellow from Dr. Alex Binshtok's lab and the study's lead author, with help from student Sagi Gudes, under the guidance of Dr. Binshtok at the Hebrew University's Faculty of Medicine (Department of Medical Neurobiology at the Institute for Medical Research Israel Canada) and at The Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences. The research was conducted in collaboration with Dr. Jeff Lichtman from Harvard University's Center for Brain Science and Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology. Instead of trying to trace entire neurons all the way from the axon tips to the cell body, Dr. Tsuriel labeled only the cell body, but in a way that indicates the locations of its axonal branches. To that end, he used multiple injections in overlapping regions of a target tissue, with three or more differently colored retrograde tracers. At each point the tracer was injected in a high concentration and spread to the area between the injection points, such that each area in the target tissue had a different color combination depending on its distance from the injection site. Axons innervating each area took up the dyes and transported them in small vesicles to the cell body, such that each vesicle had a color combination reflecting the area it was taken from. A few hours after the injection, each neuronal cell body was filled with vesicles in a variety of colors reflecting the colors in the areas that these neurons innervate. Thus, based on the combinations and intensities of the colors in the individual vesicles transported to the cell, the projection sites of the axon can be outlined. This approach is in some ways analogous to the principle used in a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, which uses distances from three or more satellites to triangulate its position. For this reason the new technique was called ""Neuronal Positioning System"" (NPS). The description of this new method is presented in Nature Methods. According to Hebrew University's Dr. Alex Binshtok: ""The new method that we developed allows us to answer a 'big question' in neuroscience about the organizational principles of neuronal circuits. Using the NPS technique that maps many axons in same tissue, we now can study what defines the routes along which the neurons will send their projections, as well as their targets. We can also learn how the wiring of the neuronal circuits changes during development and in a variety of pathological conditions. The answers to these questions will be the first step to comprehending how the information flows and is processed in the nervous system, and how changes in the neuronal organization affect neuronal function. I believe many scientists will find the NPS approach useful to help them answer the question of how the brain works.""

These results suggest that exercise could be prescribed to lessen age-related declines in brain structure. The findings, which appear online in the Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology, are the first to show a relationship between fitness and brain structure in older adults, but not younger adults. The researchers compared younger adults (age 18-31) to older adults (age 55-82). All participants had MRIs taken of their brains and their cardiorespiratory (heart and lung) fitness was measured while they exercised on a treadmill. The researchers found cardiorespiratory fitness was positively linked to the structural integrity of white matter fiber bundles in the brain in the older adults, while no such association was observed in younger adults. ""We found that higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with enhanced brain structure in older adults,"" explained corresponding author Scott Hayes, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine and the associate director of the Neuroimaging Research for Veterans Center at the VA Boston Healthcare System. ""We found that physical activities that enhance cardiorespiratory fitness, such as walking, are inexpensive, accessible and could potentially improve quality of life by delaying cognitive decline and prolonging independent function,"" he added. According to the researchers these results provide evidence of a positive association between fitness and brain structure in older adults. ""We hope this study provides additional motivation for older adults to increase their levels of physical activity, which positively impacts health, mood, cognition and the brain."" They caution that additional research is needed to track changes in fitness and brain structure over time, as well as clarify the impact of specific exercise programs (such as strength, aerobic or combined training) or dose of exercise (frequency, intensity, duration) on white matter microstructure.

The study, published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research, provides new insights at the cellular level for how alcohol exposure during adolescence, before the brain is fully developed, can result in cellular and synaptic abnormalities that have enduring, detrimental effects on behavior. ""In the eyes of the law, once people reach the age of 18, they are considered adult, but the brain continues to mature and refine all the way into the mid-20s,"" said lead author Mary-Louise Risher, Ph.D., a post-doctoral researcher in the Duke Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. ""It's important for young people to know that when they drink heavily during this period of development, there could be changes occurring that have a lasting impact on memory and other cognitive functions."" Risher and colleagues, including senior author Scott Swartzwelder, Ph.D., a professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Duke and Senior Research Career Scientist at the Durham VA Medical Center, periodically exposed young rodents to a level of alcohol during adolescence that, in humans, would result in impairment, but not sedation. Afterward, these animals received no further exposure to alcohol, and grew into adulthood - which in rats occurred within 24 to 29 days. Earlier studies by the Duke team and others have shown that adolescent animals exposed to alcohol grow into adults that are much less adept at memory tasks than normal animals - even with no further alcohol exposure. What has not been known is how these impairments manifest at the cellular level in the region of the brain known as the hippocampus, where memory and learning are controlled. Using small electrical stimuli applied to the hippocampus, the Duke team measured a cellular mechanism called long-term potentiation, or LTP, which is the strengthening of brain synapses as they are used to learn new tasks or conjure memories. Learning occurs best when this synaptic activity is vigorous enough to build strong signal transmissions between neurons. LTP is highest in the young, and effective learning is crucial for adolescents to acquire large amounts of new memory during the transition to adulthood. The researchers expected they would find abnormally diminished LTP in the adult rats that had been exposed to alcohol during their adolescence. Surprisingly, however, LTP was actually hyperactive in these animals compared to the unexposed rodents. ""At first blush, you would think the animals would be smarter,"" Swartzwelder said. ""But that's the opposite of what we found. And it actually does make sense, because if you produce too much LTP in one of these circuits, there is a period of time where you can't produce any more. The circuit is saturated, and the animal stops learning. For learning to be efficient, your brain needs a delicate balance of excitation and inhibition - too much in either direction and the circuits do not work optimally."" Importantly, the LTP abnormality was accompanied by a structural change in individual nerve cells that Swartzwelder, Risher and colleagues identified. The tiny protrusions from the branches of the cells, called dendritic spines, had appeared lanky and spindly, suggesting immaturity. Mature spines are shorter and look a bit like mushrooms, refining cell-to-cell communication. ""Something happens during adolescent alcohol exposure that changes the way the hippocampus and other regions of the brain function and how the cells actually look - both the LTP and the dendritic spines have an immature appearance in adulthood,"" Swartzwelder said. Risher said this immature quality of the brain cells might be associated with behavioral immaturity. In addition to spine changes in the hippocampus, which affects learning, colleagues of the Duke group have shown structural changes in other brain regions that control impulsiveness and emotionality. ""It's quite possible that alcohol disrupts the maturation process, which can affect these cognitive function later on,"" she said. ""That's something we are eager to explore in ongoing studies."" The researchers said additional studies would focus on the longer-term cognitive effects of alcohol on brains, along with additional cellular changes.

In a two-experiment study, published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, UO neuroscientists Paul Dassonville and Scott A. Reed used eye-tracker technology in a dark laboratory to test a developing theory about how the brain determines the locations of nearby objects. In a test of perception, 20 students were asked to report whether a line was tilted left or right of vertical. Their performance in this simple task became skewed, however, when the line was shown within a tilted frame. A left-leaning frame caused the line to appear tilted to the right, and vice versa. In spite of this well-known visual illusion, when subjects were asked to look at the end of the line they had no trouble making accurate eye movements, demonstrating an apparent difference in the way that perception and actions respond to the illusion. Similar demonstrations have led other researchers to suggest that the brain forms two maps of space -- an illusion-prone map for creating conscious perception of the world, and an illusion-resistant map used for guiding movements. Results of the new experiments showed that accurate eye movements to the end of the line prove to be the exception, rather than the rule. When subjects were instead asked to make simple vertical eye movements, for example, those movements were affected by the tilted frame just as visual perception had been. ""In the lab, we explore the kinds of assumptions the brain makes about the world around us,"" said Dassonville, professor of psychology and member of the Institute of Neuroscience. In the real world, he said, judgments about an object's orientation are aided by visual clues that help anchor the perception of vertical, such as the view of a doorframe, a window frame or where two walls meet. In the laboratory, these cues were replaced by misleading cues of the tilted frame, resulting in the illusion. ""The tilted frame distorts our perception of vertical just as our sense of direction would be distorted by a compass that incorrectly points west instead of north. If you try to walk north using a broken compass, you'll head off in the wrong direction,"" said Dassonville. ""The perceptual illusion caused by our tilted frame is analogous to a treasure map that is created using the faulty compass. The map is technically incorrect, but as long as you use the combination of the faulty map and the faulty compass to navigate around, you'll be able to accurately find the treasure once again. The errors cancel out."" In the experimental task, the cancelation of errors allowed the subjects to make accurate movements to the end of the line in spite of the illusion. These new conclusions challenge the model of visual function that suggests that conscious perception of an object's location is formed in a wholly different part of the brain than that used for guiding actions, says co-author Scott A. Reed, an adjunct instructor in the Department of Psychology. ""We agree there are separate pathways in the brain for different aspects of visual function,"" Dassonville said, ""but it's not the case that one is only about perception and the other is only about action."" ""What we found in our study,"" Reed said, ""is that the brain relies on a shared representation of space that is used to both make perceptual judgments about the world and to guide behavior.""

And it s tunable in real time, meaning you can quickly and simply produce different colors, a unique and useful feature. The laser technology could lead to practical applications, such as a new form of a  lab on a chip  for medical diagnostics. To understand the concept, imagine a laser pointer whose color can be changed simply by changing the liquid inside it, instead of needing a different laser pointer for every desired color. In addition to changing color in real time, the liquid nanolaser has additional advantages over other nanolasers: it is simple to make, inexpensive to produce and operates at room temperature. Nanoscopic lasers -- first demonstrated in 2009 -- are only found in research labs today. They are, however, of great interest for advances in technology and for military applications.  Our study allows us to think about new laser designs and what could be possible if they could actually be made,  said Teri W. Odom, who led the research.  My lab likes to go after new materials, new structures and new ways of putting them together to achieve things not yet imagined. We believe this work represents a conceptual and practical engineering advance for on-demand, reversible control of light from nanoscopic sources.  Odom is Board of Lady Managers of the Columbian Exposition Professor of Chemistry in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. The findings were published by the journal Nature Communications. The liquid nanolaser in this study is not a laser pointer but a laser device on a chip, Odom explained. The laser s color can be changed in real time when the liquid dye in the microfluidic channel above the laser s cavity is changed. The laser s cavity is made up of an array of reflective gold nanoparticles, where the light is concentrated around each nanoparticle and then amplified. (In contrast to conventional laser cavities, no mirrors are required for the light to bounce back and forth.) Notably, as the laser color is tuned, the nanoparticle cavity stays fixed and does not change; only the liquid gain around the nanoparticles changes. The main advantages of very small lasers are:   They can be used as on-chip light sources for optoelectronic integrated circuits;   They can be used in optical data storage and lithography;   They can operate reliably at one wavelength; and   They should be able to operate much faster than conventional lasers because they are made from metals. Some technical background Plasmon lasers are promising nanoscale coherent sources of optical fields because they support ultra-small sizes and show ultra-fast dynamics. Although plasmon lasers have been demonstrated at different spectral ranges, from the ultraviolet to near-infrared, a systematic approach to manipulate the lasing emission wavelength in real time has not been possible. The main limitation is that only solid gain materials have been used in previous work on plasmon nanolasers; hence, fixed wavelengths were shown because solid materials cannot easily be modified. Odom s research team has found a way to integrate liquid gain materials with gold nanoparticle arrays to achieve nanoscale plasmon lasing that can be tuned dynamical, reversibly and in real time. The use of liquid gain materials has two significant benefits:   The organic dye molecules can be readily dissolved in solvents with different refractive indices. Thus, the dielectric environment around the nanoparticle arrays can be tuned, which also tunes the lasing wavelength.   The liquid form of gain materials enables the fluid to be manipulated within a microfluidic channel. Thus, dynamic tuning of the lasing emission is possible simply by flowing liquid with different refractive indices. Moreover, as an added benefit of the liquid environment, the lasing-on-chip devices can show long-term stability because the gain molecules can be constantly refreshed. These nanoscale lasers can be mass-produced with emission wavelengths over the entire gain bandwidth of the dye. Thus, the same fixed nanocavity structure (the same gold nanoparticle array) can exhibit lasing wavelengths that can be tuned over 50 nanometers, from 860 to 910 nanometers, simply by changing the solvent the dye is dissolved in. The National Science Foundation (grants DMR-1306514 and DMR-1121262) supported the research. The title of the paper is  Real-time Tunable Lasing from Plasmonic Nanocavity Arrays.

A common tapeworm drug, already approved for use in humans, could be a new tool against MRSA. Image: NIH/NIAID The drugs both belong to a family of medicines called salicylanilide anthelmintics and they both also trounced another  gram positive  pathogen, Enterococcus faecium, in lab tests.  Since niclosamide is FDA approved and all of the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs are already out of patent, they are attractive candidates for drug repurposing and warrant further clinical investigation for treating staphylococcal infections,  wrote the lead author Rajmohan Rajamuthiah, a postdoctoral scholar in the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital. Last year the team reported that after screening more than 600 drugs against infected nematode worms, it had found that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drug closantel appeared to be protective for the worms. That led to the new research, where they tested niclosamide and oxyclozanide. Encouraging experiments In their experiments, even low concentrations of the drugs allowed more than 90 percent of MRSA-infected worms to survive, compared to less than 20 percent survival among controls. In the petri dishes the drugs cleared gaping zones of growth inhibition in MRSA culture spread over the plate, while a control substance did nothing. Between the two, oxyclozanide proved to be a more effective MRSA killer, while niclosamide effectively suppressed MRSA growth but did not completely eradicate the bacteria. Although niclosamide proved to be  bacteriostatic  instead of  bactericidal  like oxyclozanide, it may still pack plenty of punch to keep MRSA in check and give the body s immune system the upper hand, Rajamuthiah said. The researchers tested the effects of the drugs on mammalian cells, including sheep red blood cells (which fared just fine) and cancerous human liver cells (which happen to be easier to use than healthy liver cells). Niclosamide proved to be significantly toxic against the cancer cells, which other studies had shown before, but the drug is already approved for human use. The team also tested a hypothesis about how the drugs attack the bacteria. As they suspected, oxyclozanide appeared to work by disrupting the bacterial cell s membranes, but there was no sign that niclosamide worked the same way. Further testing The researchers acknowledge that petri dishes and worms are not substitutes for people, and some issues need further investigation. For example, people have been shown to clear niclosamide out of their systems quickly, and the drug does a poor job of working its way out of the bloodstream and deep into tissues.  The low level of systemic circulation coupled with the rapid elimination profile of niclosamide suggests the necessity for further testing of the potential of niclosamide and oxyclozanide for treating systemic infections,  they wrote.  Further studies should include the evaluation of these compounds in systemic and localized infection models in rodents.  Rodent experiments are being planned. But there may also be an upside to the rapid clearance, Rajamuthiah said. That might limit the toxicity of the drug, and until it is tested, it s not clear that quick clearance would undermine the drug s performance against MRSA.  Remember that no one has ever tested niclosamide for treating bacterial infections,  he said. If niclosamide, which is already used in humans for one purpose, can also help them fight off a superbug, or if its apparently more effective and less toxic cousin oxyclozanide can gain approval for human use, doctors could obtain much needed ammunition against MRSA.  The relatively mild toxicity of oxyclozanide is encouraging based on in vitro tests,  Rajamuthiah said.  Since it has never been tested in humans and since it belongs to the same structural family as niclosamide, our findings give strong impetus to using oxyclozanide for further investigations.  Particularly important is that because oxyclozanide attacks the cell membrane instead of metabolic pathways, it may be more difficult for MRSA to develop resistance, Rajamuthiah said.

What skin cancer researchers have not had -- until the present report in Nature Genetics -- is a list of genes or genetic pathways that, once altered, work with the Braf mutation to cause cancer. The mutation BrafV600E is found in 70 percent or more of benign birthmarks and moles in humans. Scientists believe the Braf mutation alone isn't enough to cause cancer. A variety of subsequent mutations identified in the present study, however, make melanomas possible. ""We want to know what exactly must happen after someone acquires this mutation in Braf that causes something even worse to happen,"" said Houston Methodist Research Institute cancer geneticist Michael Mann, Ph.D., the Nature Genetics report's lead author. ""We want to understand how this Braf mutation makes people vulnerable... susceptible to melanoma, so that we can help identify new targets for slowing or stopping growth."" The scientists used a genetic tool, a transposon called ""sleeping beauty"" that was developed by Houston Methodist cancer geneticists Nancy Jenkins, Ph.D., and Neal Copeland, Ph.D., and an animal model developed by UC San Francisco cancer geneticist Martin McMahon, Ph.D., to identify the candidate cancer genes, or CCGs, that unleash BrafV600E's terrible potential. ""By using Sleeping Beauty strategically, our group was able to identify an incredible number of genes that may cause nevi -- moles and other skin marks -- to become cancerous,"" Mann said. ""As we expected, we haven't just identified single genes that respond to the Braf mutation, but whole pathways that appear to contribute to cancer development. This is important, because if you look at it tumor by tumor, the same pathways may appear to be engaged, but not because of changes to the same genes. If you looked only at singular genes, you could miss what is really going on, biologically."" By letting Sleeping Beauty loose in the model's genome and looking for meaningful outcomes, the scientists were able to identify 1,232 altered CCGs that, with BrafV600E, led to melanomas. A comparison of human genes equivalent to those the scientists identified in mice showed that more than 500 human genes, sampled from melanoma patients, were ""enriched"" for mutations and that these mutations appeared to be related to patient survival. A genetic survey of human melanoma patients whose skin biopsies already contain BrafV600E and other relevant mutations could be helpful to oncologists in predicting patient outcomes. Last, the researchers found that one human gene, CEP350, appears to be required for tumor suppression. CEP350 had not previously been named a melanoma tumor suppressor gene. CEP350 encodes a protein believed to be crucial for cell division. Cancers of the skin are the most common form of cancer. In the U.S., the American Cancer Society estimates nearly 10,000 will die from metastatic melanomas by year's end.

It is most commonly caused by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis gene known as F508del. The disorder has no cure, and treatment typically consists of symptom management. Previous attempts to treat the disease through gene therapy have been unsuccessful. To correct the mutation, a multidisciplinary team of Yale researchers developed a novel approach. Led by Dr. Peter Glazer, chair of therapeutic radiology, Mark Saltzman, chair of biomedical engineering, and Dr. Marie Egan, professor of pediatrics and of cellular and molecular physiology, the collaborative team used synthetic molecules similar to DNA   called peptide nucleic acids, or PNAs   as well as donor DNA, to edit the genetic defect.  What the PNA does is clamp to the DNA close to the mutation, triggering DNA repair and recombination pathways in cells,  Egan explained.Left to right, cystic fibrosis cells treated with gene-correcting PNA/DNA show increasing levels of uptake, or use to correct the mutation. (Images by Rachel Fields) The researchers also developed a method of delivering the PNA/DNA via microscopic nanoparticles. These tiny particles, which are billionths of a meter in diameter, are specifically designed to penetrate targeted cells. In both human airway cells and mouse nasal cells, the researchers observed corrections in the targeted genes.  The percentage of cells in humans and in mice that we were able to edit was higher than has been previously reported in gene editing technology,  said Egan. They also observed that the therapy had minimal off target, or unintended, effects on treated cells. While the study findings are significant, much more research is needed to refine the genetic engineering strategy, said Egan.  This is step one in a long process.

The study, published online in the journal Brain, also describes a strategy for preventing the potential negative consequences of stem cell therapy.  Metastatic brain tumors   often from lung, breast, or skin cancers   are the most commonly observed tumors within the brain and account for about 30 percent of advanced breast cancer metastases,  said Khalid Shah, an HSCI principal faculty member and director of the Molecular Neurotherapy and Imaging Laboratory in the MGH Departments of Radiology and Neurology, who led the study.  Our results are the first to provide insight into ways of targeting brain metastases with stem cell-directed molecules that specifically induce the death of tumor cells, and then eliminating the therapeutic stem cells.  In their search for novel, tumor-specific therapies that could target multiple brain metastases without damaging adjacent tissues, the research team first developed a mouse model that more closely mimicked what is seen in patients. They found that injecting into the carotid artery breast cancer cells that express markers that allow them to enter the brain (cells labeled with bioluminescent and fluorescent markers to enable tracking by imaging technologies) resulted in the formation of many metastatic tumors throughout the brain, mimicking what is seen in advanced breast cancer patients. Current therapeutic options for such patients are limited, particularly when there are many metastases.Tagged therapeutic stem cells (green) targeting breast cancer metastases (red) in the brain of a mouse model. To devise a potential new therapy, the investigators engineered a population of neural stem cells to express a potent version of a gene called TRAIL, which codes for a molecule that activates cell-death-inducing receptors found only on the surface of cancer cells. Previous research by Shah and his colleagues had shown that two types of stem cells are naturally attracted toward tumors in the brain. After first verifying in their model that stem cells injected to the brain would travel to multiple metastatic sites and not to tumor-free areas, the team implanted into the brains of metastasis-bearing mice TRAIL-expressing stem cells, which reduced the growth of tumors. Injecting the TRAIL-expressing stem cells into the carotid artery, a likely strategy for clinical application, led to significantly slower tumor growth and increased survival, compared with animals receiving unaltered stem cells or control injections. The safe use of a stem cell-based therapy against brain metastasis would require preventing the engineered cells from persisting within the brain, where they could affect normal tissue and possibly give rise to new tumors. To facilitate removal of the therapeutic stem cells from the brain at the conclusion of therapy, the researchers created cells that, in addition to TRAIL, express a viral gene called HSV-TK, which renders them susceptible to the effects of the antiviral drug ganciclovir. Several tests in cultured cells indicated that ganciclovir would cause the death of HSV-TK-expressing stem cells, and testing in the mouse model confirmed that administration of the drug after successful treatment of brain metastases successfully eliminated therapeutic stem cells that also expressed HSV-TK. Shah and his team are currently developing similar animal models of brain metastasis from lung cancers and from melanoma. They also are working to improve understanding of the therapeutic efficacy of simultaneously targeting multiple tumor-specific molecules on the surface of metastatic cells within the brain and anticipate that their findings will make a major contribution toward developing novel targeted therapies for metastatic tumors in the brain. In addition to Shah, who also is an associate professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School, authors of the Brain report are co-lead authors Wanlu Du and Tugba Bagci-Onder, along with Jose-Luiz Figueiredo and Jordi Martinez-Quintanilla, all of the MGH Molecular Neurotherapy and Imaging Laboratory.

This set of diseases affect mitochondria, tiny powerhouses that generate energy in the body s cells and are passed exclusively from mother to child. Women wishing to prevent their children from inheriting mitochondrial diseases have typically relied on preimplantation genetic diagnosis to pick the healthiest embryos, but that is no guarantee of having a healthy baby. Now, researchers at Salk Institute have developed a simple technique to eliminate mitochondrial mutations from eggs or early embryos, which has the potential to prevent babies from inheriting mitochondrial diseases. Their approach is described in the April 23, 2015 issue of Cell.  Currently, there are no treatments for mitochondrial diseases,  says senior author Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, professor in Salk s Gene Expression Laboratory and holder of the Roger Guillemin Chair.  Our technology may offer new hope for mitochondrial disease carriers wishing to have children without the disease.  Living cells can have hundreds or even thousands of mitochondria, each of which contains their own DNA, a small collection of 37 genes that are essential for the organelle s function. Mutations in these crucial genes can cause a wide range of diseases and can lead to fatality at birth, a life expectancy of only a few years or devastating symptoms for decades.    Most current approaches are trying to develop treatments for patients who are already suffering from these diseases,  says Alejandro Ocampo, a research associate in Izpisua Belmonte s lab and one of the first authors of the paper.  Instead, we thought of preventing the transmission of these mutations early in development.  Izpisua Belmonte and his colleagues turned to two types of molecules: restriction endonucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). These nucleases can be engineered to cut specific strands of DNA, functioning as a type of molecular  scissors.  The Salk team designed nucleases to cut only mitochondrial DNA that contained specific, disease-causing mutations in eggs or embryos, leaving healthy mitochondria intact.  We might not be able to eliminate one hundred percent of the mutated copies of mitochondrial DNA,  says Pradeep Reddy, another research associate in the Izpisua Belmonte lab and first author of the new paper.  But you don t need to eliminate all of the mutated copies: just reducing the percentage significantly enough can prevent the disease in the next generation.  As proof of concept, the scientists, using mice containing two types of mitochondrial DNA, selectively prevented the transmission of one of the types to the next generation using specific nucleases in both eggs and one-cell embryos. Baby mice generated by this approach developed normally to adulthood. In addition, this method let the researchers successfully reduce the levels of mutated mitochondrial DNA responsible for two human mitochondrial diseases. In the United Kingdom, lawmakers have recently approved the use of another technology known as mitochondrial replacement to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases. This technology is based on the transfer of the nuclear genome from one patient s embryo into donor embryos with healthy mitochondria.  The clinical application of our technique does not require donor eggs,  says Ocampo.  We are just performing a single injection into the patient s egg or one-cell embryo, which is technically easier than mitochondrial replacement.  Izpisua Belmonte and colleagues are now investigating the possibility of translating this technology to the clinic in human eggs and embryos.

The analysis provides crucial information about the structure and function of this complex muscle protein and could lead to the development of new treatments for major muscular disorders. The results of the project, which is funded by the Austrian Science Fund FWF and the European Commission, were recently published in the prestigious scientific journal Cell. Muscles move many things   but first and foremost themselves. Filaments of special proteins pull against each other so that the muscle can exert force. This only works if there is a fixed point, which anchors the filaments. These locations are known as Z-disks and are largely composed of the protein  -actinin. An international research team headed by Kristina Djinovic-Carugo from the Max F. Perutz Laboratories of the University of Vienna and Medical University of Vienna has taken a closer look at this protein. Function Follows Form ""We not only succeeded in describing the exact structure of the protein for the first time"", explains Djinovic-Carugo, ""we were also able to confirm the long-held assumption about how its function is regulated."" It emerged from the structural research that showed that  -actinin exists as a dimer, a complex consisting of two identical molecules, and that it displays a cylindrical shape, 360   in length (1   = 10-10 metres) and 60   wide. Each individual molecule of the dimer has a head-and a neck-like structure followed by a four-part rod-shaped extension. Two protein domains protruding from the rod-shaped extension in an L-shaped formation proved to be particularly interesting. ""These L-shaped domains connect to the neck of the other molecule and this interaction is important for function"", describes Djinovic-Carugo. ""However, the really exciting discovery about these domains arose when we added the fatty acid molecule PIP2."" Scientists had actually speculated for years that PIP2 plays a key role in the functioning of muscle  -actinin. This hypothesis remained unconfirmed, however, until the following observation was made during the study of Djinovic-Carugo and her international colleagues in Germany, United Kingdom, Norway, Russia, Switzerland and Slovenia: as long as there is no PIP2 available, the L-shaped domain remains connected to the neck of the second  -actinin. If PIP2 is available, the connection opens and renders the domain available to bind to another muscle protein   titin. The trick here   as revealed by the structural data from this FWF project   is that the neck region of the  -actinin is similar in structure to titin. If there is no PIP2, one of the L-shaped domain of an  -actinin molecule binds to a titin-lookalike region in the neck of the opposing molecule. If PIP2 is present, the L-shaped part detaches from the neck and binds titin. The presence of PIP2 is sufficient to change the binding parameters in such a way that the one is prioritised over the other. X-ray View of The Crystal Ball Regarding the methodology used in the study, Djinovic-Carugo says: ""To deduce the functioning of a protein from its structure, you have to be able to identify everything down to a billionth of a metre. This is only really possible using X-ray diffraction, in which X-ray beams diffract when they encounter the fine structures of a protein, which is presented in the form of a crystal."" However, the decision to use this technology involved a tough test of the scientists  patience at the outset: it took years to produce sufficient amounts of  -actinin to grow the protein crystals. The clarification of how  -actinin is regulated by PIP2 necessitated the use of other complicated complementary analysis methods, and this is where the expertise of Djinovic-Carugo s international colleagues was indispensable. The comprehensive findings, which were recently acknowledged through the publication of the study in Cell, show that the long and concerted effort was worthwhile. The importance of the project s results extends far beyond the basic insights they provide.  -Actinin plays a role in the causes of life-threatening muscular disorders like dystrophies and cardiomyopathies. The new insights into the structure and function of this protein could lead to the development of new approaches to their treatment.","Published: April 27, 2015"

A new device developed at MIT may change that. The implantable device, about the size of the grain of rice, can carry small doses of up to 30 different drugs. After implanting it in a tumor and letting the drugs diffuse into the tissue, researchers can measure how effectively each one kills the patient s cancer cells. Such a device could eliminate much of the guesswork now involved in choosing cancer treatments, says Oliver Jonas, a postdoc at MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and lead author of a paper describing the device in the April 22 online edition of Science Translational Medicine.  You can use it to test a patient for a range of available drugs, and pick the one that works best,  Jonas says. The paper s senior authors are Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Professor at MIT and a member of the Koch Institute, the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, and the Department of Chemical Engineering; and Michael Cima, the David H. Koch Professor of Engineering at MIT and a member of the Koch Institute and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. Putting the lab in the patient Most of the commonly used cancer drugs work by damaging DNA or otherwise interfering with cell function. Recently, scientists have also developed more targeted drugs designed to kill tumor cells that carry a specific genetic mutation. However, it is usually difficult to predict whether a particular drug will be effective in an individual patient. In some cases, doctors extract tumor cells, grow them in a lab dish, and treat them with different drugs to see which ones are most effective. However, this process removes the cells from their natural environment, which can play an important role in how a tumor responds to drug treatment, Jonas says.  The approach that we thought would be good to try is to essentially put the lab into the patient,  he says.  It s safe and you can do all of your sensitivity testing in the native microenvironment.  The device, made from a stiff, crystalline polymer, can be implanted in a patient s tumor using a biopsy needle. After implantation, drugs seep 200 to 300 microns into the tumor, but do not overlap with each other. Any type of drug can go into the reservoir, and the researchers can formulate the drugs so that the doses that reach the cancer cells are similar to what they would receive if the drug were given by typical delivery methods such as intravenous injection. After one day of drug exposure, the implant is removed, along with a small sample of the tumor tissue surrounding it, and the researchers analyze the drug effects by slicing up the tissue sample and staining it with antibodies that can detect markers of cell death or proliferation. Ranking cancer drugs To test the device, the researchers implanted it in mice that had been grafted with human prostate, breast, and melanoma tumors. These tumors are known to have varying sensitivity to different cancer drugs, and the MIT team s results corresponded to those previously seen differences. The researchers then tested the device with a type of breast cancer known as triple negative, which lacks the three most common breast cancer markers: estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Her2. This form of cancer is particularly aggressive, and none of the drugs used against it are targeted to a specific genetic marker. Using the device, the researchers found that triple negative tumors responded differently to five of the drugs commonly used to treat them. The most effective was paclitaxel, followed by doxorubicin, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and lapatinib. They found the same results when delivering these drugs by intravenous injection, suggesting that the device is an accurate predictor of drug sensitivity. In this study, the researchers compared single drugs to each other, but the device could also be used to test different drug combinations by putting two or three drugs into the same reservoir, Jonas says.  This device could help us identify the best chemotherapy agents and combinations for every tumor prior to starting systemic administration of chemotherapy, as opposed to making choices based on population-based statistics. This has been a longstanding pursuit of the oncology community and an important step toward our goal of developing precision-based cancer therapy,  says Jose Baselga, chief medical officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and an author of the paper. The researchers are now working on ways to make the device easier to read while it is still inside the patient, allowing them to get results faster. They are also planning to launch a clinical trial in breast cancer patients next year.  This is a stunning advance in the approach to treating complex cancers,  says Henry Brem, a professor of neurosurgery and oncology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who was not involved in the research.  This work is transformative in that it now opens the doors to truly personalized medicine with the right drug or drug combination being utilized for each tumor.  Another possible application for this device is to guide the development and testing of new cancer drugs. Researchers could create several different variants of a promising compound and test them all at once in a small trial of human patients, allowing them to choose the best one to carry on to a larger clinical trial. The research was funded by Kibur Medical and the National Cancer Institute.

In fact, preliminary results show 12 percent greater on-task engagement in classrooms with standing desks, which equates to an extra seven minutes per hour of engaged instruction time. The findings, published in the International Journal of Health Promotion and Education, were based on a study of almost 300 children in second through fourth grade who were observed over the course of a school year. Engagement was measured by on-task behaviors such as answering a question, raising a hand or participating in active discussion and off-task behaviors like talking out of turn. Standing desks -- also known as stand-biased desks -- are raised desks that have stools nearby, enabling students to sit or stand during class at their discretion. Mark Benden, Ph.D., CPE, associate professor at the Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Public Health, who is an ergonomic engineer by trade, originally became interested in the desks as a means to reduce childhood obesity and relieve stress on spinal structures that may occur with traditional desks. Lessons learned from his research in this area led to creation of Stand2Learn , an offshoot company of a faculty-led startup that manufactures a classroom version of the stand-biased desk. Benden's previous studies have shown the desks can help reduce obesity -- with students at standing desks burning 15 percent more calories than students at traditional desks (25 percent for obese children) -- and there was anecdotal evidence that the desks also increased engagement. The latest study was the first designed specifically to look at the impact of classroom engagement. Benden said he was not surprised at the results of the study, given that previous research has shown that physical activity, even at low levels, may have beneficial effects on cognitive ability. ""Standing workstations reduce disruptive behavior problems and increase students' attention or academic behavioral engagement by providing students with a different method for completing academic tasks (like standing) that breaks up the monotony of seated work,"" Benden said. ""Considerable research indicates that academic behavioral engagement is the most important contributor to student achievement. Simply put, we think better on our feet than in our seat."" The key takeaway from this research, Benden said, is that school districts that put standing desks in classrooms may be able to address two problems at the same time: academic performance and childhood obesity.

In a study from Sweden's Karolinska Institutet, a team of neuroscientists now reports a perceptual illusion of having an invisible body, and show that the feeling of invisibility changes our physical stress response in challenging social situations. The history of literature features many well-known narrations of invisibility and its effect on the human mind, such as the myth of Gyges' ring in Plato's dialogue The Republic and the science fiction novel The Invisible Man by H.G. Wells. Recent advances in materials science have shown that invisibility cloaking of large-scale objects, such as a human body, might be possible in the not-so-distant future; however, it remains unknown how invisibility would affect our brain and body perception. In an article in the journal Scientific Reports, the researchers describe a perceptual illusion of having an invisible body. The experiment involves the participant standing up and wearing a set of head-mounted displays. The participant is then asked to look down at her body, but instead of her real body she sees empty space. To evoke the feeling of having an invisible body, the scientist touches the participant's body in various locations with a large paintbrush while, with another paintbrush held in the other hand, exactly imitating the movements in mid-air in full view of the participant. ""Within less than a minute, the majority of the participants started to transfer the sensation of touch to the portion of empty space where they saw the paintbrush move and experienced an invisible body in that position,"" says Arvid Guterstam, lead author of the present study. ""We showed in a previous study that the same illusion can be created for a single hand. The present study demonstrates that the 'invisible hand illusion' can, surprisingly, be extended to an entire invisible body."" The study examined the illusion experience in 125 participants. To demonstrate that the illusion actually worked, the researchers would make a stabbing motion with a knife toward the empty space that represented the belly of the invisible body. The participants' sweat response to seeing the knife was elevated while experiencing the illusion but absent when the illusion was broken, which suggests that the brain interprets the threat in empty space as a threat directed toward one's own body. In another part of the study, the researchers examined whether the feeling of invisibility affects social anxiety by placing the participants in front of an audience of strangers. ""We found that their heart rate and self-reported stress level during the 'performance' was lower when they immediately prior had experienced the invisible body illusion compared to when they experienced having a physical body,"" says Arvid Guterstam. ""These results are interesting because they show that the perceived physical quality of the body can change the way our brain processes social cues."" The researches hope that the results of the study will be of value to future clinical research, for example in the development of new therapies for social anxiety disorder. ""Follow-up studies should also investigate whether the feeling of invisibility affects moral decision-making, to ensure that future invisibility cloaking does not make us lose our sense of right and wrong, which Plato asserted over two millennia ago,"" says principal investigator Dr. Henrik Ehrsson, professor at the Department of Neuroscience.

You are driving to work, late for an important meeting. You are almost there when you have to stop at a red light. When will you begin inching forward? Doing it too early will result in wasting gas and energy, but doing it at the right time will get you to work faster. Estimating the right moment to perform an action critically depends on our innate ability to track time. What is the neural mechanism that underlies this capacity? ""We know that for actions to have successful outcomes, the brain has to keep track of time"", says Dr. Joe Paton, head of the Learning Lab at the Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme. ""Time is implicit in nature, difficult to tease apart from the on-going behavioral and sensory context, which makes studying it quite challenging."" To pin down this elusive quantity, the researchers focused on the striatum brain region. ""Many lines of evidence implicate the striatum as a site of timing information"", says Dr. Paton, ""as many conditions that affect the striatum, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, result in timing dysfunction."" Gustavo Mello, a graduate student in the lab explains how they tested timing behavior in rats: ""The rats performed a timing task where they had to press a lever to receive a reward, which was available periodically. For example, during a sequence of 15 trials, the reward would only become available after 30 seconds had passed since the last reward. To see whether the rat would be able to estimate different durations, after those 15 trials, the waiting time would change randomly to be either shorter, or longer."" The researchers found that the rats changed their behavior according to the different waiting times. ""Similarly to how we would behave when waiting at a red light, the rats also seemed to prefer not to waste their energy and pressed the lever only when enough time has passed"", says Mr. Mello. To find out what is the neural basis that underlies this behavior, the researchers recorded the activity of individual neurons in the striatum while the rats were performing the task, finding that the representation of time was coded across the population of neurons. ""We found that each time a trial started, the neurons responded in a slow but reliable wave of sequential activity,"" says Sofia Soares, a graduate student in the lab. ""The sequence was conserved across different waiting durations, but changed its timing. In other words, when the waiting time was longer, the sequence was slower and vice versa. Hence, the sequence was shrinking and expanding in a way that corresponded to the current interval between rewards and the behavior of the animal. You could essentially just look at the location of the wave within the population to read out how much time had passed."" What does the shrinking and expanding of the sequence mean about the way the brain keeps track of time? According to Mr. Mello: ""The implication is that time in the brain is relative, not absolute, as it is measured as a position within an interval and not as a unit, such as a second, or an hour."" ""This is the first time the full diversity of response dynamics in the striatum was considered during a timing task"", concludes Dr. Paton, ""allowing us to demonstrate that populations of neurons encode time in a manner that is consistent with timing behavior. In addition, we found that the neurons combined motor and timing information. This composition of time and actions is consistent with motor learning and action selection, functions in which the striatum plays a critical role.""

Research from the University of Florida and London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine found, for the first time, an underlying genetic component to how attractive we are to mosquitoes and this is likely to be caused by genetic control of our body odor. Although this was a pilot study, it provides exciting information which may allow us to understand more about how our intimate relationship with mosquitoes has evolved. Ultimately the finding could result in the development of better ways to control mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit.  Genetics, and particularly quantitative genetics, is currently an exciting field where we constantly find new applications and developments that have, and will have, implications on our daily life,  said study co-author Salvador Gezan, an assistant professor of quantitative genetics and biometrics at the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.  With this study, we have unmasked interesting genetic control of attractiveness to mosquitoes. This is a step forward to the developing of tools aimed at our personal genotyping.  The findings are published in PLOS ONE and build on previous research where it was shown that attractiveness to insects is based on differences in body odor. People who are less attractive to mosquitoes produce natural repellents. It seems that this trait is genetically controlled. A series of trials using 18 identical and 19 non-identical female twins showed that identical twin pairs were more similar in attractiveness to mosquitoes than non-identical twin pairs. The extent to which genes play a part - the level of heritability - in the trait for being attractive or not to mosquitoes was found to be at a similar level (0.83) as that associated with height (0.8) and IQ (0.5-0.8). Funded by the Sir Halley Stewart Trust, the pilot study was carried out in collaboration with the University of Nottingham and Rothamsted Research. Twins UK assisted with recruitment of the sets of twins. In the experiment, Aedes aegypti, dengue mosquitoes, were released into a Y-shaped tube which divides into two sections. They were allowed to fly down either side towards the odor from the study participants  hands to see which twin they were most attracted to. Female mosquitoes display preferences for the smell of certain people when they choose who to bite to feed on the blood which they require to reproduce. For example, pregnant women are more attractive to Anopheles gambiae (the principal malaria vector in Africa) than their non-pregnant counterparts, and people with a greater body mass also appear to be more attractive to mosquitoes and midges. Diet is often suggested as an explanation, with anecdotes about eating garlic or drinking beer to keep mosquitoes away. However, there is no clear and consistent dietary explanation.  By investigating the genetic mechanism behind attractiveness to biting insects such as mosquitoes we can move closer to using this knowledge for better ways of keeping us safe from bites and the diseases insects can spread through bites,  said senior author James Logan, senior lecturer in medical entomology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.  If we understand the genetic basis for variation between individuals it could be possible to develop bespoke ways to control mosquitoes better, and develop new ways to repel them. In the future we may even be able to take a pill which will enhance the production of natural repellents by the body and ultimately replace skin lotions. ","Published: April 24, 2015"

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/a-new-wrinkle-for-cell-culture-186576,A New Wrinkle For Cell Culture Researchers at Brown University have developed an advanced technique for cell culturing that uses sheets of wrinkled graphene to mimic the complex   D environment inside the body  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Using a technique that introduces tiny wrinkles into sheets of graphene, researchers from Brown University have developed new textured surfaces for culturing cells in the lab that better mimic the complex surroundings in which cells grow in the body.  We know that cells are shaped by their surroundings,  said Ian Y. Wong, assistant professor of engineering and one of the study s authors.  We ve shown that you can make textured environments for cell culture fairly easily using graphene.  Traditionally, cell culture in the lab has been done in petri dishes and on other flat surfaces. But in the body, cells grow in considerably more complex environments. Research has shown that a cell s physical surroundings can influence its shape, physiology, and even the expression of its genes. That has led scientists in the last decade or so to look for ways of culturing cells in laboratory settings that are a bit more complex. Making surfaces with textures small enough to be relevant at the cellular scale isn t easy, however. So the Brown team turned to a darling of the nanotech world: graphene, the carbon nanomaterial. To make their textured surfaces, the researchers used graphene oxide dispersed in a solution and dabbed onto a substrate made from a rubbery silicon material. Before applying the graphene, tension is applied to the substrate to stretch it out like a rubber band. When the graphene dries, the tension is released and the substrate snaps back to its normal size. When that happens, tiny wrinkles   ridges just a few microns high and spaced a few microns apart   form in the graphene layer atop the substrate. The size of the wrinkles can be controlled by the concentration of the graphene solution and the extent of the substrate stretching. A more concentrated solution increases the spacing between the wrinkle ridges. More stretching increases the height of the wrinkles. Part of the beauty of these surfaces is the ease with which they can be made, says Mehrdad Kiani, a Brown undergraduate student and member of the research team.  Other methods are much more labor-intensive,  Kiani said.  With this method, you can take a long piece of rubber substrate, stretch it out, and place many droplets at once.  The long ribbon can then be cut into small rectangles, which can be placed in multiwell plates for lab experiments. Once they had their wrinkled surfaces, the researchers  next step was to see whether those wrinkles influenced the growth of cells cultured on the surfaces. In a study published recently in the journal Carbon, the team grew human and mouse fibroblast cells (cells involved in wound healing) on flat graphene sheets and on wrinkled ones. The study revealed major differences in how cells grew on each of the surfaces.  On the flat graphene, the cells were disorganized, multipolar and not aligned,  said Evelyn Kendall Williams, another undergraduate member of the research team.  But on the wrinkled surface, the cells were elongated and highly aligned along the wrinkles. These morphological features are more indicative of a biologically relevant phenotype.  In the body, fibroblasts grow in the nooks and crannies of connective tissue. They tend to have a long, spindly appearance similar to the look of the cells that grew in the graphene wrinkles. Having shown that their wrinkled surface can influence the shape of cells, the researchers will continue to do experiments with wrinkles of different shapes and sizes. These surfaces make that possible because the wrinkles themselves are easily tunable.  We think this is a great new way to understand how cells  growth is influenced by their physical surroundings,  Wong said. The surfaces could also be used to test drugs in the lab, Wong says, or perhaps as biomimetic surfaces for implantable tissue scaffolds or neural implants. The work was the result of collaboration between Wong s biomedical engineering lab and the lab of Robert Hurt, professor of engineering at Brown, who focuses on carbon nanomaterials.  This is a new application for graphene,  Hurt said.  We are just beginning to realize all of the innovative ways one can use this atomically thin and flexible building block to make new materials and devices.  The team recently received seed funding from Brown s Office of the Vice President for Research to continue the work. Kiani and Williams both received undergraduate research funding from Brown to work on the project during the summer of 2014. Kiani was funded through the Vincent and Ruby DiMase Undergraduate Summer Fellowship offered through the Brown School of Engineering. Williams received a Karen T. Romer Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award. Graduate students Zhongying Wang, Daniel Tonderys, Susan E. Leggett, Ruben Spitz Steinberg, and Yang Qiu were coauthors on the paper. The initial work was supported by the National Science Foundation (CBET-1132446 and CBET-1344097) and National Institutes of Health (5T32ES007272-23); Wong received seed funding from Jason and Donna McGraw Weiss.

Studying mouse and cell models of this process, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis now have shown how immune cells dispatched to the lung to destroy a respiratory virus can fail to disperse after their job is finished, setting off a chain of inflammatory events that leads to long-term lung problems. Understanding such details may help scientists find ways to block the accumulation of inflammatory immune cells and prevent progression to chronic lung disorders. The study appears April 20 in The Journal of Experimental Medicine. The findings stem from research into immune cells called macrophages.  In general, scientists thought this type of macrophage was involved in the repair of the lung,  said senior author Michael J. Holtzman, MD, the Selma and Herman Seldin Professor of Medicine at the School of Medicine.  That may be true in some cases. But like many things in nature, too much of a good thing can become a bad thing.  When large numbers of this type of macrophage accumulate, they appear to stop orchestrating the immune response against acute viral infections and instead participate in a type of response that is more typically directed against parasites and allergens. Holtzman and his colleagues observed that macrophages producing this type of immune response also express a protein called TREM-2 at high levels. The new work shows that the usual cell-surface form of TREM-2 is indeed needed to sustain the macrophages as they fight off viral infection and the early illness it causes. Then, after the initial infection is cleared, TREM-2 is cleaved from the outer surface of the macrophages. Previously, this cleaved form of the protein was thought to be inactive.  We were surprised to find that this cleaved form of TREM-2 is actually quite active,  Holtzman said.  It potently prevents the programmed death of macrophages, promoting their survival. So this form of TREM-2 allows for macrophages to hang around longer than they should.  Holtzman noted that TREM-2 enables a feed-forward process for inflammatory disease. Each new infection activates macrophages, which later produce the cleaved form of TREM-2. This form then promotes further macrophage accumulation and ultimately contributes to ongoing and progressive inflammatory disease. Implicating TREM-2 in the harmful accumulation of inflammatory immune cells opens the door to exploring ways to block it, according to first author Kangyun Wu, PhD, a staff scientist.  We don t yet have a specific drug to interrupt the TREM-2 process,  Holtzman said.  But we now understand the controls for the process, so our drug discovery program is already screening for compounds that might keep TREM-2 at normal levels.  The researchers also found that the cleaved form of TREM-2 that causes the macrophages to stick around when they shouldn t does not appear to be involved in the initial immune response to the acute viral infection. So presumably, blocking it should not interfere with the important task of clearing the respiratory virus from the lungs. Holtzman also pointed out that individual genetic variation in TREM-2 may explain why some people never develop chronic lung disease even after many viral lung infections. While this study focused on the lung, Holtzman said TREM-2 could be involved in other inflammatory diseases in which the immune system is chronically activated in other organs. He pointed to a possible role in the brain, for example, since related work has associated certain genetic variants of TREM-2 and macrophage dysfunction with Alzheimer s disease.","Published: April 24, 2015"

Currently, 90% of existing vaccines are cold-chain dependent, and the goal of the consortium is to develop a scalable manufacturing process for vaccines that are stable and temperature independent. A total project fund of  5.3 million has been awarded as part of Horizon 2020, the European Union research and innovation framework program, with additional funding of up to  3.1 million from the Swiss State Secretariat Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) for the Swiss based consortium partners, resulting in a total project grant of  8.4 million (USD8.9 million). The EU Horizon 2020 project is named MACIVIVA, which stands for  Manufacturing process for Cold-chain Independent Virosome-based Vaccines . The project duration is in total 3.5 years and brings together world class expertise in the field of virosome vaccines, manufacturing, spray drying, freeze drying and analytical techniques from the pharmaceutical industry. Catalent s Swindon, UK facility, the manufacturing hub of its Zydis fast-dissolve formulation technology, will receive a portion of the total fund with the balance being distributed amongst the other consortium partners: Mymetics SA (Switzerland), Mymetics BV (Netherlands); Chimera Biotech Gmbh (Germany); Upperton Ltd. (UK); and Bachem AG (Switzerland).  Catalent is pleased to be part of this consortium of cross-industry partners bringing innovative technologies together to address a serious global issue in the over-reliance on the cold chain with existing vaccines,  commented Barry Littlejohns, Catalent s President of Advanced Delivery Technologies.  Zydis is the world s best-in-class, orally disintegrating tablet technology, and we believe our experience and expertise in this area can add substantially to the project as a whole. Because of the supply chain constraints, large populations are denied access to vaccines, so we, as a group, recognize the importance and potential of this work for global vaccine development.  The MACIVIVA project will receive funding from the European Union s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 646122.","Published: April 24, 2015"

Every time you make a memory, somewhere in your brain a tiny filament reaches out from one neuron and forms an electrochemical connection to a neighboring neuron. A team of biologists at Vanderbilt University, headed by Associate Professor of Biological Sciences Donna Webb, studies how these connections are formed at the molecular and cellular level. The filaments that make these new connections are called dendritic spines and, in a series of experiments described in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, the researchers report that a specific signaling protein, Asef2, a member of a family of proteins that regulate cell migration and adhesion, plays a critical role in spine formation. This is significant because Asef2 has been linked to autism and the co-occurrence of alcohol dependency and depression. ""Alterations in dendritic spines are associated with many neurological and developmental disorders, such as autism, Alzheimer's disease and Down Syndrome,"" said Webb. ""However, the formation and maintenance of spines is a very complex process that we are just beginning to understand."" Neuron cell bodies produce two kinds of long fibers that weave through the brain: dendrites and axons. Axons transmit electrochemical signals from the cell body of one neuron to the dendrites of another neuron. Dendrites receive the incoming signals and carry them to the cell body. This is the way that neurons communicate with each other. As they wait for incoming signals, dendrites continually produce tiny flexible filaments called filopodia. These poke out from the surface of the dendrite and wave about in the region between the cells searching for axons. At the same time, biologists think that the axons secrete chemicals of an unknown nature that attract the filopodia. When one of the dendritic filaments makes contact with one of the axons, it begins to adhere and to develop into a spine. The axon and spine form the two halves of a synaptic junction. New connections like this form the basis for memory formation and storage. Autism has been associated with immature spines, which do not connect properly with axons to form new synaptic junctions. However, a reduction in spines is characteristic of the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. This may help explain why individuals with Alzheimer's have trouble forming new memories. The formation of spines is driven by actin, a protein that produces microfilaments and is part of the cytoskeleton. Webb and her colleagues showed that Asef2 promotes spine and synapse formation by activating another protein called Rac, which is known to regulate actin activity. They also discovered that yet another protein, spinophilin, recruits Asef2 and guides it to specific spines. ""Once we figure out the mechanisms involved, then we may be able to find drugs that can restore spine formation in people who have lost it, which could give them back their ability to remember,"" said Webb.

Now, researchers reporting in the Cell Press journal Current Biology have taken advantage of a rare opportunity to record directly from the brain of a person with tinnitus in order to find the brain networks responsible. The observations reveal just how different tinnitus is from normal representations of sounds in the brain. ""Perhaps the most remarkable finding was that activity directly linked to tinnitus was very extensive, and spanned a large proportion of the part of the brain we measured from,"" says Will Sedley of Newcastle University. ""In contrast, the brain responses to a sound we played that mimicked [the subject's] tinnitus were localized to just a tiny area.""In the new study, Sedley and The University of Iowa's Phillip Gander contrasted brain activity during periods when tinnitus was relatively stronger and weaker. The study was only possible because the 50-year-old man they studied required invasive electrode monitoring for epilepsy. He also happened to have a typical pattern of tinnitus, including ringing in both ears, in association with hearing loss. ""It is such a rarity that a person requiring invasive electrode monitoring for epilepsy also has tinnitus that we aim to study every such person if they are willing,"" Gander says. The researchers found the expected tinnitus-linked brain activity, but they report that the unusual activity extended far beyond circumscribed auditory cortical regions to encompass almost all of the auditory cortex, along with other parts of the brain. The discovery adds to the understanding of tinnitus and helps to explain why treatment has proven to be such a challenge, the researchers say. ""We now know that tinnitus is represented very differently in the brain to normal sounds, even ones that sound the same, and therefore these cannot necessarily be used as the basis for understanding tinnitus or targeting treatment,"" Sedley says. ""The sheer amount of the brain across which the tinnitus network is present suggests that tinnitus may not simply 'fill in' the 'gap' left by hearing damage, but also actively infiltrates beyond this into wider brain systems,"" Gander adds. These new insights may help to inform treatments such as neurofeedback, where patients learn to control their ""brainwaves,"" or electromagnetic brain stimulation, according to the researchers. A better understanding of the brain patterns associated with tinnitus may also help point toward new pharmacological approaches to treatment, ""which have so far generally been disappointing.""

Munich researchers now combine two competing classical theories of magnitude estimates. How long is the way from the city hall to the train station? When we estimate distances, something curious happens: short distances seem longer, and long distances shorter than they really are. Similar biases occur during judgments of volume, brightness or time. Psychologists call this phenomenon Vierordt s law. Its independence of the involved sensory systems suggests that our brain possesses universal principles for the assessment of physical quantities. However, where do the characteristic estimation biases stem from? In collaboration with colleagues from Zurich, neuroscientists at the Bernstein Center Munich and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich provide a new explanatory model, in which previous experience holds an important role.  Our approach is based on probability theory and allows to reinterpret and combine two seemingly contradictory classic theories,  explains Stefan Glasauer, one of the authors of the study. The first theory of magnitude estimation is the Weber-Fechner law proposed in 1860. Some 100 years later, Stanley Smith Stevens introduced a power law and asserted that it was incompatible with the Weber-Fechner law. This opinion is now disproved:  Using Bayes  theorem from classical probability theory, both theories can be integrated into a new model,  Glasauer says. In contrast to the previous approaches, the new model of the brain researchers also takes into account how prior knowledge affects the judgment of physical quantities.  We automatically gain experience with each magnitude estimation. This knowledge certainly affects subsequent estimates and is one of the causes leading to systematic estimation biases,  Glasauer explains. In the process, learning occurs unconsciously and requires no feedback on the success of the assessment.  We hope that our approach will serve to better understand the neurobiological mechanisms of magnitude judgments,  Glasauer concludes.

For someone with a compromised immune system, it can mean death, following an excruciating, protracted bout of watery diarrhea. Recently, researchers at Fudan University's Institute of Biomedical Sciences in Shanghai developed a lab-on-a-chip device that can rapidly diagnose cryptosporidium infections from just a finger prick -- potentially bringing point-of-care diagnosis to at-risk areas in rural China in order to improve treatment outcomes. Worldwide, treatment for the parasitic infection consists largely of oral rehydration and managing symptoms until the body clears the infection, something that may take far longer for people with HIV infections. Currently, China has more than 780,000 people living with HIV/AIDS, but there is very little data on how many of them are living with Cryptosporidium infections. This stems from the difficulties of diagnosing an infection in the field -- poor sensitivity and a short window of spore secretion both limit the viability of acid-fast staining, a standard diagnostic assay in use today. More advanced immunoassays, such as ELISA, are difficult to use broadly because they require relatively advanced lab settings and skilled technicians. To address this need, Xunjia Cheng and Guodong Sui, both professors at Fudan University, sought to develop a device better suited for the field. Cheng's research has involved medical protozoa and opportunistic HIV infections, and Sui's lab focuses on microfluidics. This week in the journal Biomicrofluidics, from AIP Publishing, they describe how they developed and tested the new microfluidic device as the fruit of this collaboration. The microfluidic chip was designed by AutoCad software and manufactured from a widely used silicon-based organic polymer known as PDMS. It consists of functional valves, pumps and columns, collectively sitting at the heart of a platform of reagent cartridges, an injection pump, a fluorescence microscope and a digital camera. The chip itself is small -- 3 cm by 2 cm -- and only costs about a dollar to manufacture, according to Sui. The microfluidic device tests for the presence of the parasites' P23 antigen, a major molecular target of host antibody responses against the pathogen's infective stages. The device is easy to use, allowing just about anybody to operate it, Sui and Cheng said. It can process up to five samples at a time, and the entire detection process can be completed in 10 minutes with only two microliters of blood -- less than the volume of a typical mustard seed. Sui and Cheng tested their device's efficacy at diagnosing Cryptosporidium infections in 190 HIV-infected patients in Guangxi, China. They found that the device's diagnostic capabilities were on par with those of ELISA - essentially giving users a device that's as effective as the current diagnostic standard, with huge potential reductions in cost, timeframe, size and the amount of training needed to operate. Future work for Sui and Cheng involves expanding the chip's sample processing capacities to include other infectious diseases, as well as increasing the device's sensitivity and specificity.","Published: April 23, 2015"

NIST's guide, Biological Evidence Preservation: Considerations for Policy Makers, encourages legislators, judges, law enforcement officials, crime laboratory managers and other policy makers to implement or update laws that support best practices in this critical area. ""While 43 states and the District of Columbia have enacted statutes related to the preservation of biological evidence, policies and procedures can be enacted in states that currently have no laws,"" as well as states looking to improve existing legislation, according to the NIST report. Biological evidence refers to two types of evidence commonly recovered from crime scenes or collected during criminal investigations: biological samples such as blood, semen and other bodily fluids; hair; tissue; bones and teeth; or items containing biological material such as a bloody T-shirt. An earlier NIST report, The Biological Evidence Preservation Handbook: Best Practices for Evidence Handlers, detailed a set of best practices to help ensure biological evidence is properly stored to avoid contamination, protected against premature destruction or degradation, and accurately tracked to prevent loss. The new guide for policy makers discusses key issues that influence and drive policies in this area. Based on a thorough examination of existing state statutes, current trends, law, scientific literature and expert opinions, the authors make nine recommendations for actions that support best practices for preserving biological evidence. ""Biological evidence can carry a lot of weight in solving crimes, but if you can't find it or find it in an unusable state, it won't help you conduct the necessary forensic analyses to administer justice fairly,"" said Shannan Williams, project manager in the NIST Forensic Science Research Program. Among the report's policy recommendations are that each state require:  The establishment of an authoritative body to define and enforce standards related to biological evidence preservation;  Biological evidence be stored in appropriate environmental conditions, based on known scientific practices;  Evidence be retained according to timetables based on the type of crime and the status of the case; and  A means for defendants or petitioners to seek recourse in cases where it has been judicially determined that a denial of access to biological evidence has occurred. Both reports were authored by the Technical Working Group on Biological Evidence Preservation, a group of 20 experts from various forensic, law enforcement and scientific disciplines, as well as legal scholars, medical personnel and representatives of relevant professional organizations. The National Commission on Forensic Science, coordinated by the Department of Justice and NIST, has chosen to address this topic through the creation of an Evidence Retention and Preservation Working Group. The working group is developing a document that will summarize the status of scientific and legal issues surrounding the retention and preservation of biological as well as non-biological evidence. The commission plans to discuss policies to support best practices for biological evidence preservation at its meeting in Washington, D.C., from April 30-May 1, 2015. Williams will present the new NIST report to the commission during the meeting.

In the study, reported in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 14-year-old subjects completed a simulated driving task while researchers tracked blood flow in their brains. In one trial, the teen driver was alone; in another, the teen's mother was present and watching, said University of Illinois psychology professor Eva Telzer , who led the study. Laurence Steinberg, a professor of psychology at Temple University, developed the driving task and evaluated how the presence of peers influenced teen risk-taking, Telzer said. ""He found that peers significantly increase risk-taking among teens,"" Telzer said. ""I wanted to know whether we could reduce risk-taking by bringing a parent into the car."" Telzer and her colleagues observed that teens driving alone found risky decisions rewarding. Blood flow to the ventral striatum, a ""reward center"" in the brain, increased significantly when teen drivers chose to ignore a yellow stoplight and drove through the intersection anyway. Previous research has demonstrated that the ventral striatum is more sensitive to rewards in adolescence than during any other developmental period, Telzer said. ""The prevailing view is that this peak in reward sensitivity in adolescence underlies, in part, adolescent risk-taking,"" she said. A mother's presence, however, blunted the thrill of running the yellow light, Telzer and her colleagues found. ""When mom is there, the heightened ventral striatum activation during risky decisions goes away,"" Telzer said. ""Being risky, it appears, is no longer rewarding in the presence of mom."" Not surprisingly, teens stepped on the brakes significantly more often at yellow lights when their moms were present than when they were alone. ""The teens go from about 55 percent risky choices to about 45 percent when their mom is watching,"" Telzer said. ""That's a big effect."" Another brain region, the prefrontal cortex, kicked into gear when the teens put on the brakes -- but only when their mom was watching, the researchers found. The PFC is important to behavioral regulation, also called ""cognitive control,"" Telzer said. ""When they make safe decisions, when they choose to stop instead of going through that intersection, the prefrontal cortex comes online,"" she said. ""It's activated when mom is there, but not when they're alone."" The PFC (the control center) and the ventral striatum (the reward center) are key brain regions involved in adolescent risk-taking behavior, Telzer said. But in the absence of a well-developed control center, adolescents are more susceptible to the stimulating allure of risky behavior. ""Here we're showing that mom reduces the rewarding nature of risk-taking and increases activation of the prefrontal cortex during safe behavior,"" Telzer said. ""And so these two mechanisms help adolescents to think twice before running the intersection. A parent's presence is actually changing the way the adolescent is reasoning and thinking about risk -- and this increases their safe behavior.""

Beckman Institute researchers investigate how all these mechanisms effortlessly work together--and how they change over time. ""The fact that we can produce all sorts of sounds and we can sing is just amazing to me,"" said Aaron Johnson, affiliate faculty member in the Bioimaging Science and Technology Group at the Beckman Institute and assistant professor in speech and hearing science at Illinois. ""Sounds are produced by the vibrations of just two little pieces of tissue. That's why I've devoted my whole life to studying it: I think it's just incredible."" The sound of the voice is created in the larynx, located in the neck. When we sing or speak, the vocal folds--the two small pieces of tissue--come together and, as air passes over them, they vibrate, which produces sound. After 10 years of working as a professional singer in Chicago choruses, Johnson's passion for vocal performance stemmed into research to understand the voice and its neuromuscular system, with a particular interest in the aging voice. ""The neuromuscular system and larynx change and atrophy as we age, and this contributes to a lot of the deficits that we associate with the older voice, such as a weak, strained, or breathy voice,"" Johnson said. ""I'm interested in understanding how these changes occur, and if interventions, like vocal training, can reverse these effects. In order to do this, I need to look at how the muscles of the larynx move in real time."" Thanks to the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) capabilities in Beckman's Biomedical Imaging Center (BIC), Johnson can view dynamic images of vocal movement at 100 frames per second--a speed that is far more advanced than any other MRI technique in the world. ""Typically, MRI is able to acquire maybe 10 frames per second or so, but we are able to scan 100 frames per second, without sacrificing the quality of the images,"" said Brad Sutton, technical director of the BIC and associate professor in bioengineering at Illinois. The researchers published their technique in the journal Magnetic Resonance in Medicine. The dynamic imaging is especially useful in studying how rapidly the tongue is moving, along with other muscles in the head and neck used during speech and singing. ""In order to capture the articulation movements, 100 frames per second is necessary, and that is what makes this technique incredible,"" Johnson said. With a recent K23 Career Development Award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Johnson is investigating whether group singing training with older adults in residential retirement communities will improve the structure of the larynx, giving the adults stronger, more powerful voices. This research relies on pre- and post-data of laryngeal movement collected with the MRI technique. The basis for the technique was developed by electrical and computer engineering professor Zhi-Pei Liang's group at the Beckman Institute. Sutton and his team further developed and implemented the technique to make high-speed speech imaging possible. ""The technique excels at high spatial and temporal resolution of speech--it's both very detailed and very fast. Often you can have only one these in MR imaging,"" said Sutton. ""We have designed a specialized acquisition method that gathers the necessary data for both space and time in two parts and then combines them to achieve high-quality, high-spatial resolution, and high-speed imaging."" To combine the dynamic imaging with the audio, the researchers use a noise-cancelling fiber-optic microphone to pull out the voice, and then align the audio track with the imaging. ""We have a very dynamic community at the Beckman Institute and Illinois working on this, from engineers to linguists, and we're able to measure things with MRI in ways we couldn't have just a couple of years ago,"" Sutton said.

It suggests that babies experience pain much like adults. The study looked at 10 healthy infants aged between one and six days old and 10 healthy adults aged 23-36 years. Infants were recruited from the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, and adult volunteers were Oxford University staff or students. During the research babies, accompanied by parents and clinical staff, were placed in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner where they usually fell asleep. MRI scans were then taken of the babies' brains as they were 'poked' on the bottom of their feet with a special retracting rod creating a sensation 'like being poked with a pencil'   mild enough that it did not wake them up. These scans were then compared with brain scans of adults exposed to the same stimulus. The researchers found that 18 of the 20 brain regions active in adults experiencing pain were active in babies. Scans also showed that babies  brains had the same response to a weak 'poke' (of force 128mN) as adults did to a stimulus four times as strong (512mN). The findings suggest that not only do babies experience pain much like adults but that they also have a much lower pain threshold. The research was funded by the Wellcome Trust and is reported in the journal eLife. 'Up until recently people didn't think it was possible to study pain in babies using MRI because, unlike adults, they don t keep still in the scanner!' said Dr Rebeccah Slater of Oxford University's Department of Paediatrics, lead author of the report. 'However, as babies that are less than a week old are more docile than older babies, we found that their parents were able to get them to fall asleep inside a scanner so that, for the first time, we could study pain in the infant brain using MRI. 'This is particularly important when it comes to pain: obviously babies can t tell us about their experience of pain and it is difficult to infer pain from visual observations. In fact some people have argued that babies' brains are not developed enough for them to really 'feel' pain, any reaction being just a reflex   our study provides the first really strong evidence that this is not the case.' The researchers say that it is now possible to see pain 'happening' inside the infant brain and it looks a lot like pain in adults. As recently as the 1980s it was common practice for babies to be given neuromuscular blocks but no pain relief medication during surgery1. In 2014 a review of neonatal pain management practice in intensive care highlighted that although such infants experience an average of 11 painful procedures per day 60% of babies do not receive any kind of pain medication2. 'Thousands of babies across the UK undergo painful procedures every day but there are often no local pain management guidelines to help clinicians. Our study suggests that not only do babies experience pain but they may be more sensitive to it than adults,' said Dr Slater. 'We have to think that if we would provide pain relief for an older child undergoing a procedure then we should look at giving pain relief to an infant undergoing a similar procedure.' Dr Slater added: 'Recent studies in adults have shown that it is possible to detect a neurological signature of pain using MRI. In the future we hope to develop similar systems to detect the 'pain signature' in babies' brains: this could enable us to test different pain relief treatments and see what would be most effective for this vulnerable population who can t speak for themselves.' Rachel Edwards, who is 33 and from Oxford, gave permission for her son Alex to take part in the study. Alex was the first baby to be placed in the MRI scanner. She says, 'people know so little about how babies feel pain, you can tell they are in distress from their reaction and I was curious about why they react in the way they do. 'Before Alex went in I got to feel all the things he would feel as part of the study including the pencil-like retracting rod: it wasn't particularly painful, it was more of a precise feeling of touch. 'It was really reassuring how highly skilled the staff were and how good they were at calming and handling him. 'I fed him and put him down on this special bean bag that they suck all the air out of to help keep the babies' heads still. Then they put on earphones that cut out some of the sound but I think the noise actually soothed him. He was out for the count, he didn't wake up during the scanning and seemed really content afterwards.'

But researchers warn that routine surveillance is crucial as poor quality medicines exist, leaving malaria patients at risk of dying and increasing the risk of drug resistance. Previous reports had suggested that up to one third of antimalarials could be fake. Researchers from the Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) Consortium at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine analysed 2,028 antimalarials from Tanzania and Cambodia. Samples were selected in a rigorous and representative way making this one of the most recent comprehensive data sets on antimalarial quality. Drugs were analysed in three independent laboratories in the UK and USA and classed as acceptable quality, falsified (fake drugs which do not contain the stated active pharmaceutical ingredient or API) or substandard (genuine medicines produced by authorised manufacturers which do not have the correct amount of API). No falsified drugs were found in either country. However, substandard drugs were found in 31% of samples in Cambodia and in 12% of samples in Tanzania.  In Tanzania, the study team used an  overt sampling  system, telling vendors that they were going to analyse the quality of their medicines. In Cambodia, researchers used overt sampling as well as a  mystery client  approach, where actors pretended to be patients with malaria, or their relatives, and bought the medicines offered to them. Both studies used a randomised approach to sampling of drug outlets, which differs from previous studies that mostly used non-representative methods for selecting drugs for analysis. Dr Harparkash Kaur from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, lead investigator of the drug quality programme of the ACT Consortium, said:  Although there have been alarming reports about the prevalence of fake antimalarials, our study provides ample data showing that the quality of drugs is not so bad based on comprehensive sampling and analysis presented here. This type of study is very cost intensive, both for the purchase and analysis of drugs. The lack of falsified medicines in Cambodia and Tanzania are reassuring, but the presence of substandard medicines is definitely a concern.  Dr Shunmay Yeung from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, lead author of the study in Cambodia   one of the epicentres of resistance to artemisinin   said:  Falsified medicines have received much attention globally, but substandard drugs are far more prevalent and of great concern. Not only do they leave patients with malaria undertreated, which could be fatal, but they may also contribute to the development of resistance to ACTs, the most effective drugs for malaria. Generally, the fact that no falsified antimalarials were identified reflects the positive impact of the country s effort to control drug quality.  Dr Catherine Goodman from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who led the study in Tanzania, said:  There is an urgent need to strengthen the capacity of national medicine regulation authorities to develop robust estimates of drug quality that are affordable, representative and timely. Our study saved costs by collecting samples within a nationally representative survey that was already in place.  In Tanzania, one fourth of the 1,737 medicines analysed were prequalified by the World Health Organization, and these were less likely to be of poor quality than those not prequalified. The lead investigators highlighted that results based on low cost convenience sampling approaches are still useful in drawing attention to the problem. However, alarming messages could be counter-productive by undermining the confidence in drugs and health care providers and systems. These are the first published results from the ACT Consortium s large drug quality programme, which analysed over 10,000 samples from malaria endemic countries over five years. Results from Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana and Rwanda will be published in the next few months.","Published: April 22, 2015"

Making various types of instruments smaller is another example of how the use of this technology has produced significant advancements. One such instrument is the gas chromatography system used in a number of scientific, medical, and industrial settings to separate and analyze dangerous, volatile organic compounds in gases, liquids, and solids. For the past several years, Masoud Agah, an associate professor in Virginia Tech's Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, has used a National Science Foundation award to develop a credit-card-sized gas chromatography platform that can analyze volatile compounds within seconds.""The advantages that such miniaturized instruments can provide include the portability for analysis in remote locations with high throughput and low cost,"" Agah said. A war zone might be considered a remote location. In conducting his research, Agah identified a problem that allowed him to develop his new technology. He explained that the research community has more actively pursued ""the hybrid integrated approach"" for the development of micro gas chromatography system and this method is relatively ""less vibrant in the monolithic integrated approach."" Agah explained that the hybrid integration approach allows the major components of the system, to be miniaturized individually on separately fabricated chips. These components are then manually assembled using commercially available off-chip fluidic interconnects. ""This hybrid integration method leads to an increase in the fabrication cost since it involves the separate processing of the individual components,"" Agah added. ""The manual assembly of the individual components is really a cumbersome job and increases the overall weight and footprint of the micro gas chromatography system. To some extent; the hybrid integrated approach is inconsistent with the purpose of micro gas chromatography research since further improvement in terms of size, cost, and performance can be achieved by the single chip or monolithic integration of micro gas chromatography components"" he added. His most recent advancement in this area is the subject of an article appearing in a peer-reviewed journal of the Royal Society of Chemistry called Lab on a Chip. Agah and his graduate students Muhammad Akbar of Islamabad, Pakistan and Hamza Shakeel of Rawalpindi, Pakistan developed a unique gas chromatography on-chip module. ""The experimental results are really encouraging and address the deficiencies I described,"" Agah revealed. ""The gas chromatography on-a-chip provides highly efficient separations and detection, reduced analysis times using temperature and flow programming, as well as fast detection response times suitable for high-speed gas chromatography."" The system's reliability was also impressive. Results were found to be highly repeatable with less than 10 percent variations, and no deterioration of the detector excitation electrodes was observed after 12 hours of continuous operation.

The researchers discovered the foreign DNA sequences of Agrobacterium while searching the genome   this is the entire DNA-code   of sweet potato for viral diseases. Instead of contributing this peculiar finding to bacterial contamination of the plant samples, the researchers decided to study these sequences in more detail. The sequences appeared to be present in each of the 291 tested sweet potato cultivars and even in some wild related species. Different research methods confirmed the same conclusion: the specific sequences are not due to contamination, but they are part of the sweet potato genome. The genes in the foreign DNA sequences were also shown to be active in sweet potato, which can indicate that they provide a positive characteristic which was selected for by the farmers during domestication. The natural presence of Agrobacterium demonstrates that genetic modification also happens in nature. In comparison to 'natural' gmos, that are beyond our control, human-made gmos have the advantage that we know exactly which characteristic we add to the plant.

When engineers figured out how to do that two decades ago, they enabled complex tests to be performed with tiny ""lab on a chip"" technology. But until now, there has been no way to accurately measure the size of the tiny vessels they created. Now, scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have found a potential solution to this longstanding manufacturing issue. The NIST approach could meet an important need in the microfluidics industry, which creates devices useful in fields from medical testing to toxin detection. It could be particularly important for miniaturized devices that rely on volume measurements to report, for example, the concentration of a particular molecule in a mixture. Because microfluidic devices are good at straining and purifying liquids, they have found use across the biotech field, where they are invaluable for DNA testing, distilling specific proteins from a mixture, and other applications where a great number of samples need to be analyzed quickly. These labs on a chip can take a variety of shapes depending on their purpose, but they often feature tiny pipes and chambers where fluid samples flow and collect. These channels and reservoirs have presented a longstanding problem to manufacturers, whose devices are often made of plastic. There's been no way to measure their dimensions effectively for quality control. It's hard for a company that makes plastic devices to guarantee that one of their miniature labs will perform the same as another or to design devices whose function depends on knowing how much fluid there is and how much difference there is between the intended design and the final assembly. ""The inability to determine these dimensions limits a multi-billion dollar industry,"" says NIST's Darwin Reyes. ""Without them, your chip might not give you the right value for the concentration of insulin in a blood test, for example, or tell you how much DNA there was at one crucial step in the process."" The NIST team's solution has been to survey a number of potential measurement methods in the hopes that some combination of them would turn out to deliver reliable results. According to Reyes, it was the first time anyone had looked at multiple techniques and compared their efficacy quantitatively for knowing the actual dimensions of the channel. Their survey led them to a pair of techniques: optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal microscopy (CM). They found that while neither could reliably measure all dimensions by itself, OCT could measure a channel's depth to an accuracy of 4 percent while CM gave readings of its width at the bottom to within 5 percent. The results matched those obtained by filling the channels with epoxy and measuring its cross-section later ""an approach that gives great answers but unfortunately ruins the device in the process,"" Reyes says. The combination of OCT and CM only takes a few minutes and would therefore be fast enough to meet manufacturers' needs, Reyes says, though at this point it would be expensive. But, he says, the work ""opens the door for what could be seen as a standard method for measuring microfluidic devices in very little time and with traceable accuracy and precision.""","Published: April 22, 2015"

While standard, culture-based surveys are able to detect only a handful of different species, the high-tech molecular technique revealed that an average dust sample from the study contained roughly 4,700 different bacterial species and about 1,400 fungal species. The total number of bacterial species identified in the study was more than 110,000, along with more than 55,000 fungal species, many unknown to science. But not all bacteria and fungi are harmful   many have health benefits, researchers now know.  We inhale thousands of airborne microbes every hour we spend outdoors, some of which can cause illnesses or trigger allergic disorders,  said lead study author and CU-Boulder Associate Professor Noah Fierer of the ecology and evolutionary biology department.  This study provides the first glimpse of the continental-scale distributions of microorganisms in the atmosphere, giving us the baseline data to ask all sorts of interesting questions.  It might now be possible to correlate specific areas in cities or states where people are especially sensitive to fungal allergies or asthma, for example, with areas that have particular fungal types regularly swirling in the outdoor air, said Fierer. A paper on the subject was published in the April 20 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Co-authors include CU-Boulder s Albert Barberan and Jonathan Leff, NCSU s Rob Dunn and Holly Menninger and the University of California, San Francisco s Katherine Pollard and Joshua Ladau. Several patterns emerged during the study, said Fierer, also a fellow at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES). The team found a  bicoastal  pattern showing that microbial communities from homes on the East Coast and West Coast were more similar to each other than those from homes in the nation s interior. Airborne microbes are capable of being transported phenomenal distances   aerosols in Saharan dust clouds from Africa, for instance, have been shown to impact the ecology of lakes in Spain and coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea. While the microbial communities in the study were highly variable in composition across America, their geographic patterns are associated in large part with variability in climate and soils, Fierer said. Volunteers collected the samples as part of Wild Life in Our Homes project, a national citizen-scientist effort coordinated by NCSU. Participants from all 50 states used kits mailed to them to swab the dust from the upper door trim on the outside surface of an exterior door for bacteria and fungal samples. Door trim is an ideal site: It s found on virtually every home and collects outdoor aerosols with little or no direct contact by home occupants. While there is the perception that those living in the country breathe in far different types of bacteria and fungi than those living in cities, that does not seem to be the case, said the study authors. Even though urban and rural samples of dust were not distinct from each other, the study does suggest urbanization leads to at least some degree of homogenization of airborne microbe types.  If I go from a rural area near Raleigh, North Carolina, to downtown Raleigh, I don t see a big difference in airborne microbial life between the two places,  said Dunn, a biological sciences associate professor at NCSU.  But if I go from Raleigh to New York City, the microbial life is even more similar. So there are subtle differences here.  The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation s Microbiology of the Built Environment program and the National Science Foundation funded the study. Fierer likened the new United States microbial map to botanical maps of the country assembled by U.S. scientists more than 150 years ago.  Going into this study, we didn t even know answers to basic questions like whether the airborne bacteria and fungi in Denver were different from those in San Francisco,  said CU-Boulder co-author Albert Barberan, a CIRES postdoctoral researcher.  But we saw certain patterns, and now we have the methods and tools to answer new questions.  The PNAS paper is a companion study to one published last week in the journal PLOS ONE by the NCSU and CU-Boulder researchers showing fungal DNA can be used to track the origin of dust samples, making it a potential forensic tool for use by law enforcement officials or archaeologists. Given a swab of dust from anywhere in the country, the team can identify its geographic origin, sometimes within 60 miles or less. In 2010, Fierer led another CU-Boulder study that showed unique bacterial signatures from a person s hand left behind on objects like computer keyboards and computer mice might also be effective as a forensics tool to confirm DNA and fingerprint analyses.  Working with the public in our research is one of our lab s guiding principles,  said Dunn.  One of the biggest challenges moving forward to manage our planet sensibly is to engage the public to help us study and understand the life around us.  While there historically has been a glass wall through which citizens watched scientists at work, we want to take down the glass and have scientists and citizens communicate back and forth, altering the way each group thinks about the world,  Dunn said. The research involved isolating and amplifying tiny bits of microbial DNA, then sequencing that DNA to identify the different bacteria and fungal species found in each dust sample.

Since Bio Rad Laboratories introduced its QX100TM Droplet Digital PCR system in 2012, researchers have been using the technology in oncology research with an objective of tailoring cancer treatments   on a tumor-by-tumor basis   by reading the genetic mutations, amplifications, and rearrangements that make each tumor unique.  Researchers are leveraging the unique ability of the ddPCR technology to detect a very small amount of variant DNA   specifically, oncogenic mutant DNA   quickly, inexpensively, and reliably. From developing a ddPCR-based test that could help physicians guide personalized therapy to tracking tumor mutations that cause drug resistance, researchers from more than a dozen academic institutions and biotech companies highlight the latest advancements using ddPCR technology in cancer research. To date, more than 200 peer-reviewed studies have employed ddPCR systems, of which more than 20 involve their use in research using a cancer liquid biopsy. Several of the studies highlighted as posters at AACR include: Droplet Digital PCR Provides a More Sensitive Test to Detect Gene Amplifications in Tumors Than Next-Generation Sequencing Clinical Methods Gene amplifications of oncogenes are hallmarks of certain cancer types that are directly linked to FDA-approved treatments, but tests that can adequately detect these copy number alterations have been limited by DNA quantity and tumor purity and heterogeneity. Furthermore, biopsies stored as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples are notoriously difficult to work with and yield limited amounts of DNA as the samples can become easily degraded. In a joint research venture, TOMA Biosciences in Foster City, CA, and the Intermountain Precision Genomics in Saint George, UT, found that a new ddPCR-based test using FFPE samples called the Amplinome Test is over 10 times more sensitive than next-generation sequencing (NGS) clinical methods in detecting gene amplifications of 12 genes commonly amplified in cancer. The Amplinome Test detected gene amplifications that that the NGS method missed. This poster (#23) will be presented from 1-5 PM on Sunday, April 19, in Section 26.  Tracking Patient Response to Cancer Treatments is Quick and Simple Using ddPCR Technology Unfortunately, patients can develop additional mutations within the tumor as a result of cancer treatment, leading to drug resistance. Researchers from The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and The Institute of Cancer Research, London will present findings that use patient blood plasma with ddPCR methods to track the evolution of tumor resistance to treatment with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies.  This poster (#12) will be presented from 8-12 PM on Tuesday, April 21, in Section 31. Multiplexing Detects Multiple Mutations Simultaneously, Maximizing Information Gained from Limited Patient Samples For high sensitivity measurements of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), scientists are given samples of plasma with extremely small amounts of tumor-derived DNA that they use to determine a patient s cancer mutations. Multiplexing allows the detection of multiple mutations in a single reaction. The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX will present research that shows multiplex testing for KRAS mutations does not sacrifice accuracy, even with volumes of DNA as low as 16 ng. Multiplexing saves time, money and is feasible in samples with small proportions of cancer-derived mutant DNA.  This poster (#10) will be presented from 1-5 PM on Monday, April 20, in Section 21. Droplet Digital PCR Technology Permits Absolute Counting of Target Molecules Dawne Shelton, PhD, Bio-Rad, will give a talk that summarizes work covering the use of ddPCR technology in the tracking of cell-free tumor DNA for early detection of tumor DNA in blood as well as the monitoring of patient treatment and disease progression. Dr. Shelton will also highlight how ddPCR technology has been used to detect copy number amplifications of genes commonly associated with cancer, such as MYC, HER2, and EGFR, and for the detection of KRAS mutations using a multiplex screening strategy.  Dawne s presentation will be held from 2-3 PM on Sunday, April 19, in the Exhibitor Spotlight Theater A.   Bio-Rad will have a Booth (1527) featuring the award-winning QX200  Droplet Digital PCR System (the QX200 system is the latest in the series). The company will also present its newly introduced PrimePCR  ddPCR KRAS Screening Multiplex Kit on display at its booth. The KRAS Multiplex Kit can simultaneously detect the seven most common KRAS mutations that play a critical role in tumorigenesis and are most commonly found in pancreatic, thyroid, colorectal, and lung cancers. Bio-Rad will also highlight the Automated Droplet Generator (AutoDG ) that provides an automated workflow and simplifies the ddPCR workflow.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/imaging-immunity-197819,Imaging Immunity Noninvasive imaging of immune system detects tumors  could monitor therapeutic response  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A novel approach that allows real-time imaging of the immune system s response to the presence of tumors without the need for blood draws or invasive biopsies offers a potential breakthrough both in diagnostics and in the ability to monitor efficacy of cancer therapies. The method, developed in the lab of Whitehead Institute Member Hidde Ploegh and reported online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), harnesses the imaging power of positron emission tomography (PET), which is normally used to monitor cancer metabolism, to identify areas of immune cell activity associated with inflammation or tumor development.  Every experimental immunologist wants to monitor an ongoing immune response, but what are the options?  Ploegh asks rhetorically.  One can look at blood, but blood is a vehicle of transport for immune cells and is not where immune responses occur. Surgical biopsies are invasive and non-random, so, for example, a fine-needle aspirate of a tumor could miss a significant feature of that condition.  In search of a better monitoring approach Ploegh leveraged two research tools that have become staples in his lab in recent years. The first exploits so-called single-domain antibodies known as VHHs, derived from the heavy chain-only antibodies made by the immune systems of animals in the camelid family. Ploegh s lab immunizes alpacas his camelid of choice to generate VHHs specific to immune cells of interest. The second tool, known as sortagging, labels the VHHs in site-specific fashion to enable the tracking of the VHHs and their targets in a living animal. Knowing that the tissue around tumors often contains immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages, Ploegh and his lab members hypothesized that appropriately labeled VHHs might allow them to pinpoint tumor locations by finding the tumor-associated immune cells. Ploegh notes that VHHs  extremely small size approximately one-tenth that of conventional antibodies are likely responsible for their superior tissue penetration and thus makes them particularly well suited for such use. For the current research, the lab generated VHHs that recognize mouse immune cells, then labeled these VHHs with radioisotopes, and injected them into tumor-bearing mice. Subsequent PET imaging detected the location of immune cells around the tumor quickly and accurately.  We were able to image tumors as small as one millimeter in size and within just a few days of their starting to grow,  says Mohammad Rashidian, a postdoctoral researcher in Ploegh s lab and first author of the PNAS paper.  We re very excited about this because it s a powerful approach to pick up inflammation in and around the tumor.  Rashidian and Ploegh believe that with further refinement, the method could be used to monitor response to and perhaps modify cancer immunotherapy, which, though quite promising, has thus far met with great success in some cases, but has failed in others.  To succeed with immunotherapy, we need more information about the tumor microenvironment,  says Rashidian.  With this method, you could perhaps start immunotherapy, and then, a few weeks later, image with VHHs to figure out progress and success of treatment.  Adds Ploegh:  PET imaging should allow a much more comprehensive look at the entire tumor in its environment. Then we can ask,  Did the tumor grow? Did immune cells invade? What has happened to the tumor?  And to be able to see this without going in invasively is a significant achievement.

The planned move will double the size of XenoTech s global headquarters, currently located at 16825 W. 116th St. in Lenexa, KS.  The new facility, boasting nearly two and a half times the customized laboratory space, will remain in the Kansas City metro area, just blocks away from where the company was founded more than twenty years ago.  Remaining in the Kansas City area maintains the company s central location, ideal for quick access to both the East and West coasts of the United States.  XenoTech is expected to complete the move into the new global headquarters in late fall, 2015.  XenoTech s new location will serve as the global headquarters for their contract research business, providing the space necessary for an expanding range of services covering discovery through clinical support.  XenoTech s world-renowned in vitro products will continue to be produced within the new headquarters and will be used to support the contract research business conducted on-site.  XenoTech provides a variety of in vitro products and reagents to companies worldwide. We are known for our world-class services, but our in-house manufacturing of products not only helps to facilitate our global customers  internal research efforts, but also provides the solid foundation behind our in vitro ADME / DDI service expertise.  Our products are distributed in over 25 countries worldwide and we have a product catalog more than 90 pages long,  said Christian Darabant, VP of Commercial Operations. XenoTech experienced impressive growth during fiscal year 2014, seeing record bookings and a greater than 15% increase in revenue over 2013.  This growth was not only fuelled by an increasing demand for the company s core ADME / DMPK / DDI expertise but also an ongoing expansion of related products and services designed to maximize convenience, study consistency and efficiency for XenoTech s customers.  This has resulted in an increase in the company s client base and demand for the company s products and services, requiring additional employees and an expanded facility.  XenoTech COO, Jason Neat, explained,  Relocating our headquarters both facilitates and compliments XenoTech s dedication to expanding into natural extensions of our core ADME business.  We take our reputation within the in vitro ADME-DMPK market very seriously, and we will not lose sight of our core expertise.  Instead, this move allows us to grow naturally into complementing areas around our DMPK expertise, expanding our offerings to match the needs of our customers to reduce the time, expense and headache involved in bringing a drug to market.   XenoTech s vision is to be the world s foremost facilitator in the pursuit of life-enhancing therapies, and we are one step closer to that goal with the expansion into our new building.  We will use the new space to drive scientific innovation and expand our offerings to ensure clients the quality they have come to expect from XenoTech, in a wider array of services, at even more attractive timelines,  added Neat. The relocation also provides benefits to the Kansas City, KS community.  XenoTech hired 11 full-time staff members over the course of 2014 and is planning continued expansion of its workforce throughout the next few years.  XenoTech employees bring a community-focused outlook to the region and have raised nearly $250,000 in charitable donations and given countless hours of personal time towards community outreach and philanthropic events.","Published: April 22, 2015"

Research from Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey involving the development of human organoid prostate models could have implications for how future therapy is guided for some of this population, say investigators. At focus is the development of prostate stem cell-derived organoids, the size of a pinhead, that were developed from prostate cancer biopsy and resected tissue taken from patients with early-stage and advanced prostate cancer. The findings are being presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) being held in Philadelphia this week. Next generation androgen deprivation therapy, radiation and chemotherapy have been clinically effective against advanced prostate cancer. But despite short-term responses, disease recurrence typically occurs. A majority of these recurring tumors are found to have drug resistance that can be identified during initial therapy if primary tumor cells from individual patients can be maintained and their features examined. Cancer Institute of New Jersey investigators wanted to develop a more suitable model in which to better understand how each patient s cancer cells respond to therapy and identify early markers of drug resistance.     Utilizing patient-derived cells from primary prostatectomy tissue, researchers used a two-stage protocol that incorporated developmental epithelial and mesenchymal signals, stem-like cells and other growth requirements in three-dimensional (3D) cultures to foster development of prostate organoids. The team successfully developed 17 prostate organoids out of 19 primary prostatectomy tissues.  Tissue elements also were used to maintain normal regeneration and demonstrate self-renewal properties of non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate in these 3D cultures. Preliminary data show the organoid models developed in the laboratory have the same tissue and cell make-up of human prostates and possess such functioning apsects as androgen receptor signaling and secretion of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) protein.  It was also revealed that when prostate organoids were exposed to the same androgen deprivation therapy that patients have, cells from the prostate organoids maintained genetic and growth rate features of the primary prostate from where tissue was originally secured and markers of therapy resistance could be detected.  When it comes to better understanding therapy resistance in prostate cancer, animal models and human prostate cancer cell lines by themselves are limiting. By using the patient s own tissue in 3D cultures, we are able to develop a new laboratory platform for drug testing that maintains the genetic features of the primary prostate, thus enabling scientists to better identify biomarkers of drug resistance or hormonal resistance,  notes senior author of the work, Hatem Sabaawy, MD, PhD, resident member at the Cancer Institute and assistant professor of medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.  We are encouraged that the prostate organoid model can be used with precision medicine and co-clinical approaches to help guide future clinical trials.

Marya Lieberman of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame and Abigail Weaver, a postdoctoral associate in the University s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, took up the challenge of how people in developing countries could detect low-quality antimalarial drugs without expensive equipment and without handling dangerous chemicals.The solution they developed involves using paper cards, embedded with reagents, that carry out 12 colorful chemical tests all at once on a solid sample. The colors show whether a medicine contains the expected ingredients and whether fillers or substitute drugs have been added. Weaver s and Lieberman s research demonstrated that a library of chemical color tests embedded on a paper card can presumptively identify formulations corresponding to very low-quality antimalarial drugs. The presence or absence of chloroquine, doxycycline, quinine, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine and primaquine antimalarial medications, in addition to filers used in low-quality pharmaceuticals, are indicated by patterns of colors that are generated on the test cards. Test card sensitivity for detection of these pure components ranges from 90 percent to 100 percent with no false positives in the absence of a pharmaceutical. These easy-to-use cards will help people in the developing world identify suspicious medications before they harm patients. Tests are simple and inexpensive enough to be carried out in clinics, pharmacies and ports of entry and could provide a screening method to detect suspicious medicines throughout the supply chain. In previous research, the Lieberman group developed paper tests for antibiotics such as amoxicillin.  The antimalarial drugs are different chemically so we couldn t use that card for this project,  Lieberman said.  Gail developed a new card and tested samples with formulations corresponding to high-quality products or low-quality products, and we measured whether the test card could identify the bad formulations correctly and whether good formulations were misidentified as bad ones.  Now that they have developed the test cards, Lieberman and Weaver are working to get them out of the lab and into the world.  Our immediate next step is to test antimalarial drugs collected by collaborators in southeast Asia to see whether the test cards can detect good and bad pills in that sample pool,  Lieberman said.  Next is to use the cards in an ongoing screening program in Kenya. It s going to require a big push on manufacturing so we can produce larger numbers of cards at even lower cost, as well as development of sophisticated software to enable a computer to read the test results using just a cell phone photograph of a test card. And we can t lose track of the need to remove low-quality products from the market; this requires additional chemical analysis of suspect products and close coordination with the national medical regulatory agency.  Working with the Purdue College of Pharmacy and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) in Kenya, we are setting up a laboratory at MTRH that can conduct confirmatory testing of suspicious pharmaceuticals. This site will act as a sentinel to detect low-quality medicines in western Kenya. Companies like Merck, Lilly and Waters made generous donations of analytical instruments and funding to make this project possible. Our goal is to greatly reduce the time it takes to identify low-quality products in the supply chain so the medical regulatory authorities can take action to protect the health of patients in Kenya and neighboring countries.  The paper appears in a Supplement to the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene titled,  The Pandemic of Falsified Medicines: Laboratory and Field Innovations and Policy Perspectives.  The special issue includes 17 papers on detection technologies and methods, data from field surveillance and policy recommendations describing how public health authorities and decision makers can monitor the scope of the problem, identify problems at all stages of the pharmaceutical supply chain and improve the quality of medications.","Published: April 22, 2015"

The study was conducted by researchers from the Human Neuropsychopharmacology group at the Biomedical Research Institute of Hospital de Sant Pau and from Universitat Aut noma de Barcelona, in collaboration with the Brain Cognition and Plasticity group of the Bellvitge Institute for Biomedical Research (IDIBELL -- University of Barcelona). One of the known consequences of consuming this drug is the memory problems it can cause. Chronic consumers show more difficulties than the general population in retaining new information and recovering memories. The new study also reveals that the chronic use of cannabis causes distortions in memory, making it easier for imaginary or false memories to appear. On occasions, the brain can remember things that never happened. Our memory consists of a malleable process which is created progressively and therefore is subject to distortions or even false memories. These memory ""mistakes"" are seen more frequently in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, but can also be observed in the healthy population, and become more common as we age. One of the most common false memories we have are of situations from our childhood which we believe to remember because the people around us have explained them to us over and over again. Maintaining an adequate control over the ""veracity"" of our memories is a complex cognitive task which allows us to have our own sense of reality and also shapes our behaviour, based on past experiences. In the study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, researchers from Sant Pau and Bellvitge compared a group of chronic consumers of cannabis to a healthy control group while they worked on learning a series of words. After a few minutes they were once again shown the original words, together with new words which were either semantically related or unrelated. All participants were asked to identify the words belonging to the original list. Cannabis consumers believed to have already seen the semantically related new words to a higher degree than participants in the control group. By using magnetic resonance imaging, researchers discovered that cannabis consumers showed a lower activation in areas of the brain related to memory procedures and to the general control of cognitive resources. The study found memory deficiencies despite the fact that participants had stopped consuming cannabis one month before participating in the study. Although they had not consumed the drug in a month, the more the patient had used cannabis throughout their life, the lower the level of activity in the hippocampus, key to storing memories. The results show that cannabis consumers are more vulnerable to suffering memory distortions, even weeks after not consuming the drug. This suggests that cannabis has a prolonged effect on the brain mechanisms which allow us to differentiate between real and imaginary events. These memory mistakes can cause problems in legal cases, for example, due to the effects the testimonies of witnesses and their victims can have. Nevertheless, from a clinical viewpoint, the results point to the fact that a chronic use of cannabis could worsen problems with age-related memory loss.

The international, multi-site study found almost 40 percent of patients had some disease activity return when they stopped taking their meds. The findings were presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting held April 18-25, in Washington, D.C. ""Despite long periods of disease stability while taking medication, we found a large minority of patients who stopped experienced relapses or disability progression,"" says lead study author Ilya Kister, MD, an assistant professor of neurology at the NYU Langone Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center. ""We need to identify situations when it is safe for patients with MS to stop taking these medications."" Little is known about MS disease progression after first-line, disease-modifying therapies are discontinued in clinically-stable patients. For the study, Dr. Kister and colleagues prospectively studied 181 patients from the global observational MSBase Registry, examining MS relapse rates and disability progression rates in patients who stopped taking disease-modifying therapy. Patients in the study were ages 40 and older, had experienced no relapses and reported stable disability progression (measured by EDSS scores) for at least 5 years, and had been taking medication for at least three years. Once medications were ceased, patients were followed for at least three years. After discontinuing medication, 24 percent of patients experienced a clinician-reported relapse, 32 percent sustained three-month disability progression, and 10.6 percent of patients recorded both relapses and disability progression. Researchers found 77 patients -- or 42 percent -- restarted medication after a median of 22 months. Restarting medication was associated with a 59-percent risk reduction of disability progression. More than 2.3 million people worldwide are affected by MS, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS). The unpredictable disease affects the central nervous system, causing disability that can range in severity, with symptoms including muscle weakness, pain, difficulty with coordination and balance, partial or complete paralysis, tremors and hearing and vision loss. Medication can help to manage attacks, reduce symptoms, and slow the progression of multiple sclerosis. According to the NMSS, some people stop taking disease-modifying medication for reasons including side effects, perceptions they're not feeling better or because they still experience exacerbations, or insurance purposes. ""Decisions regarding stopping disease-modifying therapy may have implications for short and long-term prognosis. We know a lot about what happens when therapy is started, but we know very little about what happens when therapy is stopped,"" says Dr Kister.

""We identified a novel circuit in the brain that becomes active during nicotine withdrawal, specifically increasing anxiety,"" said principal investigator Andrew Tapper, PhD , associate professor of psychiatry. ""Increased anxiety is a prominent nicotine withdrawal symptom that contributes to relapse in smokers attempting to quit."" The study yielded several discoveries about interconnected brain mechanisms that induce anxiety during nicotine withdrawal--and possible ways to derail these mechanisms in order to treat, or even prevent the especially troublesome symptom. Experiments leading to the multiple, related findings were conducted over several years by the laboratories of Dr. Tapperand Paul Gardner, PhD, professor of psychiatry at UMMS; and collaborator Olivier George, PhD, assistant professor in the Committee on Neurobiology of Addictive Disorder at The Scripps Research Institute of La Jolla, Cal. Lead author was Rubing Zhao-Shea, MD, research assistant professor of psychiatry at UMMS. Published in Nature Communications, the study's main finding is that a brain region called the interpeduncular nucleus is activated and appears to cause anxiety during nicotine withdrawal. Investigators were intrigued to learn that the sub region of the interpeduncular nucleus, which is activated and linked to anxiety during withdrawal, is distinct from another sub-region, previously identified by Tapper, where physical nicotine withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, nausea and insomnia originate. Anxiety is an affective symptom often likely to thwart smokers' attempts to quit. The newly discovered sub region offers a distinct target for dampening the affective symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Also newly identified is the fact that input from neurons in two other brain regions converge onto the interpeduncular nucleus to stimulate anxiety-provoking neurons. Surprisingly, the ventral tegmental area, which is traditionally associated with the rewarding or pleasurable effects of abused drugs, activates neuron receptors through corticotropin releasing factor, a protein neurotransmitter released in response to stress. Also surprising, neurons in the medial habenula stimulate interpeduncular nucleus neurons by releasing glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, an effect that is increased by corticotropin releasing factor receptor activation. ""Both of these inputs are important. We could alleviate anxiety during nicotine withdrawal by either preventing corticotropin releasing factor synthesis in the ventral tegmental area, or by silencing the medial habenula inputs into the interpeduncular nucleus,"" said Tapper. Investigators were able to alleviate anxiety in mice by quieting the activity of those activated neurons, suggesting the same might be possible for humans. ""There are already drugs that block the CRF receptor that contributes to activation of these anxiety-inducing neurons,"" Tapper noted. ""These receptors have previously been linked to anxiety and depression, so our findings may also have implications for anxiety disorders in general."" Next steps for this productive research collaboration will be expanding the scope of scientists' understanding of the interactions between anxiety, stress, reward, and withdrawal from addictive substances. ""We're now exploring whether the circuitry that we identified is involved in stress-induced anxiety in general, or specific to nicotine withdrawal-induced anxiety,"" Tapper said. ""We're also exploring if this circuitry is engaged with other drugs of abuse."" University of Massachusetts Medical School   Original reporting by: Sandra Gray Rubing Zhao-Shea, Steven R.

Although a substantial body of research over the last 15 years has found no link between the MMR vaccine and ASD, parents and others continue to associate the vaccine with ASD. Surveys of parents who have children with ASD suggest that many believe the MMR vaccine was a contributing cause. This belief, combined with knowing that younger siblings of children with ASD are already at higher genetic risk for ASD compared with the general population, might prompt these parents to avoid vaccinating their younger children, according to background information in the article. Anjali Jain, M.D., of the Lewin Group, Falls Church, Va., and colleagues examined ASD occurrence by MMR vaccine status in a large sample of U.S. children who have older siblings with and without ASD. The researchers used an administrative claims database associated with a large commercial health plan. Participants included children continuously enrolled in the health plan from birth to at least 5 years of age during 2001-2012 who also had an older sibling continuously enrolled for at least 6 months between 1997 and 2012. Of the 95,727 children included in the study, 1,929 (2.01 percent) had an older sibling with ASD. Overall, 994 (1.04 percent) children in the cohort had ASD diagnosed during follow-up. Among those who had an older sibling with ASD, 134 (6.9 percent) were diagnosed with ASD, compared with 860 (0.9 percent) diagnosed with ASD among those with siblings without ASD. The MMR vaccination rate (l dose or more) for the children with unaffected siblings (siblings without ASD) was 84 percent (n = 78,564) at 2 years and 92 percent (n = 86,063) at age 5 years. In contrast, the MMR vaccination rates for children with older siblings with ASD were lower (73 percent at age 2 years and 86 percent at age 5 years). Analysis of the data indicated that MMR vaccine receipt was not associated with an increased risk of ASD at any age. ""Consistent with studies in other populations, we observed no association between MMR vaccination and increased ASD risk among privately insured children. We also found no evidence that receipt of either 1 or 2 doses of MMR vaccination was associated with an increased risk of ASD among children who had older siblings with ASD. As the prevalence of diagnosed ASD increases, so does the number of children who have siblings diagnosed with ASD, a group of children who are particularly important as they were under-vaccinated in our observations as well as in previous reports,"" the authors write. Editorial: Promising Forecast for Autism Spectrum Disorders In an accompanying editorial, Bryan H. King, M.D., M.B.A., of the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, comments on the findings of this study. ""Some parents of children with ASD may have chosen to delay immunization in subsequent children until they were certain any risk had passed. Such behavior, which arguably could enrich the immunization rate in the nonautism subgroup relative to the group that may have been showing early atypical development, might create the impression that MMR vaccine is actually reducing risk for ASD. Indeed, Jain et al report relative risks of less than 1.0. Even so, short of arguing that MMR vaccine actually reduces the risk of ASD in those who were immunized by age 2 years, the only conclusion that can be drawn from the study is that there is no signal to suggest a relationship between MMR and the development of autism in children with or without a sibling who has autism."" ""Taken together, some dozen studies have now shown that the age of onset of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, the severity or course of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, and now the risk of ASD recurrence in families does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children.""

The guideline is published in the April 21, 2015, print issue of Neurology , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and was presented at the AAN Annual Meeting in Washington, DC, April 18-25, 2015, which is the world s largest gathering of neurologists. One in 10 people worldwide have a first seizure in their lifetime. According to The International League Against Epilepsy, epilepsy is defined as one or more seizures with a high likelihood of recurrence, not due to another immediately triggering cause, such as low blood sugar. The guideline, which reviewed all available evidence, found that taking epilepsy drugs immediately after a first seizure may reduce the risk of having another seizure. The decision to treat after a first seizure is complex because doctors must consider the risks and benefits for each individual patient.  This is a valuable new guideline that could change the approach many doctors take to treating a first seizure and could improve patients  lives,  said guideline author Allan Krumholz, MD, with University of Maryland School of Medicine and Fellow of the American Academy of Neurology.  About 150,000 adults have an unprovoked first seizure in the United States each year. Even one seizure is traumatic and affects a person s life in many social ways, such as driving a car, employment options, falling risks and the fear of having another seizure in public. This guideline clarifies when risk factors put individuals at greater risk.  Seizures that are  unprovoked  happen for no immediately known reason. According to the Institute of Medicine, one in 26 Americans will develop epilepsy in their lifetime. The guideline shows there is strong evidence that for adults who have had a first seizure, the risk of another seizure is greatest within the first two years. The risk ranges from about a one-in-five chance, or 21 percent, to nearly a one-in-two chance, or 45 percent. The guideline also found strong evidence that the risk of a second seizure is greatest in people with a previous brain problem, such as head injury, stroke, or brain tumor and in those with an EEG test result that shows signs of epilepsy. The analysis shows moderate evidence that the risk is greatest in people with a significant abnormality on imaging tests of the brain and in those who had a seizure during sleep. The guideline found moderate evidence that immediate treatment with an epilepsy drug can lower this risk. However, moderate evidence also shows that over the longer term of more than three years, immediate treatment with an epilepsy drug, rather than waiting for another seizure before treating, is unlikely to increase or decrease the likelihood of long-term improvement or seizure freedom. The guideline notes that aside from affecting lifestyle choices, epilepsy drugs carry risks of side effects ranging from seven to 31 percent.  This guideline does not give a simple, black-and-white recommendation whether an adult should immediately be started on an epilepsy drug,  said Jacqueline French, MD, with the New York University Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center and Fellow with the American Academy of Neurology.  What is most important is that the decision whether to immediately treat a first seizure requires meaningful conversation between patient and doctor so that the patient s individual circumstances, balance of risks and benefits, and personal preferences are understood and accounted for.    The guideline was endorsed by the American Neurological Association and the World Federation of Neurology. The guideline was supported by the American Academy of Neurology.

It's rarely considered in patients who survive a critical illness and stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, in a recent Johns Hopkins study, researchers found that nearly one-quarter of ICU survivors suffer from PTSD. They also identified possible triggers for PTSD and indicated a potential preventive strategy: having patients keep ICU diaries. ""PTSD can drastically impact a person's ability to communicate and connect with others, truly interrupting their lives and preventing experiences of joy,"" says Joe Bienvenu, M.D., associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""This is why our findings are important and why it's so critical that we continue to research ways to prevent PTSD."" Similar research was done in years past, but there was much less data at that time. ""We now have a larger data set to review and learn from,"" says Ann Parker, a fellow in the Johns Hopkins Medicine Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine. ""These data could help us develop better prevention methods for ICU-induced PTSD."" Through a systematic literature review, the research team looked at 40 studies of 36 unique patient cohorts with a total of more than 3,000 patients who survived a critical illness and ICU stay. The researchers excluded patients who had suffered a trauma, such as a car crash, or brain injury, because those patients' cognitive and psychological outcomes can be affected by the injury itself, rather than the critical illness/ICU stay. They found that the prevalence of PTSD in the studies ranged from 10 to 60 percent. To pinpoint a more definitive estimate of PTSD prevalence, the researchers conducted a meta-analysis of a subset of the 40 studies. They selected six studies, with a total of about 450 patients, that used a PTSD measurement tool called the Impact of Event Scale between one and six months after ICU discharge. From these data, they found that one in four patients had symptoms of PTSD. The researchers repeated the same meta-analysis for studies that looked at patients seven to 12 months after an ICU stay and found that one in five patients had PTSD. ""These rates are as high as you might see in combat soldiers or rape victims,"" says Dale Needham, M.D., a professor of medicine and of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Johns Hopkins. ""Our clinicians and patients should know that the high risk of PTSD exists among patients surviving critical illness."" Common risk factors for PTSD included being diagnosed with a psychological problem, such as anxiety or depression, before coming to the ICU, the researchers found. Another risk factor was receiving large amounts of sedation medication while in the ICU. Additionally, patients that reported having frightening memories of being in the ICU have a higher risk of PTSD. These symptoms occur across a wide variety of patients, regardless of their age, diagnosis, severity of illness or length of stay. ""This tells us that if we focus on factors traditionally associated with worse physical outcomes, such as a patient's age, we may miss individuals with psychiatric symptoms,"" says Bienvenu. The researchers also looked at the best ways to prevent PTSD. The solution that seemed most effective was an ICU diary, a notebook that allows clinicians and family members to write daily messages about what is happening to the patient. ""Diaries seem to help patients process their experience and formulate more accurate memories of their time in the ICU. They provide patients with a tool to better understand their experience in the ICU through the words of their loved ones and caregivers,"" says Bienvenu. At the Johns Hopkins Hospital, the medical ICU team will be rolling out a quality improvement project that will include using an ICU diary as a tool to prevent PTSD and improve recovery. Relatively few institutions in the U.S. use ICU diaries, but they're commonly employed in Europe. Johns Hopkins plans to use them for patients entering the medical ICU and will further evaluate their effectiveness as a therapeutic tool. With more than 5 million people annually requiring ICU-level care in the United States and more than 750,000 Americans needing mechanical ventilators, ""it's clear that those who care for ICU patients need to be aware that there could be long-term consequences of critical illness and lifesaving treatments, including PTSD, which can significantly limit a patient's quality of life well after discharge,"" says Parker. The field of critical care medicine is getting better at saving lives, but there's now an ever-growing group of ICU survivors. ""To ensure that these patients have the best possible quality of life, we have to look at what their lives are like after they leave the ICU,"" says Needham. For years Needham and his colleagues have studied what happens to patients after they leave the ICU. ""Our previous research looked at patients one to five years after surviving a critical illness in the ICU,"" he says. ""We analyzed the physical, cognitive and psychological effects of their critical illness/ICU care and uncovered an array of challenges that are clinically referred to as post-intensive care syndrome."" PTSD is just one aspect of post-intensive care syndrome, he says. From Needham's initial research, his team, led by Parker, was driven to look deeper into the prevalence, risk factors and prevention strategies for PTSD in critical illness survivors, which led them to their current Critical Care Medicine study.

The new detection method, based on breath analysis, has significant advantages over the existing detection technology: Gut reports that the new method is quick, simple, inexpensive and non-invasive. Gastric cancer is one of the most lethal forms of cancer and in most cases, its diagnosis involves an endoscopy (the insertion of a tube into the esophagus, requiring that the patient fast and receive an intravenous sedative). Treatment is aggressive chemotherapy, radiation and the full or partial removal of the stomach. The disease develops in a series of well-defined steps, but there s currently no effective, reliable, and non-invasive screening test for picking up these changes early on. Thus, many people succumb to stomach cancer only because it was not diagnosed in time. The new technology, developed by Prof. Hossam Haick of the Technion Faculty of Chemical Engineering, can be used to detect premalignant lesions at the earliest stage, when healthy cells start becoming cancerous. The research, published in Gut as part of the doctoral thesis of Mr. Haitham Amal, was conducted in conjunction with a Latvian research group headed by Prof. Marcis Leja, based on the largest population sample ever in a trial of this type. 484 people participated in the trial, 99 of whom had already been diagnosed with stomach cancer. All the participants were tested for Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium known to increase the risk for stomach cancer, and two breath samples were taken from each person. The first sample from each participant was analyzed using the GCMS technique, which measures volatile organic substances in exhaled breath. The researchers noted that GCMS technology cannot be used to detect stomach cancer because the testing is very expensive and requires lengthy processing times and considerable expertise to operate the equipment. The second breath sample was tested using nanoarray analysis, the unique technology developed by Prof. Haick, combined with a pattern recognition algorithm.

The library, being developed by David Goodlett, PhD, the Isaac E. Emerson Chair of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the School of Pharmacy and Robert Ernst, PhD, an associate professor in the Department of Microbial Pathogenesis at the School of Dentistry, will allow physicians to more quickly and accurately identify a patient s infection, leading to more accurate and quicker treatment.  Rapid and accurate pathogen detection and identification is sorely needed in hospitals and clinics to allow physicians to react and respond appropriately to potentially life threatening infections,  says Goodlett, who is also director of the School of Pharmacy s Mass Spectrometry Center.  So often we hear about patients who were given antibiotics for an infection that wasn t properly diagnosed because of limitations with the diagnostic process. Antibiotics can be damaging to the kidneys and the bone and can lead to issues with antibiotic resistance, so we want to improve upon existing diagnostic tests in order to improve treatment.  The current methods for diagnosing bacterial infections that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration include biological culture, nucleic acid amplification, ribosomal protein sequence characterization, and genome sequencing.  Collectively, these methods are slow, require amplification of clinically-obtained material, and are often significantly expensive and burdensome for diagnostic laboratory staff,  says Ernst.  Our study aims to create a library of chemically barcoded bacteria that can be checked to determine which infection a patient has. This will ultimately be faster, cheaper, and more accurate.  In order to improve the rapid and accurate diagnosis of bacterial infections, Goodlett and Ernst will use a mass spectrometry technique called matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, or MALDI.  Through this study, we will develop, refine, and use ultra-small scale purification methodologies for the extraction of essential, high abundance lipids from Gram-positive and  negative bacteria, as well as fungi,  says Goodlett.  These lipids are found in all membranes of microbes and are a highly diverse set of molecules. This diversity forms the basis of our hypothesis that essential bacterial and fungal lipids constitute a chemical barcode that can be used to identify pathogens by mass spectrometry profiling.  Goodlett s and Ernst s preliminary data show that these lipid structures are unique and can be used as novel chemical barcodes for the identification of bacterial and fungal infections and resistance patterns to a subset of antibiotic and antimicrobial peptides.  Lipids will be analyzed by mass spectrometry with the results used to generate a mass spectral signature library of lipid  fingerprints  from a wide variety of clinically-relevant pathogens,  says Ernst.  The combined analysis of the protein and the lipid will provide a greater than 99 percent accuracy level in identifying bacteria from a variety of human samples.   The methods Drs. Goodlett and Ernst are developing will change how infections are diagnosed in clinics, dropping the time it takes from days to hours,  says Andrew Coop, PhD, professor and chair of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the School of Pharmacy.  Their collective expertise in infectious diseases and mass spectrometry, combined with the extensive resources of the Mass Spectrometry Center, will translate into improvements in patient care.  In order to translate the technology fueling the bacterial library concept into commercially available products that benefit patients, Goodlett and Ernst are working with the University of Maryland, Baltimore s (UMB) Office of Technology Transfer to identify companies interested in developing the needed software for the project and to assist with the development of assays to detect the bacteria. ""Our office is very excited about this technology,"" said Phil Robilotto, assistant vice president of the Office of Technology Transfer at UMB and chief commercialization officer for UM Ventures. ""Drs. Goodlett and Ernst are developing a truly novel point-of-care pathogen identification product. The BacLib detection system's speed and ability to utilize clinical samples without culture makes the system extremely promising from both a patient care and commercial perspective.""","Published: April 21, 2015"

Results of the early-phase clinical trial of the therapy, called MPDL3280A, which aims to restore the immune system s ability to recognize and attack cancer cells, are expected to be presented at the American Association for Cancer Research s 2015 Annual Meeting in Philadelphia from April 18-22. Triple-negative breast cancer cells lack expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 protein, the established targets for breast cancer therapies. The small study was conducted on 54 patients treated at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center and several other institutions.   Early data in this trial show that the drug is generally safe and well-tolerated, and it appears to be able to control disease in some of these patients,  says Leisha Emens, M.D., Ph.D., an associate professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  Now we ll need to test it further in more patients and compare it with standard therapies to establish its therapeutic value.  Specifically, the researchers say the drug is designed to disrupt a pathway that hides tumor cells from immune system cells capable of attacking cancer cells. Among the components of the pathway are two proteins called programmed death-1 (PD-1), expressed on the surface of immune cells, and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), expressed on cancer cells and some immune cells. When the two proteins bind together, the biochemical pairing decreases the activity of the immune system, disarming its ability to attack cancer cells. Cancer is characterized by cells that get around the normal cell death process that is programmed into living cells. MPDL3280A binds to the PD-L1 protein and disrupts the connection with PD-1 proteins on immune cells. Of the 54 patients with triple-negative breast cancer evaluated, 37 had evidence of PD-L1 proteins on at least 5 percent of immune cells found within samples of the patients  tumors. Most of the patients in the trial experienced at least one low-grade side effect, such as nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, fever and decreased appetite. Six patients experienced more severe side effects, including vomiting, anemia and low white cell counts. No deaths among the patients have been connected to side effects of the drug thus far, the researchers say, although two deaths in the group are being evaluated. Of the 37 PD-L1-positive patients, 21 underwent evaluation to assess the possible impact of the drug on disease control. Six patients survived at least 24 weeks without progression of their breast cancer, a finding not typical of most patients with metastatic, triple-negative disease, according to Emens. Two of those patients had complete responses, indicating their tumors shrunk completely, and another two had partial responses. Patients in the trial have been followed for an average of 40 weeks.  Identifying a way to predict ahead of treatment which patients are more likely to respond is also important. There are ongoing efforts to identify biomarkers for cancer patients who are more likely to respond to this therapy,  says Emens. Patients with triple-negative breast cancer generally have worse prognosis than other breast cancer patients, according to Emens. Besides surgery and radiation, drug treatments have been limited to standard chemotherapy agents. The investigators say they chose to test this type of immunotherapy in this patient group because other studies have shown that patients  triple-negative breast tumors may contain more PD-L1 proteins and certain cancer-fighting immune cells within them than other breast cancer subtypes. Triple-negative breast cancers also mutate at a higher rate than other cancers, she says, which increases the likelihood that cancer cells will create abnormal proteins foreign to the immune system and raise the alarm for destruction by the immune system. MPDL3280A is being developed and manufactured by Genentech Inc., which also funded the study. Emens has received research funding from Genentech for another clinical trial and a research grant from Roche. She also has received research funding from Merck, EMD Serono, Amplimmune and Maxcyte, and she has consulted for Vaccinex, Celgene, Aveo and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Under a licensing agreement between Aduro Inc. and The Johns Hopkins University, the university and Emens are entitled to milestone payments and royalty on sales of the GM-CSF-secreting breast cancer vaccine. The terms of these arrangements are being managed by The Johns Hopkins University in accordance with its conflict of interest policies. Emens is a member of the Food and Drug Administration s Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee.

Conducted at Cincinnati Children s Hospital Medical Center, the study also identifies a genetic pathway that could open the possibility of new therapies for difficult-to-treat patients. The findings are reported April 21 in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, published by the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology. The researchers performed genome-wide analysis of nasal epithelial cells collected from children experiencing acute asthma exacerbation. They compared genetic expression and medical responses in children who responded well to corticosteroids therapy to those who did not.  Genome-wide analysis allowed us to identify a gene, VNN-1, whose expression discriminated between good and poor responders to systemic corticosteroid treatment,  said Gurjit Khurana Hershey, MD, PhD, senior author and director of Asthma Research at Cincinnati Children s.  This may serve as a clinically useful biomarker to identify a subset of difficult-to-treat asthmatic children, and targeting the VNN-1 pathway may be useful as a therapeutic strategy.  Asthma affects close to 26 million people in the United States, 7 million of them children. Although people suffering from asthma share similar clinical symptoms, it is triggered by multiple genetic and environmental factors. This makes asthma a series of respiratory syndromes that can be difficult to study and treat and personalized therapeutic management is needed to achieve the best outcomes, according to the researchers. Less-than-optimal management of childhood asthma is highlighted by the fact that nearly two-thirds of asthmatic children report at least one attack a year. And researchers estimate that effective treatment is either absent or incomplete in 40-70 percent of cases, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. This includes the subset of children who do not respond well to systemic corticosteroid therapy.  Difficult-to-treat patients account for over 50 percent of health care costs associated with asthma,  Hershey said.  There are new drugs that may be helpful, as well as those that affect the VNN-1 pathway, but they have not been tested in asthma. This study provides the basis for a biomarker to determine which patients might be best to target with new treatments.  The study included 57 children between ages 5 and 18 who were admitted through the Emergency Department at Cincinnati Children s and hospitalized for treatment of their asthma. In an initial group of patients experiencing asthma attack, nasal epithelia cells were collected and tested for comparative VNN-1 expression. Researchers then tested a second group of patients to verify results of the first group. Starting with a candidate list of 20,000 genes, researchers screened down to eight before singling out VNN-1 as the primary target. They conducted a series of cell biology tests in the lab to show that VNN-1 expression is required for inhaled corticoids to work during asthma attack. In cells from patients whose asthma did not respond well to treatment, researchers found a biochemical variation in the VNN-1 molecular network that hindered its expression. The researchers next tested and confirmed their clinical findings in laboratory mouse models of asthma, and produced data suggesting that targeting the VNN-1 pathway therapeutically might be a way to improve outcomes for difficult-to-treat asthmatic children. Testing continues in laboratory models to better determine the VNN-1 pathway s role in contributing to airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness in asthma. Researchers are also testing drugs that target the VNN-1 pathway to determine which, if any, might improve treatment for asthmatic children who do not respond to current treatments. Enhanced expression of VNN-1 is associated with multiple human diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, immune thrombocytopenia and system lupus erythematosus. This is the first study to report improperly regulated expression of VNN-1 and its mRNA (which help translate and transmit genetic information) in asthma. Collaborating with Hershey were first author, Chang Xiao, MD, PhD, a member of Hershey s laboratory team, and researchers from the divisions of Allergy and Immunology, Human Genetics, Hospital Medicine, Emergency Medicine and Pulmonary Medicine at Cincinnati Children s, and the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.

Saski participated in sequencing the genome, which is a crucial stepping-stone toward further advancements of understanding the inner workings of one of the most complex and treasured plants on the planet.The future implications of Saski s research in the short and long terms are both financial and holistic. Upland cotton, which accounts for more than 90 percent of cultivated cotton worldwide and has a global economic impact of $500 billion, is the main source of renewable textile fibers. The genome sequence, unveiled Monday in the renowned scientific journal Nature Biotechnology, will provide the know-how to engineer superior lines that will clothe, feed and fuel the ever-expanding human population.  From the discovery standpoint   having a solid foundation to begin measuring genetic diversity and how the genes are organized   this is a game-changer,  said Saski, director of Clemson s Genomics and Computational Biology Laboratory.  With a genome map and genetically diverse populations, you can reveal the biology and DNA signature underlying cotton fiber development. Then you can use this information to breed cotton lines with advanced fiber elongation and fiber strength, which are crucial to the industry. This first draft of the genome sequence is a solid foundation for unlocking cotton s mysteries.  Upland cotton, which has an economic impact of $205 million in South Carolina alone, came into existence more than a million years ago when two separate species hybridized, creating a plant that has multiple genomes. Unlike humans, who have two sets of chromosomes (from a mother and a father), the Upland cotton genome is configured with four sets, adding multiple layers of complexity for scientists such as Saski.  You can only imagine the confounding problems that can occur when you have multiple genomes,  said Saski.  I m interested in the process underlying polyploidization and how a better understanding of this complexity can be leveraged to breed better cotton.  Saski s U.S based consortium, which includes Brian Scheffler of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, David Stelly of Texas A&M, Don Jones of Cotton Inc. and Jeffrey Chen of the University of Texas at Austin, traveled to Nanjing Agriculture University in eastern China. There they worked with a team led by professors Tianzhen Zhang and Ruiqiang Li to assemble the draft genome.  China is the largest cotton-producing country in the world,  said Saski, whose initial research on the project began more than four years ago.  In the end, we were successful in setting the stage for using DNA information to inform and benefit breeders.  Upland cotton is one of South Carolina s foundational commodity crops. It has been grown since the time of the American Revolution, and it remains a staple crop to this day. It is also South Carolina s leading agricultural export. Cotton breeders are being challenged to release new varieties suitable for drought-like conditions and high salinity soils, and that are also better able to resist constant threats from pests and diseases.  The techniques and approach Saski and his collaborators are applying to decode the complex cotton genome will have a profound impact on the way cotton is improved through breeding,  said Stephen Kresovich, Coker Chair of Genetics and director of Clemson s Institute of Translational Genomics.  These insights will also advance our understanding of polyploidy genetics, which is so common in crop plants.  The cotton genome that produces spinnable fibers is extremely complex because of the presence of multiple genomes, a phenomenon that occurs in about 80 percent of all plant species.  Saski and his colleagues have developed innovative strategies to dissect the cotton genome using comparative genomics, genetics, computational biology and high-performance computing,  said Kresovich.  The results of this work will have a direct impact in the discovery of novel traits in cotton and related species and will set the stage for accelerated agronomic improvement. As the future unfolds, South Carolina will certainly be a major benefactor. ","Published: April 21, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/ovarian-cancer-update-204578,Ovarian Cancer Update Medical University of Vienna has published results in support of the use of ANGLE s Parsortix system  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. ANGLE plc has announced that the Medical University of Vienna, one of its key opinion leaders, has published highly encouraging results in support of the use of ANGLE s Parsortix system in the detection of ovarian cancer. Further to the announcement on 27 January 2015, the Medical University of Vienna has extended the work undertaken and published results from its work with the Parsortix system at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2015 being held in Philadelphia ( AACR ). AACR is one of the world s largest and most influential cancer conferences. Following the results announced in January, the Medical University of Vienna submitted an abstract and we are extremely pleased that this was accepted for publication as a poster at the conference, which is released. Professor Robert Zeillinger and Dr Eva Obermayr are attending the conference to support the poster. The poster can be downloaded from the ANGLE website here http://www.angleplc.com/the-parsortix-system/download-files/. The poster significantly extends the work announced in January in terms of the number of patients analyzed, the types of cancers considered and the performance achieved. The study evaluated a total of 65 patients, comprising 42 cancer patients and 23 healthy normal volunteers. The cancer patients consisted of 24 ovarian cancer, 6 cervical cancer, 5 endometrial cancer and 7 breast cancer cases. The analysis of 7 RNA markers yielded 100% specificity, which indicates no false positives, a major problem with existing techniques. The sensitivity of ovarian cancer was 80% at the point of diagnosis and 78% at relapse, which compares favourably to the 24.5% sensitivity, which is the best that has been achieved with other circulating tumour cell ( CTC ) systems. The important new data shows that a sensitivity of 71% was achieved with the metastatic breast cancer patients, which is more than twice as high as achieved in studies using other CTC systems. To improve the sensitivity further, the Medical University of Vienna reanalyzed the RNA information using 30 RNA markers with the thresholds set for 100% specificity. So far this work has been completed for 13 of the cancer patients. The addition of 23 further RNA markers yielded an increased sensitivity level averaging 92% across all the cancer types. Notably the sensitivity and specificity for the 7 ovarian cancer patients that were re-analyzed were both 100% at diagnosis and at relapse. This meant that all the ovarian cancer patients were correctly identified using the Parsortix blood test and there were no false positives or false negatives. Larger sample sizes will be needed to complete optimization and confirm these improved results. With this new highly sensitive approach, the Medical University of Vienna undertook analysis of a woman at high risk of developing ovarian and breast cancer as a result of BRCA1/2 mutation. The woman appeared healthy, had no symptoms and conventional diagnosis including ultrasound and the CA-125 serum tumour marker indicated that she was disease-free. However, like Angelina Jolie, the woman elected to undergo risk-reducing surgery to remove her ovaries. The Parsortix blood sample taken prior to surgery indicated that the woman was positive for ovarian cancer. This was initially thought to be a false positive. However, contrary to all the medical expectations and results from conventional diagnosis, when the surgery was undertaken the woman was in fact found to have ovarian cancer. This is only one case but it demonstrates the exceptional sensitivity of the Parsortix system and may provide a monitoring option for the approximately 1 in 380 women worldwide who are BRCA1/2 positive and at high risk of developing cancer. The Medical University of Vienna is now progressing a multi-centre prospective clinical study in ovarian cancer, which is expected to take around 18 months to complete. ANGLE is supporting this effort as a top priority. ANGLE s Parsortix system together with the RNA marker panel has the potential to help inform clinical decision-making for ovarian cancer patients in:  Detection of cancer in high risk or genetically pre-disposed patients (detection)  Monitoring therapy and selection of therapies in treatment of ovarian cancer patients (therapy monitoring)  Monitoring of ovarian cancer patients in remission for early detection of relapse (remission monitoring) ANGLE estimates that the ovarian cancer sales potential for the Parsortix system in Europe and the United States would be in excess of  300 million per annum. Dr Eva Obermayr, Principal Investigator at the Medical University of Vienna, commented:  The Parsortix technology contributes to the unprecedented specificity and sensitivity of the overall approach, by providing a high purity CTC sample. Parsortix is a label-free technology, and as such may become the gold standard for ovarian cancer diagnosis. By combining the Parsortix technology with qPCR analysis, we achieved an unprecedented high detection rate of cancer, even in early stage patients, where conventional diagnostic methods failed.  Professor Robert Zeillinger, Head of the Molecular Oncology Group at the Medical University of Vienna, commented:  It is now evident that the Parsortix system has wide application not just in ovarian cancer but in breast cancer and other gynaecological cancers as well. We are delighted to be working with ANGLE to bring this new capability to our patients as soon as possible.  ANGLE Founder and Chief Executive, Andrew Newland, commented:  The prospect of a simple blood test for cancer detection with such high sensitivity and specificity is extremely exciting. The results published today by Medical University of Vienna substantiate the early findings in ovarian cancer and extend the opportunity into breast cancer and other gynaecological cancers.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/antibiotic-mechanism-discovered-186634,Antibiotic Mechanism Discovered A structural study revealed how an antibiotic called borrelidin stops bacterial growth   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The widespread use of antibiotics in modern society has led to a sharp rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. As a result, much research has focused on creating new compounds to fight these bacteria. Borrelidin was isolated from the bacteria Streptomyces about 50 years ago. The compound has broad antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, anticancer, insecticidal, and herbicidal activities. It works by interfering with a type of essential enzyme called tRNA synthetase. These enzymes help cells make proteins through a process called translation. Their role is to attach amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) to molecules called transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which help add amino acids to a growing protein chain. Borrelidin blocks the action of threonyl-tRNA synthetase, thereby preventing the amino acid L-threonine from linking to its tRNA. The linking reaction occurs at the enzyme s active site and also involves the energy molecule ATP. A research team led by Dr. Min Guo of the Scripps Research Institute investigated how borrelidin interferes with threonyl-tRNA synthetase. They used a technique called X-ray crystallography to decipher the structure of the enzyme when borrelidin interacts with it. The study was funded in part by NIH s National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS). Results appeared in Nature Communications on March 31, 2015. The researchers found that borrelidin simultaneously occupies the enzyme binding sites for L-threonine, tRNA, and ATP. Thus, the compound blocks all 3 molecules from the synthetase s active site. As a result, L-threonine can t be linked to its tRNA, and protein translation fails. The researchers determined that borrelidin binding also causes a change to the structure of the enzyme that creates a fourth spot for borrelidin attachment. In a series of experiments, they confirmed the importance of this extra binding site for translation. Thus, borrelidin inhibits translation by binding to 4 sites that are necessary for threonyl-tRNA synthetase to function.  This has never been seen in any other tRNA synthetase inhibitors, including the ones sold as medicines,  Guo says.  This finding establishes a new inhibitor class and highlights the striking design of this natural compound that inhibits tRNA synthetases in 2 of the 3 kingdoms of life.  Researchers have been investigating the potential of tRNA synthetase inhibitors to fight bacteria, fungi, cancers, and autoimmune diseases. The insights from this research may help guide scientists in the rational design of improved, more selective drugs.","Published: April 21, 2015"

The findings suggest that routine genetic screening of children with CKD could lead to earlier and more precise diagnoses, as well as to more personalized monitoring, prevention, and treatment. Details of the study were published in the online issue of the Journal of Clinical investigation.  With conventional clinical findings, we often cannot determine the exact cause of CKD in children,  said study leader Ali G. Gharavi, MD, professor of medicine and chief of the Division of Nephrology at CUMC.  However, our study shows that using a readily available genetic screening tool called chromosomal microarray analysis, it s possible in many cases to reach a more precise diagnosis and uncover information that can help define a patient s risk for other disorders, such as autism or diabetes.  About 13 percent of Americans are affected by CKD. The disease is particularly serious in children, often leading to complications like high blood pressure, heart disease, neurodevelopmental problems, and behavioral deficits. Roughly half of all cases of CKD in children are caused by birth defects, such as an underdeveloped or missing kidney. CKD can also result from hereditary diseases, infection, toxic exposures, and autoimmune disorders. In many patients, the cause cannot be determined. Dr. Gharavi, together with lead author Miguel Verbistky, PhD, associate research scientist, and their colleagues, hypothesized that copy number variations (CNVs) gain or loss of bits of DNA might provide insights into the cause of CKD in children. The team performed chromosomal microarray analyses of 419 children enrolled in the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) Prospective Cohort Study to determine the prevalence of disease-causing CNVs among various categories of pediatric CKD. The data were compared with genomic data on 21,575 healthy pediatric and adult controls. The researchers found significant CNVs in 31, or 7.4 percent, of the 419 children with CKD (roughly ten-fold the percentage seen in the controls). The most frequent CNVs were deletions in the HNF1B gene. Loss of HNF1B function is associated with renal cysts and diabetes syndrome, which increases one s susceptibility to kidney malformations, diabetes, and cognitive disorders, among other conditions. Many of the other CNVs that were uncovered were associated with developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and seizure disorders. Of the 31 children with significant CNVs, 28 had genetic diagnoses that differed from the clinical diagnosis or that added information that would have altered the care of the patient, according to the study.  Because kidney problems can be detected early by blood tests, or even by prenatal imaging studies, this offers the opportunity for screening and detecting genomic imbalances before other complications, such as developmental delay, become clinically apparent,  said Dr. Verbistky.  Our findings should change clinical practice,  said Dr. Gharavi.  Routine genetic screening of kids with CKD would not only improve diagnosis but also help identify those at risk for complications like diabetes and subclinical seizures, which benefit from early detection and treatment.  The findings also shed light on why children with CKD tend to perform less well in school than their peers.  The prevailing hypothesis,  said Dr. Gharavi,  is that their poor academic performance is due simply to impaired kidney function and the burden of having a chronic illness. But our data suggest that these kids may be underperforming because of an underlying genetic lesion that affects both kidney and neurologic function. If so, it s important that we identify these potential problems and intervene as early as possible. ","Published: April 21, 2015"

The data presented indicate that APR-246 can be combined with standard chemotherapy, that preliminary efficacy data indicate that the combination regimen has activity in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, and that no new safety concerns have emerged in the first treatment cohort. Aprea s first-in-class lead candidate drug APR-246 reactivates the tumor suppressor protein p53 which is deficient in around 50% of all human tumors, mainly due to mutations of its DNA-binding domain. The mutations result in loss of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis which is an important growth control mechanism that protects against tumor growth. In addition, mutations in p53 or its regulators are associated with increased resistance to standard chemotherapy and hence poor prognosis. Aprea s Phase Ib/II PiSARRO trial investigates the safety and efficacy of APR-246 in combination with carboplatin and doxorubicin in second-line treatment of patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer. The poster presented at the AACR Annual Meeting shows preliminary results for the first dosing cohort with three patients in the Phase Ib part of the study.  The data on the first three patients in the PiSARRO study indicates that APR-246 can be used in this combination regimen for the intended patient group and we have not seen any new safety concerns. Also, early indications of activity have been observed with partial RECIST responses from all three patients. However, while these data are encouraging, we are also careful not to draw any conclusions from these first patients in the dose escalation part of the study that does not have a control arm. We are now awaiting the full Phase Ib results,  comments Ulf Bj rklund, CEO of Aprea. In addition, Aprea will also present two posters at the AACR Annual Meeting with preclinical data of APR-246, showing strong synergistic response with APR-246 and chemotherapy in ex vivo cancer cells from ovarian cancer and lung cancer cells respectively.","Published: April 21, 2015"

According to a study published in Nature, researchers discovered that these drugs may activate stem cells in the brain to stimulate myelin producing cells and repair white matter, which is damaged in multiple sclerosis. The study was partially funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health. Specialized cells called oligodendrocytes lay down multiple layers of a fatty white substance known as myelin around axons, the long  wires  that connect brain cells. Myelin acts as an insulator and enables fast communication between brain cells. In multiple sclerosis there is breakdown of myelin and this deterioration leads to muscle weakness, numbness and problems with vision, coordination and balance.  To replace damaged cells, the scientific field has focused on direct transplantation of stem cell-derived tissues for regenerative medicine, and that approach is likely to provide enormous benefit down the road. We asked if we could find a faster and less invasive approach by using drugs to activate native nervous system stem cells and direct them to form new myelin. Our ultimate goal was to enhance the body s ability to repair itself,  said Paul J. Tesar, Ph.D., associate professor at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, and senior author of the study. It is unknown how myelin-producing cells are damaged, but research suggests they may be targeted by malfunctioning immune cells and that multiple sclerosis may start as an autoimmune disorder. Current therapies for multiple sclerosis include anti-inflammatory drugs, which help prevent the episodic relapses common in multiple sclerosis, but are less effective at preventing long-term disability. Scientists believe that therapies that promote myelin repair might improve neurologic disability in people with multiple sclerosis. Adult brains contain oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which are stem cells that generate myelin-producing cells. OPCs are found to multiply in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients as if to respond to myelin damage, but for unknown reasons they are not effective in restoring white matter. In the current study, Dr. Tesar wanted to see if drugs already approved for other uses were able to stimulate OPCs to increase myelination. OPCs have been difficult to isolate and study, but Dr. Tesar and his colleagues, in collaboration with Robert Miller, Ph.D., professor at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., developed a novel method to investigate these cells in a petri dish. Using this technique, they were able to quickly test the effects of hundreds of drugs on the stem cells. The compounds screened in this study were obtained from a drug library maintained by NIH s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). All are approved for use in humans. NCATS and Dr. Tesar have an ongoing collaboration and plan to expand the library of drugs screened against OPCs in the near future to identify other promising compounds. Dr. Tesar s team found that two compounds in particular, miconazole (an antifungal) and clobetasol (a steroid), stimulated mouse and human OPCs into generating myelin-producing cells. Next, they examined whether the drugs, when injected into a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, could improve re-myelination. They found that both drugs were effective in activating OPCs to enhance myelination and reverse paralysis. As a result, almost all of the animals regained the use of their hind limbs. They also found that the drugs acted through two very different molecular mechanisms.  The ability to activate white matter cells in the brain, as shown in this study, opens up an exciting new avenue of therapy development for myelin disorders such as multiple sclerosis,  said Ursula Utz, Ph.D., program director at the NINDS. Dr. Tesar and his colleagues caution that more research is needed before miconazole and clobetasol can be tested in multiple sclerosis clinical trials. They are currently approved for use as creams or powders on the surfaces of the body but their safety administered in other forms, such as injections, in humans is unknown.  Off-label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms. We are working tirelessly to ready a safe and effective drug for clinical use,  Dr. Tesar said.","Published: April 21, 2015"

The results are being published as a poster at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2015 being held in Philadelphia ( AACR ). AACR is one of the world s largest and most influential cancer conferences. The poster can be downloaded from the ANGLE website here http://www.angleplc.com/the-parsortix-system/download-files/. A key challenge in investigating the metastatic process and improving the therapeutic benefit of cancer treatment is the heterogeneity (genetic variability) of the cancer cells. There are major potential benefits if circulating tumour cells (CTCs) can be harvested from patient blood and then processed individually one-by-one as intact cells for analysis. Technically this requires a high performance CTC capture and harvesting system that provides harvested CTCs in a form capable of then being processed by a single cell analysis system. The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University have successfully tested the Parsortix system in combination with the single cell analysis DEPArray system to isolate single cancer cells from blood samples spiked with cultured breast cancer cells. The team proved the ability to manipulate the individual cancer cells from the Parsortix system and to correctly identify two breast cancer related genes (Estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and p53) on the cells using standard PCR analysis techniques. The research collaboration was led by Dr Massimo Cristofanilli, an internationally renowned breast cancer researcher and clinician, and Director of the Jefferson Breast Care Center at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center and Thomas Jefferson University and Hospitals. Dr Cristofanilli has been an acknowledged leader in the CTC field since 2004, when his study on CTCs was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The work will now focus on molecular analysis in specified disease status and treatment settings to better identify clinical applications for more effective treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer. Dr Massimo Cristofanilli, Director of the Jefferson Breast Care Center at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center and Thomas Jefferson University and Hospitals, commented:  We demonstrated that using the Parsortix system in conjunction with DEPArray we are able to isolate single, uncontaminated tumor cells to achieve single cell molecular analysis. The use of single cells is emerging as a powerful approach to molecular analysis in oncology. The Parsortix system has the ability to advance molecular testing, study cancer heterogeneity and apply concepts of precision medicine to breast cancer patients  care.  ANGLE Founder and Chief Executive, Andrew Newland, commented:  The ability to capture and harvest individual CTCs for routine analysis is an important step that has proved extremely difficult until now. Our aim is that the Parsortix system will provide a simple and effective way to harvest CTCs for mutation, gene expression and other types of molecular analysis so that there is a way to determine which drugs may benefit individual patients.

The article reviews the significant body of research proposing that the accumulation of beta amyloid in the brain is the Alzheimer's disease trigger that must be inhibited. Future Science OA is an online, open access, peer-reviewed title from Future Science Group. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia in the elderly, affecting more than 36 million people worldwide, and no drugs have yet been proven to halt the progression of this degenerative disease. Significant research has focused on a theory known as the Amyloid Hypothesis, which suggests that the accumulation of a small protein fragment, beta amyloid or A , within brain tissue is the event which triggers Alzheimer's disease. A  is a derivative of the longer Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). The article reviews research efforts that have attempted to inhibit the generation of A  by modulating the secretase proteins that cut the APP into A . The article reviews both the successes and failures of A  clinical trials, and the risks and rewards of continuing to pursue this line of research. ""This review outlines the role of the proteolytic secretases to produce beta amyloid peptide as part of the ""Amyloid Hypothesis"" of Alzheimer's disease,"" said the authors, of the Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow. ""We examine the current status of the secretases as therapeutic targets in AD and speculate as to the viability of the AD hypothesis as a whole in light of recent findings.""

Through detailed computer models and experiments on two distinct glioblastoma cell types, the Rice lab of bioengineer Amina Qutub has found reason to believe therapies that attack the insulin signaling pathway thought to influence tumor development have had mixed results in trials because they go after the wrong targets. The research, which appears this month in PLOS Computational Biology, provides deeper understanding of interactions between key factors in the insulin signaling pathway that influence the growth of glioblastomas. Studies have shown that patients who are obese, diabetic or both have the highest incidence of glioblastomas, the deadliest form of cancer and one that has proven nearly unbeatable. ""There have been high-profile papers on diabetes and obesity as risk factors not only for cancer in general but for far more aggressive brain tumors,"" Qutub said. The new work led by Rice graduate student Ka Wai Lin is the first to establish, through a computer model, mechanisms that show why some brain tumors are insulin-sensitive while others appear to be insulin-insensitive. He said earlier experimental studies have looked at two aspects of the insulin pathway suspected of influencing glioblastomas, but they were never considered in tandem until now. Medications that have reached the clinical trial stage focused on the insulin growth factor protein known as IGF1 and its connection to a transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor 1a (HIF1a), an oxygen sensor continually produced in cells and degraded if sufficient oxygen is present. HIF1a has been implicated in glioblastoma progression. The Rice model suggested the pathway from another growth protein -- IGFBP2 -- to the HIF1a transcription factor is, by comparison, more integral to the growth of the malignant brain tumors and a worthy target for future therapeutic studies. The failure of medications that focused on the IGF1 pathway to move from success in animal models to similar success in human trials shows the need for a new approach, Qutub said. Her lab at Rice's BioScience Research Collaborative studies molecular-signaling pathways through computer models and experimentation with a focus on hypoxia, or oxygen starvation, and its effect on biological systems. ""They have been focusing on the right pathway, but the wrong molecules in that pathway,"" Qutub said. ""While the insulin pathway has been studied in cancer for many decades, IGFBP2-HIF1a signaling feedback has never been tested in the way Ka Wai explored."" Patient responses to drugs that affect the insulin pathway depend on the type of tumor, she said. ""In vitro and in patients, some glioblastomas are sensitive to insulin and others aren't. We're saying that for those who are -- and many are -- you really need to target the pathway we're describing."" Lin is preparing experiments on glioblastoma cells in collaboration with Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine to see how the cells respond to stimuli that affect the pathways. ""It's not just the growth that kills you; it's also the movement and the metastasis of the cells,"" he said. The researchers will use the findings to assess the model's validity. Qutub noted ""the jury is out"" as other recent studies suggest diabetes might actually reduce the risk of glioblastoma, while others say exercise and glucose control can cut risk. Computational modeling of all the possibilities can help clarify the picture, she said. ""By modeling, we can test different scenarios rapidly before going back into the lab, without being wedded to a particular animal model or subset of human studies,"" Qutub said.

Led by researchers at Case Western Reserve, a multi-institutional team used a new discovery approach to identify drugs that could activate mouse and human brain stem cells in the laboratory. The two most potent drugs -- one that currently treats athlete's foot, and the other, eczema -- were capable of stimulating the regeneration of damaged brain cells and reversing paralysis when administered systemically to animal models of multiple sclerosis. The results are published online in the journal Nature. ""We know that there are stem cells throughout the adult nervous system that are capable of repairing the damage caused by multiple sclerosis, but until now, we had no way to direct them to act,"" said Paul Tesar, PhD, the Dr. Donald and Ruth Weber Goodman Professor of Innovative Therapeutics, and associate professor in the Department of Genetics & Genome Sciences at the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. ""Our approach was to find drugs that could catalyze the body's own stem cells to replace the cells lost in multiple sclerosis."" The findings mark the most promising developments to date in efforts to help the millions of people around the world who suffer from multiple sclerosis. The disease is the most common chronic neurological disorder among young adults, and results from aberrant immune cells destroying the protective myelin coating, around nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Without myelin, neural signals cannot be transmitted properly along nerves; over time, a patient's ability to walk, hold a cup or even see is inexorably eroded. Current multiple sclerosis therapies aim to slow further myelin destruction by the immune system, but the Case Western Reserve team used a new approach to create new myelin within the nervous system. Their work offers great promise of developing therapies that reverse disabilities caused by multiple sclerosis or similar neurological disorders. ""To replace damaged cells, much of the stem cell field has focused on direct transplantation of stem cell-derived tissues for regenerative medicine, and that approach is likely to provide enormous benefit down the road,"" said Tesar, also a New York Stem Cell Foundation Robertson Investigator and member of the National Center for Regenerative Medicine. ""But here we asked if we could find a faster and less invasive approach by using drugs to activate native stem cells already in the adult nervous system and direct them to form new myelin. Our ultimate goal was to enhance the body's ability to repair itself."" Tesar emphasized that much work remains before multiple sclerosis patients might benefit from the promising approach. Scientists still must find ways to transform the topical medications for internal use and determine their long-term efficacy and potential side effects. That said, using existing, federally approved drugs enhances the likelihood that the compounds can be made safe for human use. Tesar and his colleagues could zero in on the two catalyzing medications only because of a breakthrough that his laboratory achieved in 2011. Specifically, the researchers developed a unique process to create massive quantities of a special type of stem cell called an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC). These OPCs are normally found throughout the adult brain and spinal cord, and therefore inaccessible to study. But once Tesar and his team could produce billions of the OPCs with relative ease, they could begin to test different existing drug formulations to determine which, if any, induced the OPCs to form new myelinating cells. Using a state-of-the-art imaging microscope, the investigators quantified the effects of 727 previously known drugs, all of which have a history of use in patients, on OPCs in the laboratory. The most promising medications fell into two specific chemical classes. From there, the researchers found that miconazole and clobetasol performed best within the respective classes. Miconazole is found in an array of over-the-counter antifungal lotions and powders, including those to treat athlete's foot. Clobetasol, meanwhile, is typically available by prescription to treat scalp and other skin conditions such as dermatitis. Neither had been previously considered as a therapeutic for multiple sclerosis, but testing revealed each had an ability to stimulate OPCs to form new myelinating cells. When administered systemically to lab mice afflicted with a multiple sclerosis-like disease, both drugs prompted native OPCs to regenerate new myelin. ""It was a striking reversal of disease severity in the mice,"" said Robert Miller, PhD, a member of the neurosciences faculty at Case Western Reserve who, with Tesar, is a co-senior author of the Nature paper. The two collaborated on this project while Miller also served as Vice President for Research at Case Western Reserve; since June his primary appointments are at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, where he is Senior Associate Dean for Research and Vivian Gill Distinguished Research Chair. ""The drugs that we identified are able to enhance the regenerative capacity of stem cells in the adult nervous system. This truly represents a paradigm shift in how we think about restoring function to multiple sclerosis patients."" While the drugs proved to have extraordinary effects on mice, their impact on human patients will not be known fully until actual clinical trials. Nevertheless, Tesar and his team already have added reason for optimism; in addition to the tests with animal cells, they also tested the drugs on human stem cells -- and saw the medication prompt a similar response as seen in the mouse cells. Both medications worked well, with miconazole demonstrating the more potent effects. ""We have pioneered technologies that enable us to generate both mouse and human OPCs in our laboratory,"" said Fadi Najm, MBA, the first author of the study and Research Scientist in the Department of Genetics & Genome Sciences at the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. ""This uniquely positioned us to test if these drugs could also stimulate human OPCs to generate new myelinating cells."" Tesar, who recently received the 2015 International Society for Stem Cell Research Outstanding Young Investigator Award, said investigators next will work to deepen their understanding of the mechanism by which these drugs act. Once these details are clear, researchers will modify the drugs to increase their effectiveness in people. The team is enthusiastic that optimized versions of these two drugs can be advanced to clinical testing for multiple sclerosis in the future, but Tesar emphasized the danger of trying to use current versions for systemic human administration. ""We appreciate that some patients or their families feel they cannot wait for the development of specific approved medications,"" Tesar said, ""but off-label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms. We are working tirelessly to ready a safe and effective drug for clinical use."" While multiple sclerosis is the initial focus for translating this research into the clinic, a number of other disorders involve myelin loss or dysfunction including cerebral palsy, age-related dementia, optic neuritis and schizophrenia. Any drugs developed that enhance myelination in multiple sclerosis also hold promise for benefiting these other disorders. ""The approach from Case Western Reserve University combines cutting-edge stem cell and drug screening technologies to develop new chemical therapeutics for myelin disorders,"" said Christopher Austin, MD, director of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NCATS researchers performed key external validation experiments as part of the study. ""It is clear that the discovery of drugs that control the function of stem cells in the body represents a promising new era in regenerative medicine.""

A study in 2013, also led by the School, suggested an initial link between a mutation in the ap2mu gene and low levels of malaria parasites remaining in the blood of Kenyan children after they had been treated. However, further research was needed to confirm if these genetic characteristics represented an early step towards resistance.In the new study, researchers genetically altered the malaria parasite in the laboratory to mutate ap2mu in the same way that had been observed in Kenya. They found the altered parasite was significantly less susceptible, requiring 32% more drug to be killed by artemisinin. The genetically altered parasite was also 42.4% less susceptible to the traditional antimalarial drug, quinine. Earlier this year a different research group discovered mutations in the gene kelch13 which were linked to reduced susceptibility to artemisinin combination treatment in South East Asia. Historically, resistance to antimalarial medicines has emerged in South East Asia and then spread to Africa. But these new findings suggest a different route to drug resistance may be developing independently in Africa. Lead researcher Dr Colin Sutherland, Reader in Parasitology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said:  Our findings could be a sign of much worse things to come for malaria in Africa. The malaria parasite is constantly evolving to evade our control efforts. We ve already moved away from using quinine to treat cases as the malaria parasite has become more resistant to it, but if further drug resistance were to develop against our most valuable malaria drug, artemisinin, we would be facing a grave situation.  We now know that the gene ap2mu is an important factor in determining how well our drugs kill malaria parasites. We will be conducting laboratory and field studies to more accurately measure the impact of mutations in the ap2mu gene. We hope our findings will help understand resistance of malaria to drugs, and potentially be an important tool for monitoring malaria treatment in the future.  The World Health Organization estimates more than half a million people die from malaria every year, mostly children under five.

That medical mystery is just one of the questions that Ruth Montgomery, associate professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine, seeks to explore with the use of a transformational tool for translational research. It s called CyTOF, which stands for cytometry by time-of-flight, and it gives researchers greater insight into the intricacies of immune cells than ever before. Established at Yale last year, the CyTOF tool is one of an estimated 90 in use by researchers and pharmaceutical companies around the world.  It really offers some advantages,  said Montgomery, who directs Yale s CyTOF facility at Yale School of Medicine.  Researchers who are eager to advance their discoveries are going to want to use the best technology they can.  With the technology, researchers studying a range of conditions   from West Nile to multiple sclerosis to diabetes to cancer   can generate an unprecedented level of detailed data about cells from relatively small samples. The data helps them identify previously undetected cell subsets, deepening their understanding of cell biology and human disease. Peering deeper into cell data Prior to the advent of CyTOF in 2009, scientists collected data about cell characteristics with an older technology known as flow cytometry. Using flow cytometry, researchers label cell components, such as surface markers or proteins, with flourescent probes attached to antibodies and pass those cells through lasers. When the lasers hit them, the fluorescent probes emit different wavelengths of light, which are detected by the cytometer and converted into readable data. Flow cytometry allows researchers to use 8 to 10 fluorescently labeled markers   typically antibodies   to capture data about key cell features. By contrast, CyTOF employs a technique called mass spectrometry and rare earth metals instead of fluorescent compounds, so scientists can use about 40 markers (and up to 100 in the future). That translates into four to five times more information. It s akin to the difference between looking at the stars with a standard telescope versus an observatory-quality refractor telescope, according to Yale s chair of neurology, Dr. David Hafler, who worked with Montgomery to bring CyTOF to Yale.  It allows me to go from seeing what s on the cell s surface, to defining function inside the cell very deeply,  he said.The search for cellular clues In the CyTOF facility that she directs, Montgomery applies the technology to her study of how aging impacts the immune response to infections and autoimmune diseases. Along with Yale colleagues in internal medicine and immunobiology, she authored a paper published in the Journal of Immunological Methods in 2014 that demonstrated the technology s ability to detect multiple signals from a sample of as little as 1,000-10,000 cells.  Specifically, she s using CyTOF to explore the role of natural killer (NK) cells in the immune response to West Nile virus.  Right now we re looking at NK cells from patients who had very severe West Nile virus and patients who never knew they were sick with West Nile virus, and we re characterizing their NK cells,  she explains. With a panel of 40 markers, Montgomery and her colleagues have already been able to discern distinctions between NK cells derived from the two patient groups. The research may help explain differences in immune response to infection that could potentially benefit those most harmed by the illness, notes Montgomery. Similarly, in his lab, Hafler applies CyTOF to the study of cellular complexities at the root of diseases such as a multiple sclerosis and cancer. In one current project, his team is investigating specific types of immune cells extracted from brain tumors.  We re isolating T cells from brain tumors,  he explains.  We re able to look at over 35 different functional molecules on the surface of T cells to define their function.  Understanding how multiple molecules function at the same time in a single cell may reveal clues about how brain tumors manage to survive and thrive in spite of T cells, he said.  The more we can define how the tumor is evading the immune system, the more specific we can make the treatment. By looking at multiple markers, we can be more precise in defining the therapy moving forward.  Eye on immune therapies and prevention In his lab, professor of immunology Dr. Kevan Herold has used the technology to explore key questions about type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition. CyTOF is helping his team get more data about a limited repertoire of cells specific to type 1 diabetes, which typically appears during childhood.  We want to understand the targets of the cells that cause diabetes,  he said.  What turns them on? What turns them off? Are there pathways involved that we can target for therapies? Those are the types of questions we re interested in.  The goal is not only to develop immune therapy to treat type 1 diabetes but potentially to use the data for prevention.  There are antigen-reactive T cells that are found in individuals at risk for type 1 diabetes,  said Herold.  Some of those individuals go on to develop diabetes; others don t. What we want to do is figure out who is going to go on to develop diabetes in order to prevent it.  If he identifies a marker that differentiates between patient types, for example, that finding could point to a target for preventive strategies, notes Herold. The work of Montgomery, Hafler, and Herold may be just the tip of the iceberg. With this more powerful tool for analyzing cells, Yale scientists now have the ability to deeply analyze and profile whole populations of immune cells for the study of cancer and other complex diseases. Their discoveries will contribute to the growing number of peer-reviewed studies involving CyTOF, and the immune therapies that emerge.  We tend to think of our analyses of cells as uni-dimensional or bi-dimensional. This now is 40-dimensional,  said Herold.  This approach, where you have many parameters, is probably going to redefine populations of T cells. It will enhance how we view the immune repertoire. ","Published: April 20, 2015"

The promising results will be further explored in a human clinical trial, which will recruit participants at high risk for head and neck cancer recurrence later this year. This research is funded through Pitt s Specialized Program of Research Excellence grant in head and neck cancer from the National Cancer Institute.  People who are cured of head and neck cancer are still at very high risk for a second cancer in their mouth or throat, and, unfortunately, these second cancers are commonly fatal,  said lead author Julie Bauman, M.D., M.P.H., co-director of the UPMC Head and Neck Cancer Center of Excellence.  So we re developing a safe, natural molecule found in cruciferous vegetables to protect the oral lining where these cancers form.  Previous studies, including large-scale trials in China, have shown that cruciferous vegetables that have a high concentration of sulforaphane   such as broccoli, cabbage and garden cress   help mitigate the effects of environmental carcinogens. Dr. Bauman collaborated with Daniel E. Johnson, Ph.D., professor of medicine at Pitt and a senior scientist in the UPCI Head and Neck Cancer Program, to test sulforaphane in the laboratory. For several months, Dr. Johnson and his team gave sulforaphane to mice predisposed to oral cancer and found that it significantly reduced the incidence and number of tumors.    The clear benefit of sulforaphane in preventing oral cancer in mice raises hope that this well-tolerated compound also may act to prevent oral cancer in humans who face chronic exposure to environmental pollutants and carcinogens,  said Dr. Johnson.     Dr. Bauman treated 10 healthy volunteers with fruit juice mixed with sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprout extract. The volunteers had no ill-effects from the extract and protective changes were detectable in the lining of their mouths, meaning it was absorbed and directed to at-risk tissue. These findings were enough to prompt a clinical trial that will recruit 40 volunteers who have been curatively treated for head and neck cancer. The participants will regularly take capsules containing broccoli seed powder to determine if they can tolerate the regimen and whether it has enough of an impact on their oral lining to prevent cancer. From there, larger clinical trials could be warranted.  We call this  green chemoprevention,  where simple seed preparations or plant extracts are used to prevent disease,  said Dr. Bauman, also an associate professor in Pitt s School of Medicine.

Under the terms of the agreement, Thermo Fisher will market and distribute Horizon s X-MAN human haploid and diploid isogenic cell line collection and will further offer Horizon s X-MAN haploid cell line generation service to its worldwide customer base. The X-MAN cell line range represents an extensive bank of genetically defined human cell lines   models that accurately exhibit disease-causing genetics, and have undergone a high degree of validation and quality control. These models help researchers to understand how complex genetic diseases manifest themselves, and can reduce the cost of bringing to market new personalized therapies by streamlining many aspects of drug development, including target identification, target validation, assay development, drug screening, lead optimization and biomarker-driven clinical trial design. The X-MAN catalogue includes both diploid (cells with two natural copies of each gene) cell lines and haploid (proprietary cells engineered to have only one copy of each gene) cell lines developed using Horizon s proprietary precision (rAAV) and high-throughput (HT-CRISPR) genome-editing technologies. Additionally, Horizon offers rapid and low cost on-demand generation of engineered haploid cell lines that for the first time bring these valuable research tools to the 72,000+ research labs studying the basic and applied function of genes and genetic variation. All of Horizon s X-MAN cell lines are provided as  isogenic pairs , meaning that each modified cell is provided with a matched control so that when experiments are performed, researchers can attribute differences in experimental results with confidence to the specific genomic modification, which is difficult to do using historical patient-derived cell lines.  Dr. Paul Morrill, President, Products, Horizon Discovery Group plc, commented:  This strategic agreement underscores the value of Horizon s X-MAN cell line collection and gene editing services, and, in particular, highlights the impact Horizon s haploid models are already having on the research community, following the acquisition of Haplogen Genomics GmbH in January 2015. Under this agreement, Thermo Fisher will market these products to researchers worldwide using its e-commerce and direct sales channels.   Thermo Fisher is committed to providing researchers around the world with the most advanced technologies designed to help them move scientific research forward,  said Lalit Dhir, vice president of Strategy, Portfolio & Business Development at Thermo Fisher Scientific.  Our agreement with Horizon Discovery Group is an example of that commitment to our research customers. ","Published: April 20, 2015"

Bacterial diversity in the Yanomami, previously unexposed to antibiotics or industrialized diets, was found to be nearly double that of people living in industrialized countries, and was also significantly higher than in other remote populations moderately exposed to modern practices. The team published its findings in the journal Science Advances. The results suggest that antibiotic usage or western diet are linked to the reduced bacterial diversity observed in modern societies, and that this loss of diversity happens quickly upon initial exposure to those practices.  There is a gradient of bacterial diversity that appears to be inversely correlated with exposure to modern practices, such as antibiotics, C-section, or processed foods,  said Jose C. Clemente, PhD, Assistant Professor of Genetics and Genomics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and first author of the study.  Even minimal exposure to these practices greatly decreases diversity and removes potentially beneficial bacteria from our microbiome.  To date, the vast majority of studies on the human microbiome the trillions of bacteria harbored in the body that are essential to our well-being have focused on Western populations.  Characterizing the bacterial communities of non-Western, unexposed populations is essential to understand how the microbiome changes and adapts to westernization,  said Dr. Clemente,  and how those changes might be driving the increased incidence of diseases linked to imbalances in the microbiome.  The Yanomami villagers of this study, who have subsisted as hunters-and-gatherers for hundreds of generations, are believed to have lived in total seclusion from Western civilization until 2009 when they were first contacted by a medical expedition. Among a rare population of people unexposed to modern antibiotics, the villagers offer a unique window onto the human microbiome.  We have found unprecedented diversity in fecal, skin, and oral samples collected from the Yanomami villagers,  said Maria Dominguez-Bello, PhD, Associate Professor of Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and the senior author of the study.  Our results bolster a growing body of data suggesting a link between, on the one hand, decreased bacterial diversity, industrialized diets, and modern antibiotics, and on the other, immunological and metabolic diseases such as obesity, asthma, allergies, and diabetes, which have dramatically increased since the 1970s,  said Dr. Dominguez-Bello. The analysis of gut and oral bacteria also revealed that the Yanomami villagers had bacteria encoding antibiotic resistance genes, despite their lack of previous exposure to antibiotics. Surprisingly, the bacterial genes conferred resistance not only to natural antibiotics, such as those produced by soil microbes, but also to synthetic antibiotics.  During the 1940s and 1950s, in the heyday of pharmaceutical antibiotic development, most antibiotics were derived from naturally occurring bacteria in the soil,  said co-author Gautam Dantas, PhD, Associate Professor of Pathology, Immunology, and Biomedical Engineering at Washington University School of Medicine.  So, we would expect that natural resistance to antibiotics would emerge over millions of years of evolution,  he said.  We didn t expect to find resistance to modern synthetic antibiotics.  The presence of resistance genes in microbiota unexposed to antibiotics may help explain the rapid rate at which bacteria develop resistance to new classes of antibiotics, noted Dr. Dantas.    The results from this study have given us a much better understanding of our microbial past,  said Dr. Clemente.  Characterizing now the functions encoded in those bacteria that we are missing will provide further insights into the mechanisms behind these immune and metabolic conditions, and potentially guide us in the development of new therapeutics.

Unlike the tiredness that we all experience sometimes, fatigue in those with MS can have a hugely negative impact -- it can limit or stop people from doing day-to-day activities and things that really matter to them. It is the main reason why people with MS stop working. Research undertaken at Bournemouth University (BU) has been tackling the challenge of managing fatigue in people with MS, with encouraging results. Dr Sarah Thomas, Professor Peter Thomas and colleagues from the BU Clinical Research Unit, along with collaborators from the Dorset MS Service at Poole Hospital, have developed a group-based fatigue management program for people with MS called FACETS (Fatigue: Applying Cognitive behavioural and Energy effectiveness Techniques to lifeStyle). This program combines providing people with tools and strategies to manage their energy levels more effectively and supporting them to explore different, more helpful ways of thinking about fatigue. The program is delivered via a series of weekly group sessions, facilitated by two health professionals who have experience of cognitive behavioral approaches and of working with people with MS. The sessions are highly structured and incorporate a combination of learning techniques, including presentations, group discussions, flipchart exercises and tasks to do at home. FACETS has been evaluated in an MS Society funded trial led by Professor Thomas with collaborators from Poole, Bristol, and Southampton. Participants were randomized into two groups; one of which attended the FACETS program in addition to usual care, and one of which continued with their routine care. The results showed that the FACETS group demonstrated improvements in fatigue severity and self-efficacy at a four-month follow-up. A year on from the beginning of the trial, improvements were still sustained and additional improvements in quality of life were even emerging. Given the progressive nature of MS, the debilitating nature of fatigue, and the lack of effective fatigue drug treatments that work for the majority, such findings are encouraging and important. People who attended the FACETS program gave feedback after each session and these ratings indicated high overall satisfaction: ""It was very helpful to me. I learned a lot and it has made my life so much easier. I would recommend it to anyone."" For the research team, one of the most rewarding aspects of carrying out their work has been seeing it rolled out in to practice and improving the quality of life for people with MS. The UK MS Society has developed the research into one-day training courses for health professionals, who are then able to apply their new knowledge to support people with MS in their local areas. Alison Nock and Vicky Slingsby, both occupational therapists, have been delivering the training. To date, over 150 health professionals have been trained across the UK, and the course has been very positively received. One attendee commented: ""The course was fantastic -- best training I have had in a very long time."" Not only has the research been of benefit to people with MS, it has also inspired a number of other research projects across Europe. A French research team based at the Universit  Paris Ouest Nanterre La D fense are looking to develop booster sessions for the FACETS program, which will be particularly useful given the unpredictable and progressive nature of MS. Other researchers in Norway and Germany are also undertaking work to adapt the FACETS program for different clinical settings and healthcare systems. Bournemouth University   press release Peter W.

Experiments in mice and human cells have shown that the protein promotes the proliferation of cytotoxic T cells, which kill cancer cells and cells infected with viruses. The discovery was unexpected because the new protein had no known function and doesn t resemble any other protein. Researchers from Imperial College London who led the study are now developing a gene therapy designed to boost the infection-fighting cells, and hope to begin human trials in three years. The study also involved researchers at Queen Mary University of London, ETH Zurich and Harvard Medical School. Their discovery, which has been six years in the making, is reported in the journal Science. Cytotoxic T cells are an important component of the immune system, but when faced with serious infections or advanced cancer, they are often unable to proliferate in large enough quantities to fight the disease. By screening mice with genetic mutations, the Imperial team discovered a strain of mice that produced 10 times as many cytotoxic T cells when infected with a virus compared with normal mice. These mice suppressed the infection more effectively, and were more resistant to cancer. They also produced more of a second type of T cells, memory cells, enabling them to recognize infections they have encountered previously and launch a rapid response. The mice with enhanced immunity produced high levels of a hitherto unknown protein, which the researchers named lymphocyte expansion molecule, or LEM. They went on to show that LEM modulates the proliferation of human T cells as well as in mice. The researchers now aim to develop a gene therapy designed to improve immunity by boosting the production of LEM. With the support of Imperial Innovations, the technology commercialization company for the College, the researchers have filed two patents. A company called ImmunarT has been formed with the aim of commercializing the technology. Professor Philip Ashton-Rickardt from the Section of Immunobiology in the Department of Medicine at Imperial, who led the study, said:  Cancer cells have ways to suppress T cell activity, helping them to escape the immune system. Genetically engineering T cells to augment their ability to fight cancer has been a goal for some time and techniques for modifying them already exist. By introducing an active version of the LEM gene into the T cells of cancer patients, we hope we can provide a robust treatment for patients.  Next we will test the therapy in mice, make sure it is safe and see if it can be combined with other therapies. If all goes well, we hope to be ready to carry out human trials in about three years.  The research was funded by the Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust and the British Heart Foundation. Dr Mike Turner, Head of Infection and Immunobiology at The Wellcome Trust, said:  The discovery of a protein that could boost the immune response to not only cancer, but also to viruses, is a fascinating one. Further investigation in animal models is needed before human trials can commence, but there is potential for a new type of treatment that capitalizes on the immune system s innate ability to detect and kill abnormal cells.

VTT used antibodies - produced by methods of molecular biology - as morphine sensing molecules when creating this printing technology-based morphine test. Using printing technology to manufacture rapid tests enables high production volumes and low production costs. A paper-based test enables a rapid analysis of whether a compound - in this case, morphine - is present in a given sample. Possible future applications of the developed test include drug testing at workplaces and in connection with traffic control. This method, developed by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd, provides several advantages, such as high production volumes, low material costs and disposability as well as design freedom based on bendability and foldability of paper. ""In 2010, we proved that the VTT method works in a hemoglobin assay. Through our continued development efforts, we wanted to confirm that the method also works in mass-production of more demanding tests. Morphine as a small-sized molecule places major requirements on the analytical performance of the test. In the future, the new method will also present an opportunity to simultaneously analyze other drugs of abuse and residues of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites from one and the same sample"", says Tomi Erho, Principal Scientist at VTT. Morphine and hemoglobin tests have shown that paper is an excellent platform for various antibody-based tests. In rapid testing, paper can replace nitrocellulose, which is typically used as a reaction and flow substrate, to provide a very low-cost, lightweight and biodegradable material alternative. In the future, paper could also become a competitive alternative for commonly used plastic-based assay platforms. Printing technology will be a low-cost method for the manufacture of rapid tests designed for the use of consumers, businesses and authorities for instance in the areas of health, welfare and the environment. Rapid diagnostics and the expansion of testing outside clinical and analytical laboratories to patients and other end-users is a rising trend. Printing of tests on paper will provide entirely new opportunities for innovations based on the mass production of home test kits. The research was performed at VTT as part of research projects mainly funded by Tekes - the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation.","Published: April 18, 2015"

Long term follow-up data out to at least 24 months in all patients treated in the PISCES study arebeing presented by the clinical team from Glasgow s Southern General Hospital on 19th April in aplatform presentation at the 2015 European Stroke Organization Conference (ESOC), taking place in Glasgow. The data are being presented ahead of submission for publication in a peer-reviewed clinical journal later this year. There have been no cell-related or immunological adverse events reported in any of the elevenpatients treated in the study (across the four ascending dose levels). Adverse events reported were related only to the implantation procedure or the patient s underlying medical condition. Improvements in neurological status and limb function compared to pre-treatment baselineperformance were observed within three months of treatment and maintained throughout long term follow-up. Improvements in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) were seen in all dose groups. The NIHSS is a measure used to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. For all subjects, the median baseline score was 7. This improved to 5 at 3 months and was sustained at 2 years follow up with a median score of 5 (p=0.002). Other measures of neuromuscular disability were supportive of the NIHSS improvement. MeanAshworth Scale scores, a measure of limb spasticity, were 18.1 and 9.7 (affected upper and lower limb, respectively) at baseline, which improved to 15.7 and 7.8 at 3 months and 16.1 and 6.5 at 2 years. Improvements in scores on the Barthel Index (a measure of activities of daily living) were also consistent with the neuromuscular score changes with a median value of 12 at baseline, 14 at 3 months and 14 at 2 years. The Company is currently conducting a UK multi-site Phase II clinical trial (PISCES II) to examine the efficacy of its CTX stem cell treatment in patients disabled by an ischaemic stroke. As a result of observed good safety profile of the treatment, the highest cell dose from the PISCES study is being used in the ongoing Phase II study. As with the PISCES study, the Phase II clinical trial involves a single, one-off injection of CTX cells into the brain. Subject to patient recruitment, initial data from this study are expected around the end of this year. Olav Helleb , Chief Executive Officer of ReNeuron, said:  We are delighted to report long term data from all of the stroke patients treated in the PISCES study at this year s ESOC meeting. The data confirm the good safety profile of our CTX stem cell treatment in this setting and it is particularly gratifying to see that the functional improvements previously observed in the patients against baseline measurements have been maintained in long term follow up. We look forward to reporting data from our ongoing Phase II study with CTX in disabled stroke patients in due course.  Professor Keith Muir, SINAPSE Professor of Clinical Imaging, Division of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Glasgow, and Principal Investigator of the PISCES study, said:  We continue to be both pleased and encouraged by the data from the PISCES study. The long term follow-up data continue to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of the CTX treatment. The evidence of functional improvement warrant further investigation and, in this regard, we are delighted to be a principal participating centre in the ongoing Phase II efficacy study with CTX.

They re also more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer at a younger age. Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis led an analysis of 24 studies involving more than 29,000 smokers of European ancestry and found that smokers with a particular variation in a nicotine receptor gene were more likely to continue smoking for four years after those without the variant had quit. Those with the genetic variant also were more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer four years earlier than those without the variation in the CHRNA5 gene. The findings may result in changes to efforts to screen patients for lung cancer. They are published April 14 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.  People with the risk variant average a four-year delay in the age at which they quit smoking,  said first author Li-Shiun Chen, MD.  Instead of quitting at age 52, which was the average age when study participants with a normal gene stopped smoking, people with the genetic variant quit at age 56.  Chen said those with the gene variant also tend to inhale more deeply when they smoke. That combination of genes and behavior contributes to the development of lung cancer earlier in life.  They are likely to be diagnosed four years earlier,  she said.  In those with lung cancer, the average smoker without the gene variant is diagnosed at age 65. Those with the greater genetic risk tend to be diagnosed at 61.  Chen said the presence of the gene variation has important clinical implications. Smokers who have the gene variant could undergo lung cancer screening at a younger age, she said. In addition, previous work from Chen and senior investigator Laura Jean Bierut, MD, shows that those with the gene variant are more likely to respond to medications that help people quit smoking, so knowing more about a smoker s genetic makeup could help guide that individual s therapy.  The same people with this high-risk gene are more likely to respond to smoking-cessation medications, such as nicotine-replacement patches, lozenges or gum,  Chen said.  Although it s clear the gene increases the chances a person will develop lung cancer at a younger age, it also is clear that the risk can be reversed with treatment.  Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, making up 13 percent of all cancer cases and leading to 27 percent of all cancer deaths. And survival rates are low. About half of all lung cancer patients die within a year of being diagnosed. Only about one in six are still alive five years after diagnosis.  So a diagnosis that comes four years earlier is very significant clinically,  Chen explained. Bierut, the Alumni Endowed Professor of Psychiatry at Washington University, said the clinical implications of the findings are enormous. Currently, people tend to be screened for lung cancer according to how much they smoke and how old they are. But the new research supports the idea of doctors using genetic information to target people who might not be screened otherwise, she explained.  Adding this information to screening criteria could help us focus our resources on people at the highest risk,  Bierut said.  In addition, knowing that they are the ones most likely to respond to nicotine-replacement therapy could allow us to respond with treatments that are more likely to be effective.  Chen and Bierut plan to expand their studies to include smokers from ethnic groups not represented in this analysis. They also want to look at other genes related to smoking, nicotine dependence and cancer risk, with the goal of creating a risk score that could be used to assess addiction and cancer risk in individual smokers.","Published: April 18, 2015"

Anxiety and the ability to predict an outcome Making decisions is a complex process that is made easier when the outcomes of actions are predictable. Researchers know that people with high anxiety are more likely to interpret unexpected variability as a sign of catastrophe. For example, a good student with low or average anxiety may receive a poor mark on an exam, and interpret this as a sign to study more or do better next time, while a good student with high anxiety might see this poor mark as a sign that they ll fail the entire course. It is thought that anxious individuals have difficulty updating their expectations when outcomes become more variable, and that this difficulty may stem from an impaired ability to use environmental cues to help them learn to avoid a bad outcome.

Overall, positive outcomes for patients increased from 35 per cent to 60 per cent. The clinical trial is known by the acronym SWIFT-PRIME. (Solitaire with the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment) randomized 196 patients to receive either t-PA, a clot busting drug or tPA plus ET. The study had 39 participating sites in the United States and Western Europe. ET is performed by inserting a thin tube into the artery in the groin, through the body, and into the brain vessels to the clot. This is done under image-guided care using an X-ray. The clot is then removed by a retrievable stent and pulled out, restoring blood flow to the brain. This is the second NEJM publication for Goyal this year. In February Goyal, along with HBI and Department of Clinical Neuroscience members Drs. Michael Hill and Andrew Demchuk, led an international stroke trial showing that ET for ischemic stroke victims dramatically improved outcome. The trial known as ESCAPE (Endovascular treatment for Small Core and Anterior circulation Proximal occlusion with Emphasis on minimizing CT to recanalization times), showed positive outcomes for patients increased from 30 per cent to 55 per cent. In many cases, instead of suffering major neurological disability, patients went home to resume their lives. The overall mortality rate was reduced from two in 10 patients for standard treatment of care to one in 10 patients - a 50 per cent reduction with ET. ESCAPE was led by the HBI along with the departments of clinical neurosciences and radiology at the Cumming School of Medicine. ESCAPE had 316 patients, at 22 sites in five countries. Eleven of these sites were in Canada. As a result of all four publications, policy makers are now in the process of rewriting international clinical care guidelines for stroke care.

Typically, for a condition such as epilepsy, it is essential to act at exactly the right time and place in the brain. For this reason, the team of researchers led by Christophe Bernard at Inserm Unit 1106, ""Institute of Systems Neuroscience"" (INS), with the help of scientists at the  cole des Mines de Saint- tienne and Link ping University (Sweden) have developed an organic electronic micropump which, when combined with an anticonvulsant drug, enables localized inhibition of epileptic seizure in brain tissue in vitro. This research is published in the journal Advanced Materials. Drugs constitute the most widely used approach for treating brain disorders. However, many promising drugs failed during clinical testing for several reasons: Epilepsy is a typical example of a condition for which many drugs could not be commercialized because of their harmful effects, when they might have been effective for treating patients resistant to conventional treatments. During an epileptic seizure, the nerve cells in a specific area of the brain are suddenly activated in an excessive manner. How can this phenomenon be controlled without affecting healthy brain regions? To answer this question, Christophe Bernard's team, in collaboration with a team led by George Malliaras at the Georges Charpak-Provence Campus of the  cole des Mines of Saint- tienne and Swedish scientists led by Magnus Berggren from Link ping University, have developed a biocompatible micropump that makes it possible to deliver therapeutic substances directly to the relevant areas of the brain. The micropump (20 times thinner than a hair) is composed of a membrane known as ""cation exchange,"" i.e., it has negative ions attached to its surface. It thus attracts small positively charged molecules, whether these are ions or drugs. When an electrical current is applied to it, the flow of electrons generated projects the molecules of interest toward the target area. To enable validation of this new technique, the researchers reproduced the hyperexcitability of epileptic neurons in mouse brains in vitro. They then injected GABA, a compound naturally produced in the brain and that inhibits neurons, into this hyperactive region using the micropump. The scientists then observed that the compound not only stopped this abnormal activity in the target region, but, most importantly, did not interfere with the functioning of the neighboring regions. This technology may thus resolve all the above-mentioned problems, by allowing very localized action, directly in the brain and without peripheral toxicity. ""By combining electrodes, such as those used to treat Parkinson's disease, with this micropump, it may be possible to use this technology to treat patients with epilepsy who are resistant to conventional treatments, and those for whom the side-effects are too great,"" explains Christophe Bernard, Inserm Research Director. Based on these initial results, the researchers are now working to move on to an in vivo animal model and the possibility of combining this high-technology system with the microchip they previously developed in 2013. The device could be embedded and autonomous. The chip would be used to detect the imminent occurrence of a seizure, in order to activate the pump to inject the drug at just the right moment. It may therefore be possible to control brain activity where and when it is needed. In addition to epilepsy, this state-of-the-art technology, combined with existing drugs, offers new opportunities for many brain diseases that remain difficult to treat at this time.

University at Albany atmospheric scientist James Schwab will examine the impact of wood smoke on air quality in the Adirondacks, where wood remains one of the chief sources of heat in rural communities. ""Wood smoke is a significant contributor to the overall particle pollution in large areas of upstate during the winter months,"" said Schwab, a senior research associate at the Atmospheric Sciences and Research Center (ASRC). ""Our project goal is to collaborate with the Department of Environmental Conservation to build portable and flexible measurement systems for responding to local air pollution concerns."" The research is supported by a $510,000 contract from the New York State Energy and Research Development Authority. Schwab is also partnering with Assistant Professor Eric Leibensperger of SUNY Plattsburgh and Associate Professor Huiting Mao of the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry on a proposal to the SUNY Research Foundation on Adirondack air quality and climate. Both studies will examine the effects of wintertime wood smoke on Adirondack air quality, using portable, low-cost sensors to measure community exposure to pollutants, especially ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Based on work being done elsewhere in the Northeast, there is already a clear connection between wood heating, air quality, and asthma. With wood burning remaining the primary source of heat for many people in the Adirondacks, and recorded data on climatic and atmospheric conditions dating back nearly 50 years, the region is an ideal location for examining the impact of wood smoke. Using a Global Forecast System to Examine Impact of Aerosols The air pollution projects are two of several at ASRC that is looking at the relation between air pollution and climate change. Research Associate Dr. Cheng-Hsuan Lu has received a grant for $140,125 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Prediction NCEP) to improve weather forecasting by taking into account the impact of aerosols on radiation and clouds. In addition to causing adverse health effects, aerosols impact cloud microphysics, reflectance and precipitation. Current global forecast systems are still inadequate to account for the impact of aerosols. Lu's work will enhance current software architecture and system engineering to enable NCEP's global forecast system to more closely monitor and determine the impact of aerosols in the atmosphere.","Published: April 17, 2015"

The findings, which will be published in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology, suggest that combining maple syrup extract with common antibiotics could increase the microbes  susceptibility, leading to lower antibiotic usage. Overuse of antibiotics fuels the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, which has become a major public-health concern worldwide. Prof. Nathalie Tufenkji s research team in McGill s Department of Chemical Engineering prepared a concentrated extract of maple syrup that consists mainly of phenolic compounds. Maple syrup, made by concentrating the sap from North American maple trees, is a rich source of phenolic compounds. The researchers tested the extract s effect in the laboratory on infection-causing strains of certain bacteria, including E. coli and Proteus mirabilis (a common cause of urinary tract infection). By itself, the extract was mildly effective in combating bacteria. But the maple syrup extract was particularly effective when applied in combination with antibiotics. The extract also acted synergistically with antibiotics in destroying resistant communities of bacteria known as biofilms, which are common in difficult-to-treat infections, such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections.  We would have to do in vivo tests, and eventually clinical trials, before we can say what the effect would be in humans,  Tufenkji says.  But the findings suggest a potentially simple and effective approach for reducing antibiotic usage. I could see maple syrup extract being incorporated eventually, for example, into the capsules of antibiotics.  The scientists also found that the extract affects the gene expression of the bacteria, by repressing a number of genes linked with antibiotic resistance and virulence. All maple syrup samples used in the study were purchased at local markets in Montreal, then frozen until the beginning of each experiment, which involved a series of steps to produce the phenolic-rich extract. Tufenkji, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Biocolloids and Surfaces, has also studied the potential for cranberry derivatives to fight infection-causing bacteria.

The researchers could identify that a feedback signalling mechanism is responsible for these changes. The innate neuronal property might be utilized to protect neurons from degeneration or cell death in the future. Changes in the functional connections between neurons -  synapses  - contribute to our ability to adapt to environmental changes. However until now, little was known about the signalling underlying such  synaptic plasticity . Now, investigations of fruit flies by researchers at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Tokyo Tech, the National Institute of Genetics in Japan, and the European Neuroscience Institute in Germany reveal details of the mechanisms behind synaptic plasticity. Recent studies have suggested that changes in a region at the presynaptic membrane, described as the active zone, control synapse function. The research teams based in Germany and Japan exposed living fruit flies - the commonly studied Drosophila - to different light regimes and then compared the active zones in the photoreceptors. T-shaped structures at the presynaptic membrane tether synaptic vesicles and control the release of neurotransmitters to the postsynaptic neuron. By tagging proteins that are crucial to these T-shaped structures the researchers revealed a drop in a subset of active zone proteins, while others remained unchanged. Further, they found that corresponding to the loss of structural proteins, the number of T-shaped structures was also reduced. The researchers were also able to identify that a feedback mechanism was responsible for these changes and that it relied on the signalling protein Wnt. The results contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying brain functions such as learning and memory. Future work may investigate how modifying the Wnt signal can be used to manipulate synaptic plasticity, with possible therapeutic applications for neurodegenerative or mental diseases.  This synaptic change might reflect an innate neuronal property that leads to protection from excessive stimuli,  explains Dr. Atsushi Sugie, the study's lead author.  By enhancing this property, we might be able to protect neurons from degeneration or cell death.  Background Synapses Synapses allow chemical signals to pass between neurons so that information can travel around the nervous system. Chemical signals are passed by the presynaptic release of neurotransmitters by synaptic vesicles. The neurotransmitters are received by postsynaptic receptors allowing the signal to pass from neuron to target neuron. Repetitive or prolonged stimuli can lead to short- or long-term changes at synapses, affecting how they transmit signals and supporting plastic changes in the function of the nervous system, including learning and memory or the ability to adapt to environmental changes. The role of proteins Previous studies have identified that the probability of neurotransmitter release is strongly correlated with the levels of certain proteins at the active zone region of the pre-synaptic membrane. In addition, the localization of these proteins depends on neural activity. The present study reveals that the molecular composition of synapses can be modulated in living organisms exposed to sustained environmental stimuli. Study details Sugie and colleagues maintained Drosophila fruit flies that had just entered the adult stage of their life cycle in one of three light regimes: constant light; constant dark; and 12 hours light with 12 hours dark. The light used was mild to avoid retinal degeneration. Observations of fluorescently-tagged active zone protein Bruchpilot showed that while this protein was initially localized at discrete points representing active zones, prolonged exposure to light caused delocalization, which was reversed when the flies were returned to darkness. A number of proteins have been associated with the structure of the active zone and the T-shaped structures that tether the synaptic vesicles. Although a subset of proteins was not affected, the researchers observed changes comparable to the loss of Bruchpilot in other proteins with similar functions, as well as re-organization of the microtubules. According to the researchers the study suggests an accessible paradigm for assessing synaptic plasticity in neuronal synapses, as opposed to neuro-muscular synapses. They also emphasize how in their work they monitor synaptic plasticity with an optical microscope by tagging proteins with fluorescent molecules without the need for an electron microscope.","Published: April 17, 2015"

More than one billion people worldwide suffer from high blood pressure and this contributes significantly to deaths from cardiovascular disease. It is hoped that advances in understanding the genetic basis of how blood pressure is regulated will improve the prediction of susceptibility to cardiovascular disease and also provide insight into how individually tailored treatments for high blood pressure can reduce the risk of disease. ""For more than 50 years the Framingham Heart Study has been an invaluable source of research findings on the contributions of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking and other factors to the development of cardiovascular disease,"" says Daniel Levy, director of the Framingham Heart Study. ""More recently we have launched a major initiative to identify and study the genes underlying cardiovascular and other chronic diseases in individuals taking part in the Framingham Heart Study since we believe that this research could lead to new treatments and better strategies for disease prevention."" Dissecting genetic data to identify molecular alterations that lead to or cause disease is very challenging. In the present work, the authors developed a strategy that combines multiple types of large-scale genetic and molecular data. Specifically, the scientists first looked at a vast collection of gene expression data from 3679 individuals who were not receiving any drug treatment for high blood pressure. As a starting point, they combined information on likely genetic differences contributing to elevated blood pressure by incorporating genome-wide association studies with the gene expression data for all of the individuals they studied. As a next step, the researchers worked from the hypothesis that it would be the surrounding network of certain disease-causing genes that would have the most impact on blood pressure and disease susceptibility. Scientists have known for some time that looking at each gene in isolation is not a powerful enough way to determine how different genes underlie blood pressure and other complex traits. By looking at multiple genes and how they interact, the researchers were able to find four groups of genes linked to blood pressure that warranted further study to reveal key driver genes controlling blood pressure regulation. ""Our work was able to pinpoint several gene networks closely linked to the regulation of blood pressure,"" says Tianxiao Huan, one of the lead authors of the study. ""As a proof-of-concept, we validated one of these key driver genes, Sh2b3, and demonstrated its relationship to hypertension in mice."" The researchers revealed that mice lacking the Sh2b3 gene had normal blood pressure but showed an exaggerated blood pressure response to treatment with angiotensin-II, a naturally occurring hormone that causes blood vessels to contract. Adding further confidence that Sh2b3 can play a causal role in the dysregulation of blood pressure in humans, the scientists found that the genes predicted to be affected by Sh2b3 greatly overlapped with the set of genes whose expression is indeed affected in the mice that lack the Sh2b3 gene. ""Moving forward, it should be possible to study additional key driver genes in this way, which should help in our efforts to identify novel targets for the prevention and treatment of hypertension,"" says Huan.","Published: April 17, 2015"

The discovery was unexpected because the new protein had no known function and doesn t resemble any other protein. Researchers from Imperial College London who led the study are now developing a gene therapy designed to boost the infection-fighting cells, and hope to begin human trials in three years. The study also involved researchers at Queen Mary University of London, ETH Zurich and Harvard Medical School. Their discovery, which has been six years in the making, is reported today in the journal Science. Cytotoxic T cells are an important component of the immune system, but when faced with serious infections or advanced cancer, they are often unable to proliferate in large enough quantities to fight the disease. By screening mice with genetic mutations, the Imperial team discovered a strain of mice that produced 10 times as many cytotoxic T cells when infected with a virus compared with normal mice. These mice suppressed the infection more effectively, and were more resistant to cancer. They also produced more of a second type of T cells, memory cells, enabling them to recognise infections they have encountered previously and launch a rapid response. The mice with enhanced immunity produced high levels of a hitherto unknown protein, which the researchers named lymphocyte expansion molecule, or LEM. They went on to show that LEM modulates the proliferation of human T cells as well as in mice. The researchers now aim to develop a gene therapy designed to improve immunity by boosting the production of LEM. With the support of Imperial Innovations, the technology commercialisation company for the College, the researchers have filed two patents. A company called ImmunarT has been formed with the aim of commercialising the technology. Professor Philip Ashton-Rickardt from the Section of Immunobiology in the Department of Medicine at Imperial, who led the study, said:  Cancer cells have ways to suppress T cell activity, helping them to escape the immune system. Genetically engineering T cells to augment their ability to fight cancer has been a goal for some time and techniques for modifying them already exist. By introducing an active version of the LEM gene into the T cells of cancer patients, we hope we can provide a robust treatment for patients.  Next we will test the therapy in mice, make sure it is safe and see if it can be combined with other therapies. If all goes well, we hope to be ready to carry out human trials in about three years.  Dr Claudio Mauro, who led the research from the Centre for Biochemical Pharmacology, based within Queen Mary University of London s William Harvey Research Institute, said:  This study has identified the novel protein LEM and unlocked an unexpected way of enhancing the ability of our immune system to fight viruses or cancers. This is based on the ability of the protein LEM to regulate specific energy circuits, and particularly mitochondrial respiration, in a subset of white blood cells known as cytotoxic T cells. This discovery has immediate consequences for the delivery of innovative therapeutic approaches to cancer. Its ramifications, however, are far greater as they can help explaining the biological mechanisms of widespread human diseases involving altered immune and inflammatory responses. These include chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.  The research was funded by the Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust and the British Heart Foundation. Dr Mike Turner, Head of Infection and Immunobiology at The Wellcome Trust, said:  The discovery of a protein that could boost the immune response to not only cancer, but also to viruses, is a fascinating one. Further investigation in animal models is needed before human trials can commence, but there is potential for a new type of treatment that capitalises on the immune system s innate ability to detect and kill abnormal cells.

The system offers cost-effective, minimal hands-on, ultra-high resolution sequence analysis that enables accurate detection of rare variants. It utilizes novel and patent pending Relay-PCR  and Omega-Primer  technologies. The company will collaborate with beta testers to generate test data sets, establish the limits of the technology by testing on difficult sample types and challenging design projects, and develop clinically relevant standard panels. NGS technologies have already had a tremendous impact on functional genomics research and their routine clinical use is imminent. Though whole genome sequencing is now possible, there remain instances where ultra-high resolution analysis is required, such as detecting rare disease causing variants, or ensuring the accuracy and reproducibility of a clinical test. Additionally, when only several, specific genes or genomic regions are of interest as in the case of precision medicine and where time, expenses, and data storage are limiting factors, targeted sequencing is a logical choice. Currently available targeted sequencing methods suffer from low uniformity, sequence drop out, complicated work flow, lengthy hands-on time, and/or high up-front equipment investment. The VariantPro system from LC Sciences is a simple and robust multiplexing PCR method that effectively overcomes all of these challenges. One innovation in the VariantPro system is Relay-PCR, in which one pair of common (indexed library) primers and multiple pairs of specific primers are mixed with a genomic DNA sample in a single tube. A single PCR run seamlessly combines two functionally separated reaction phases, namely target replication and library amplification. This results in a significantly simplified work flow. The new method brings a profound change to multiplexing PCR by limiting the role of specific primers to only the first two thermo cycles for target selection and enabling an automatic switch to common primers in the remaining thermo cycles for library amplification. This relay-switch to common primers eliminates a significant cause for amplicon to amplicon variations common to traditional multiplexing PCR due to priming efficiency variations among specific primers which are exponentially amplified when used as amplification primers. Another innovation in the VariantPro system is Omega-Primer which is composed of three functional sections: a 5p arm designed to ensure stable binding to a corresponding template, a 3p arm designed to double check sequence specificity and initiate polymerase extension, and a separation segment between the two arms. The use of two separate binding sections provides primer design freedoms that balance priming specificity and binding strength. Omega-Primers generally have much shorter 3p arms than that of regular primers and thus have a statistically much lower chance of forming amplifiable primer-primer dimmers in a multiplex PCR setting. Additionally, only the short 3p arms are incorporated into amplicon products, thus the sections of native templates in sequencing reads are maximized. LC Sciences has also developed new approaches for quantitative prediction of PCR performance and has incorporated these new approaches into a computer program for the multiplexing PCR primer designs. According to Chris Hebel, the company s VP of Business Development,  Unlike current multiplex PCR targeted sequencing methods that suffer from inherent sequence bias, complicated work-flows, and/or up-front equipment investment, VariantPro effectively balances uniformity, specificity, coverage, and multiplexing level in an elegantly simple one step reaction via Relay-PCR on a regular PCR machine, thus requiring less hands on work and less sequencing depth per sample.

Without treatment, commonly a combination of breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy, up to a half of patients will have their disease come back, either as DCIS or as invasive breast cancer. It is currently not possible to predict which cases will progress; so all women are offered radical treatment, potentially unnecessarily. A recent study by researchers from the Manchester Cancer Research Centre, published in the journal Annals of Oncology, has explored potential subtypes of DCIS and whether these subtypes relate to disease recurrence. Professor Nigel Bundred, from The University of Manchester and University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, who led the study, said:  We know that different subtypes of invasive breast cancer have different levels of disease recurrence. We wanted to investigate similar subtypes in DCIS to see if they had predictive power.  The team looked at tumour samples taken from 314 patients diagnosed with DCIS. By using a range of tissue stains, they were able to assess levels of oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 - human epidermal growth factor - in order to divide the samples into four subtypes. They found that patients whose tumours tested positive for ER and PR, but negative for HER2, were less likely to see their cancer come back. Other subtypes were significantly more likely to recur as invasive breast cancer.  We regularly measure ER levels in patients with DCIS, but our findings suggest that the additional information from testing for HER2, which is routine for patients with more advanced disease, could allow us to better identify those most at risk of invasive relapse. These tests are cheap and easy to carry out and could help some patients avoid unnecessary treatment,  added Professor Bundred.","Published: April 17, 2015"

The researchers examined families with a history of the disease. Because the disease has long been considered randomly occurring rather than inherited, people with a family history are not typically screened. Results were published recently in Gastroenterology.  Small intestinal carcinoid tumors usually grow slowly without symptoms. It is often too late to reverse the condition once people seek medical attention,  said lead author Stephen Wank, M.D., senior investigator at the NIH s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), which supported the trial.  Our findings suggest that people with a family history of the disease should be screened for it. We hope this research empowers thousands of at-risk people with a way to prevent these tumors from becoming a devastating disease.  Conducted at the NIH Clinical Center, the study screened 181 people from 33 families, each with at least two cases of small intestinal carcinoid. The researchers discovered the disease in 23 people who had not yet developed symptoms, and successfully removed all tumors in 21 of those people. Genetic linkage analysis revealed a target DNA region shared by all affected members of a particularly large family. Genome sequencing narrowed that finding to a gene defect passed from one generation to the next, suggesting that the gene is an inherited risk factor for the disease.  Studying entire families gave us a unique insight into the genetic factors that can increase risk of small intestinal carcinoid,  said Wank.  This innovative study embodies NIH s unmatched leadership in rare disease research,  said NIDDK Director Griffin P.

Michael Roberts, a Curators Professor of Animal Science and a professor of biochemistry, and his colleagues, says these new stem cells can help advance research on pre-eclampsia and a number of other areas of the human reproductive process.  These new cells, which we are calling bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) -primed stem cells, are much more robust and easily manipulated than standard embryonic stem cells,  said Roberts, a researcher in the MU Bond Life Sciences Center.  BMP-primed cells represent a transitional stage of development between embryonic stem cells and their ultimate developmental fate, whether that is placenta cells, or skin cells or brain cells. We can use these new stem cells for future research to better understand how embryos are organized and what causes diseases like pre-eclampsia and other prenatal problems.  Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent, meaning they can develop into a number of different types of cells such as muscle cells, bone cells, skin cells, etc. For their study, Roberts and his colleagues were attempting to grow placenta cells from embryonic stem cells by adding a substance called BMP-4 for a shorter period of time than had been done previously. They also added two other drugs that temporarily inhibited key biochemical pathways associated with the pluripotent state of the stem cells. Instead of forming placenta cells, the stem cells grew into what was a previously unobserved state, referred to by the MU scientists as  BMP primed  stem cells. They found these cells to be much easier to work with in a laboratory setting than traditional stem cells because they are easier to grow and are more uniform, meaning that all the cells in the culture are quite similar to each other in the way they express their genetic information.  Previously, the common thought was that embryonic stem cells transitioned straight from stem cells to their end products,  Roberts said.  These new stem cells made us realize that embryonic stem cells exist in a number of different transitional states, which likely resemble those encountered in the early stages of embryos. This should open the door for future stem cell research that is much more efficient. We now have new stem cells that are easier to manipulate since they are already at the key transitional precipice before changing into placenta cells, skin cells or any other kind of cell that makes up the human body.

This first-in-human Phase I trial, conducted at the University Hospitals of Mainz and Tuebingen, Germany, is designed to evaluate the safety and long-term tolerability of ISTH0036 in patients with advanced glaucoma undergoing filtration surgery (trabeculectomy) due to uncontrollable elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). The trial will enroll approximately 24 - 30 patients, who will be treated with escalating doses of ISTH0036. In addition to safety, patients will be monitored for intraocular pressure and visual field preservation.  Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world, and ISTH0036 with its expected three-directional activity, which includes blocking TGF- 2-mediated trabecular meshwork alteration, and inhibiting both direct optic nerve toxicity and scarring post trabeculectomy, has the potential to substantially alter the course of this disease and protect the patient s vision,  commented Prof. Eugen Leo, Isarna s Head of Clinical Development. He added:  Notably, ISTH0036 is currently the sole compound in clinical development worldwide that directly targets the core driver of the pathophysiology of glaucoma: TGF- 2.  Prof. Sir Peng Khaw, Professor of Glaucoma and Ocular Healing, University College London/Moorfields Eye Hospital and clinical advisor to Isarna stated:  This novel oligonucleotide selectively targeting TGF- 2, an important driver of glaucoma, seems to possess impressive PK-PD properties that could make it a valuable treatment for different aspects of glaucoma. I am very much looking forward to the clinical exploration of this compound.  TGF-  plays an important role in key pathways such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, immune response and tissue modeling. Significantly elevated levels of TGF-  have been identified in glaucomatous eyes in the anterior chamber, the vitreous, and optic nerve head. TGF-  has been shown to directly cause increased intraocular pressure, a critical risk factor in the progression of glaucoma through complex interaction with the trabecular meshwork, leading to decreased aqueous humor outflow and has been linked to direct optic nerve toxicity. Dr. Philippe Calais, CEO of Isarna Therapeutics, concluded:  The start of our first Phase I trial in advanced glaucoma is a major corporate milestone, one that we have achieved two years after starting this program thanks to an outstanding and expedited preclinical program. We are excited to move this and other compounds forward to successfully treat glaucoma and other major ophthalmic diseases. ","Published: April 17, 2015"

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/paternal-sperm-may-hold-clues-to-autism-204832,Paternal Sperm May Hold Clues to Autism Tags on DNA from fathers  sperm linked to children s autism symptoms  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In a small study, Johns Hopkins researchers found that DNA from the sperm of men whose children had early signs of autism shows distinct patterns of regulatory tags that could contribute to the condition. A detailed report of their findings will be published online in the International Journal of Epidemiology on April 15. Autism spectrum disorder (autism) affects one in 68 children in the U.S. Although studies have identified some culprit genes, most cases remain unexplained. But most experts agree that autism is usually inherited, since the condition tends to run in families. In this study, investigators looked for possible causes for the condition not in genes themselves, but in the  epigenetic tags  that help regulate genes  activity.  We wondered if we could learn what happens before someone gets autism,  says Andrew Feinberg, M.D., M.P.H., the King Fahd Professor of Molecular Medicine and director of the Center for Epigenetics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  If epigenetic changes are being passed from fathers to their children, we should be able to detect them in sperm,  adds co-lead investigator Daniele Fallin, Ph.D., professor and chair of the Department of Mental Health in the Bloomberg School of Public Health and director of the Wendy Klag Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities. In addition to being easier to sample than egg cells from women, sperm are more susceptible to environmental influences that could alter the epigenetic tags on their DNA. Feinberg, Fallin and their team assessed the epigenetic tags on DNA from sperm from 44 dads. The men were part of an ongoing study to assess the factors that influence a child early on, before he or she is diagnosed with autism. The study enrolls pregnant mothers who already have a child with autism and collects information and biological samples from these mothers, the new baby s father and the babies themselves after birth. Early in the pregnancy, a sperm sample was collected from fathers enrolled in the study. One year after the child was born, he or she was assessed for early signs of autism using the Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI). The researchers collected DNA from each sperm sample and looked for epigenetic tags at 450,000 different positions throughout the genome. They then compared the likelihood of a tag being in a particular site with the AOSI scores of each child. They found 193 different sites where the presence or absence of a tag was statistically related to the AOSI scores. When they looked at which genes were near the identified sites, they found that many of them were close to genes involved in developmental processes, especially neural development. Of particular interest was that four of the 10 sites most strongly linked to the AOSI scores were located near genes linked to Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetic disorder that shares some behavioral symptoms with autism. Several of the altered epigenetic patterns were also found in the brains of individuals with autism, giving credence to the idea that they might be related to autism. The team plans to confirm its results in a study of more families and to look at the occupations and environmental exposures of the dads involved. There is currently no genetic or epigenetic test available to assess autism risk.","Published: April 17, 2015"

Researchers report in the journal ACS Macro Letters that injecting a certain type of nanoparticle helped reduce lung damage in rats experiencing such trauma. The potential treatment, which could be given at the most critical moment immediately after a blast, could save lives. Pamela J. VandeVord, Erin B. Lavik and colleagues explain that in today s conflict zones, explosions account for 79 percent of combat-related injuries. Internal bleeding in the lungs resulting from these blasts can lead to death. Soldiers with such injuries need medical attention within a few hours, but options for immediate treatment are lacking. VandeVord s team set out to fill this therapeutic void. Building on past research in this area, the researchers paired clot-promoting nanoparticles with a corticosteroid that stops inflammation. They injected the particles in rats within 10 minutes of traumatic injury and found the therapeutic compound increased oxygen levels, and reduced internal bleeding and cellular damage in the lungs.

Industry has responded with a slew of options, including preservatives from kimchi, a popular Korean staple made out of fermented cabbage and radish. But scientists are now reporting in ACS  Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry that at least one commercial, kimchi-based preservative marketed as  all-natural  contains synthetic ingredients. John C. Vederas and colleagues note that the bacteria responsible for kimchi fermentation do produce some compounds that could block the growth of unwanted microbes in cosmetics. Taking advantage of this antimicrobial trait, some cosmetics companies have replaced synthetically produced preservatives with kimchi fermentation products. They claim that these products can combat a wide variety of microorganisms, including yeasts and molds. But recent research has shown that peptides from kimchi are only active against a limited set of bacteria, and cosmetics require broader protection. So Vederas  team wanted to take a closer look at kimchi-derived commercial products. The researchers found that certain commercial samples of kimchi fermentation products did block the growth of a wide variety of microbes. But when they tested the contents of the preservative, they discovered that it contained compounds that were most likely produced synthetically. Their analysis also showed that it was these additives that were responsible for the antimicrobial activity of the product, not the kimchi.","Published: April 17, 2015"

Aphasia affects about 1 in 250 people, making it more common than Parkinson's Disease or cerebral palsy, and can make it difficult to return to work and to maintain social relationships. A new study published in the journal Nature Communications provides a detailed brain map of language impairments in aphasia following stroke. ""By studying language in people with aphasia, we can try to accomplish two goals at once: we can improve our clinical understanding of aphasia and get new insights into how language is organized in the mind and brain,"" said Daniel Mirman, PhD, an assistant professor in Drexel University's College of Arts and Sciences who was lead author of the study. The study is part of a larger multi-site research project funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health and led by senior author Myrna Schwartz, PhD of the Moss Rehabilitation Research Institute. The researchers examined data from 99 people who had persistent language impairments after a left-hemisphere stroke. In the first part of the study, the researchers collected 17 measures of cognitive and language performance and used a statistical technique to find the common elements that underlie performance on multiple measures. They found that spoken language impairments vary along four dimensions or factors: Next, the researchers determined how individual performance differences for each of these factors were associated with the locations in the brain damaged by stroke. This procedure created a four-factor lesion-symptom map of hotspots the language-specialized left hemisphere where damage from a stroke tended to cause deficits for each specific type of language impairment. One key area was the left Sylvian fissure: speech production and speech recognition were organized as a kind of two-lane, two-way highway around the Sylvian fissure. Damage above the Sylvian fissure, in the parietal and frontal lobes, tended to cause speech production deficits; damage below the Sylvian fissure, in the temporal lobe, tended to cause speech recognition deficits. These results provide new evidence that the cortex around the Sylvian fissure houses separable neural specializations for speech recognition and production. Semantic errors were most strongly associated with lesions in the left anterior temporal lobe, a location consistent with previous research findings from these researchers and several other research groups. This finding also made an important comparison point for its opposite factor -- semantic recognition, which many researchers have argued critically depends on the anterior temporal lobes. Instead, Mirman and colleagues found that semantic recognition deficits were associated with damage to an area they call a ""white matter bottleneck"" -- a region of convergence between multiple tracts of white matter that connect brain regions required for knowing the meanings of words, objects, actions and events. ""Semantic memory almost certainly involves a widely distributed neural system because meaning involves so many different kinds of information,"" said Mirman. ""We think the white matter bottleneck looks important because it is a point of convergence among multiple pathways in the brain, making this area a vulnerable spot where a small amount of damage can have large functional consequences for semantic processing."" In a follow-up article soon to be published in the journal Neuropsychologia, Mirman, Schwartz and their colleagues also confirmed these findings with a re-analysis using a new and more sophisticated statistical technique for lesion-symptom mapping. These studies provide a new perspective on diagnosing different kinds of aphasia, which can have a big impact on how clinicians think about the condition and how they approach developing treatment strategies. The research team at the Moss Rehabilitation Research Institute works closely with its clinical affiliate, the MossRehab Aphasia Center, to develop and test approaches to aphasia rehabilitation that meet the individualized, long-term goals of the patients and are informed by scientific evidence. According to Schwartz, ""A major challenge facing speech-language therapists is the wide diversity of symptoms that one sees in stroke aphasia. With this study, we took a major step towards explaining the symptom diversity in relation to a few primary underlying processes and their mosaic-like representation in the brain. These can serve as targets for new diagnostic assessments and treatment interventions."" Studying the association between patterns of brain injury and cognitive deficits is a classic approach, with roots in 19th century neurology, at the dawn of cognitive neuroscience. Mirman, Schwartz and their colleagues have scaled up this approach, both in terms of the number of participants and the number of performance measures, and combined it with 21st century brain imaging and statistical techniques. A single study may not be able to fully reveal a system as complex as language and brain, but the more we learn, the closer we get to translating basic cognitive neuroscience into effective rehabilitation strategies.

Instead, they discovered that the findings were limited to a single patient and could not be applied to further clinical work. This discovery, published April 15 in Nature, amends the earlier work and underscores the importance of independent study validation and careful assay development. The earlier   and now dispelled   study, published in Nature in June 2012 by researchers at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, found a gene fusion in a small but significant number of tumor samples from patients with triple negative breast cancer, a particularly deadly subtype that often has few treatment options. The original research team concluded that MAGI3-AKT3 fusion could offer a new molecular target to use for drug development. Soon after this study was published, a Weill Cornell team led by Drs. Mark A. Rubin, Sandra J. Shin and Juan Miguel Mosquera, set out to determine if and how often the gene fusion occurred in Weill Cornell's own collection of triple negative breast cancer samples. ""Large genomic studies are reporting reams of new mutation data, and some are short on validation,"" said study co-senior author Dr. Rubin, director of the Institute for Precision Medicine at Weill Cornell and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. They developed a tissue-based assay test that could reveal samples positive for MAGI3-AKT3 fusion, an approach that is typically used in developing biomarkers, an area in which the Weill Cornell team is expert. They were surprised that none of the Weill Cornell samples were positive for this mutation. ""The finding of MAGI3-AKT3 fusion by respected researchers and published in a top journal offered great hope and a sense of excitement about developing a new therapeutic target for triple negative breast cancer,"" said Dr. Shin, the co-senior author of the study, who is also the chief of breast pathology and an associate professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College. ""We clarified that the initially reported mutation was not recurrent and with the exception of one case, was an artifact,"" said Dr. Mosquera, an assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and pathology leader of the Institute for Precision Medicine. ""Our work highlights that pathology is essential for verification in this type of scenario. The initial finding has to be amended and our study acknowledged."" To fully correct the MAGI3-AKT3 fusion finding, the Weill Cornell team went through a lengthy process that started with screening 150-plus in-house samples. They expected to find that about 7 percent of them contained the gene fusion, as was the case in the original Nature paper, but instead found zero matches. They noticed that the original tumors studied in 2012   save the index case   were never verified to have this alteration at the genomic level. Instead, the initial team of researchers had used a screening test on RNA and based on these findings, made the assumption that additional tumors also had the mutation. The Weill Cornell team further tested more than 100 additional samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and University Hospital Zurich. They were also unable to confirm the original finding in these cases. They communicated their results to Nature and to the Broad Institute investigators almost two years ago, leading those researchers to reanalyze their 72 patient samples, plus an additional 370 breast tumors. When they went back and re-tested the samples at the DNA level, they found the gene fusion only in the first case that triggered this longer study, making it an isolated finding that cannot be applied to develop future clinical trials. The Weill Cornell team agrees that the MAGI3-AKT3 fusion finding should have been validated at the genomic level before those results were ever published. ""Our study demonstrates the important process of biomarker development and addresses an important point in precision medicine,"" said Dr. Rubin, who is also the Homer T. Hirst III Professor of Oncology in Pathology at Weill Cornell. ""It is gratifying to know that our results have saved many investigators time, effort and resources toward a goal that was ultimately not achievable,"" Dr. Shin said. ""Just as importantly, patients have been spared from participating in a clinical trial that could not have led to a positive result."" ","Published: April 16, 2015"

The researchers examined families with a history of the disease. Because the disease has long been considered randomly occurring rather than inherited, people with a family history are not typically screened. Results were published recently in Gastroenterology.  Small intestinal carcinoid tumors usually grow slowly without symptoms. It is often too late to reverse the condition once people seek medical attention,  said lead author Stephen Wank, M.D., senior investigator at the NIH s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), which supported the trial.  Our findings suggest that people with a family history of the disease should be screened for it. We hope this research empowers thousands of at-risk people with a way to prevent these tumors from becoming a devastating disease.  Conducted at the NIH Clinical Center, the study screened 181 people from 33 families, each with at least two cases of small intestinal carcinoid. The researchers discovered the disease in 23 people who had not yet developed symptoms, and successfully removed all tumors in 21 of those people. Genetic linkage analysis revealed a target DNA region shared by all affected members of a particularly large family. Genome sequencing narrowed that finding to a gene defect passed from one generation to the next, suggesting that the gene is an inherited risk factor for the disease.  Studying entire families gave us a unique insight into the genetic factors that can increase risk of small intestinal carcinoid,  said Wank.  This innovative study embodies NIH s unmatched leadership in rare disease research,  said NIDDK Director Griffin P. Rodgers, M.D.  Our new understanding of small intestinal carcinoid tumors gives scientists and health care providers a stronger platform to continue to develop proactive approaches in treatment, diagnosis and prevention.  About 30,000 Americans have small intestinal carcinoid tumors. Like most cancers, early treatment greatly increases survival rates and quality of life. ","Published: April 16, 2015"

The method described in a recent paper may soon help manufacturers and regulators better assess and compare the performance and quality of mAbs. The IBBR is a joint institute of NIST and the University of Maryland. Monoclonal antibodies can be used as extremely specific therapeutic agents, including ones designed to target cancer cells unique to an individual. However, in order to properly function as a biotherapeutic agent, the molecule s structural units amino acids must fold into a three-dimensional structure that aligns its active regions with corresponding receptor sites on a target cell or antigen. If misfolding occurs, a potent and safe treatment may become ineffective, or worse, provoke a dangerous or fatal immune reaction. High-resolution spectral analysis imaging at the atomic level where even the bonds between hydrogen and carbon atoms are distinguishable is required to precisely define the mAb s structure and determine if the protein is folding properly.   We refer to this as  measuring fingerprints,  because just as a person has a unique set of fingerprint patterns, each mAb has a one-of-a-kind spectral makeup,  says NIST research chemist Robert Brinson.  If we can map that spectral fingerprint, we can determine whether or not folding is occurring as desired.  To do this, the IBBR team turned to a solution that would surprise most biopharmaceutical experts: two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D NMR) spectroscopy. NMR is a technique that measures the atomic signature of a molecule similar to how doctors use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to noninvasively view organs.  To date, it s been assumed that 2D NMR could not be practically applied to monoclonal antibodies because it s too insensitive, too time intensive and too expensive for analyzing anything other than much smaller drug molecules,  Brinson explains. In pushing the boundaries of the technique, the IBBR team used an NMR system with a high magnetic field strength to produce the first 2D NMR map of a complete, drug-like mAb. The map was generated using signals from methyl groups.  Methyl groups are dispersed throughout the mAb structure and, in particular, in the folded cores of the molecule that we want to evaluate,  Brinson says.  We can use their signals to yield a specific spectral fingerprint that reflects the unique structure of the mAb.  To make the 2D NMR method more accessible to the lower-strength magnetic field instruments found in most analytical research labs, the IBBR team narrowed the analysis by dividing its sample antibody into two structural fragments. We mapped the 2D NMR signals generated by the subset of methyl groups found in these fragments, both about a third of the size of the entire protein,  Brinson says.  The sum of the data gained from this analysis was found to be a good proxy for the spectral fingerprint of the full mAb.  The new 2D NMR fingerprinting method also overcomes the problems of cost and time.  We reduced the time needed for our measurements from many hours to about 30 minutes,  Brinson says. Brinson says that he and his colleagues are now working on a statistical method that will allow users of their 2D NMR methodology to compare fingerprints from multiple protein samples.  With that ability, manufacturers will be able to quantitatively show that spectra obtained from different lots of the same drug product are identical, enabling them to better meet regulatory requirements for quality and performance,  he says.","Published: April 16, 2015"

The investigators at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center say their analysis of more than 800 cancer patients  sequencing data, which was generated by Personal Genome Diagnostics Inc., a company co-founded by the researchers, shows that without such comparisons, attempts to individualize cancer therapy may be inappropriate in certain cases, and patients may get the wrong targeted therapies. A report on the work appears in the April 16 issue of Science Translational Medicine.  Increasingly, hospitals and companies are beginning to sequence patients  tumors in an attempt to personalize therapy. However, many are not sequencing each person s normal tissue to filter out noncancer-related changes and to really understand what is occurring in the tumor,  says Victor Velculescu, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of oncology and pathology and co-director of the Cancer Biology Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Velculescu explains that personalized therapies increasingly designed to target the unique genetic changes that drive a person s tumor depend on accurate assessment of a tumor genome, but not all genetic changes in a cancer are directly related to the cancer. Some, he explains, are so-called germline changes, which are inherited changes in genes that are in normal tissues and differ from person to person.  We all carry variations in our germline genome. They re part of what makes us individually unique,  says Valsamo Anagnostou, M.D., Ph.D., a clinical fellow at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and co-author of the study. Only by comparing the genetic sequence of an individual s tumor and his or her own normal cells can clinicians know which changes are more likely to be cancer-related and which treatments are likely to work. Treatment decisions based on faulty genetic information might affect  any patient whose genome is being sequenced right now and could amount to thousands of patients in the near future  as genetic testing of tumors becomes more common, Anagnostou says. Inaccurate genetic information can lead to serious side effects from inappropriate therapies, lack of useful targeted therapies and increased costs of patient care from misguided medicines. For the study, Velculescu and his colleagues compared the genomes of tumor and normal tissue from 815 patients who had a variety of cancers, including breast, brain, renal, gastric, lung, pancreatic, blood cancers and melanoma.  When the researchers only looked at the genetic changes found in a patient s tumor and filtered out the most well-known germline changes, they counted 382 possible tumor-related changes. But after comparing a patient s full germline genome to his or her tumor genomes, they determined that, on average, 249 of these changes were part of the patient s normal, inherited genetic variation and were not tumor-specific.  In other words, Velculescu says, 65 percent of the genetic changes identified with tumor-only genetic sequencing were  false positives  and not related to the patient s cancer. The researchers also looked at changes in  actionable genes,  or genes for which some kind of drug or cancer therapy has already been identified. When they looked for these changes in the tumor alone, they identified on average 2.4 changes per patient. However, they found that 33 percent of those changes were also false positives when they compared the tumor genome to the patient s germline genome. These false positives affected 48 percent of the patients analyzed.  In tumor-only analyses, we found that nearly half of patients had tumor mutations that were actually germline or false positives in actionable genes, and they could lead to inappropriate therapy,  Velculescu says. Velculescu and his team acknowledge there may be challenges in implementing tumor-normal analyses in a clinical setting.  These include the additional work and costs of sequencing and analyzing a patient s normal tissue along with his or her tumor tissue but Velculescu says some efficiencies could be realized by using the patient s saliva, blood or normal tissue recovered during a biopsy or tumor removal. Costs for tumor gene sequencing begin at several thousand dollars, which would increase if sequencing was done on DNA from normal tissue as well. Velculescu also notes that health insurance may not fully cover normal-tissue genetic sequencing. Addressing concerns about patient privacy when normal genomes are sequenced, Velculescu says that comparisons of tumor and normal sequences can be designed to use germline changes as a filter without identifying what those germline changes are and what their potential health implications might be. In addition to selecting personalized therapies for patients with cancer, sequencing the normal tissue genome can also increase the overall understanding of cancer, including finding cancer predisposition due to germline genome changes, says Velculescu. In this study, the germline analyses identified changes in cancer-related genes in 3 percent of the patients who had no known signs of genetically linked cancer.  These analyses can help us find alterations in cancer-predisposing genes in ways that weren t previously appreciated,  he suggests.

The findings from the University of Chicago and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology could bolster efforts to develop the next generation of anti-viral treatments. Viruses can mutate rapidly in order to adapt to environmental pressure. This feature also helps them become resistant to anti-viral drugs. But scientists have developed therapeutic anti-viral agents for HIV, hepatitis C and influenza using a strategy called lethal mutagenesis. This strategy seeks to extinguish viruses by forcing their already high mutation rates above an intolerable threshold. If viruses experience too many mutations, they can t properly manage their genetic material.  They can t replicate and so are quickly eliminated,  said Andrei Tokmakoff, the Henry G. Gale Distinguished Service Professor in Chemistry at UChicago.  In order to make this work, you need a stealth mutagen. You need something sneaky, something that the virus isn t going to recognize as a problem.  Tokmakoff and his associates at UChicago and MIT reported new details of the stealthy workings of the anti-HIV agent KP1212 in March in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Supporting data were collected with two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, an advanced laser technique that combines ultrafast time resolution with high sensitivity to chemical structure. CRITICAL TOOLS  Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy will be critical on the path ahead. It lets us look at the structures that exist in aqueous solution, which is the natural milieu of cells,  said study co-author John Essigmann, MIT s William and Betsy Leitch Professor of Chemistry, Toxicology and Biological Engineering. Essigmann is co-founder of a pharmaceutical company that is developing mutagenic inhibitors of HIV.  We also have done nuclear magnetic resonance, which is very informative, but those studies were done in organic solvents that probably do not as accurately provide a view of what happens in cells as did the infrared studies done by the Tokmakoff group,  Essigmann said. Scientists design lethally mutagenic molecules such as KP1212 to resemble natural DNA bases, the adenine-thymine, cytosine-guanine base pairs.  These analogs can bind to the wrong base partners and therefore lead to genetic mutations,  said the study s lead author, Sam Peng, who was a visiting graduate research assistant at UChicago. KP1212 is a cytosine variation, which normally would pair with guanine during replication. But biochemical experiments and clinical trials have shown that KP1212 induces mutations by pairing with adenine. A leading proposal suggested that KP1212 derived its mutagenicity by shape shifting converting into a different molecular structure by repositioning its hydrogen atoms on nitrogen and oxygen atoms. Scientists call this shape-shifted structure a tautomer. James Watson, SB 47, and Francis Crick proposed this tautomer hypothesis in 1953 when they announced the discovery of DNA s double-helical structure.  The shuffled hydrogen positions in rare tautomers alter the hydrogen bonding patterns, resulting in incorrect base paring,  said Peng, who completed his doctorate at MIT in 2014 and will become a postdoctoral scientist at Stanford University later this year. RAPID MEASUREMENT Most experimental tools would have difficulty distinguishing between the normal and shape-shifted structures because they interconvert very rapidly. With two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, the UChicago team was able to distinguish between the two structures. The team also was able to measure how rapidly the shape shifting occurs under physiological conditions: in 20 billionths of a second. The research team expected to find only two dominant tautomers, but their experiments showed that many more exist. In addition to taking on different forms as a neutral molecule, KP1212 also could accept an extra proton, giving it a positive charge at physiological levels of acidity pH of approximately five and a half to seven that made possible even more rearrangements and tautomer structures.  The number of possibilities exploded,  Tokmakoff said. The experiments also showed that both the protonated and non-protonated forms facilitated the viral mutation rate. Even in the absence of the protonated form, the virus still mutated, just at a lower rate.  We found that under physiological pHs, KP1212 is significantly protonated and this protonated form induces even higher mutation rates, reaching approximately 50 percent,  Peng said. The finding that the molecule could become protonated both surprised and delighted Essigmann. The work taught his team how to create even more potent shape shifters by decorating the KP1212 scaffold with groups of atoms and molecules that further raises their ability to capture protons.  KP1212 is about 20 percent of the way toward being an ideal therapeutic mutagen. The hints given to us by the spectroscopy guide us toward even better mutagenic molecules,  Essigmann said. Although Essigmann and Tokmakoff have known each other for years, they pursued seemingly far-removed research specialties until now. Tokmakoff s biological research involves proteins, not DNA. But together their research teams were able to fruitfully undertake one of the first two-dimensional infrared spectroscopic studies of the therapeutic mechanism of an anti-viral drug.  This is how basic research works,  Tokmakoff said.  This is how so often you get transitions from basic research to real applications. They can t be predicted. ","Published: April 16, 2015"

Using a genetic engineering technique that causes adult skin cells to transform into  pluripotent  cells, otherwise known as induced pluripotent stem cells, which can take the form of many different cells found in other parts of the body,  we make brain cells out of the patient s own skin,  says Jeffrey Rothstein, M.D., Ph.D., who directs the Brain Science Institute and the Robert Packard Center for ALS Research.  While the technique for creating these human-made cells has been used by other researchers, Rothstein and his colleagues are the first to use these induced pluripotent stem cells to create the largest library of brain cell lines donated voluntarily by more than 20 ALS patients whose disease was caused by various genetic mutations.  These human cellular tools will serve as a platform to understand ALS and someday discover new drugs to treat our patients,  says Rothstein, senior author of a study about the work, which was recently published online in PLOS ONE.  More than 30,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with ALS. Men appear to be affected slightly more than women. One of every 500 deaths in men is due to ALS, says Rothstein,  so just about everyone is going to know a neighbor, friend or family member who will eventually succumb to this terrible disease.  There is no known cure for ALS and only one FDA-approved drug, riluzole, which may only add a year to a patient s life span, says Rothstein. Since the 1990s, researchers have studied the disease and its potential treatments in mice. The mouse model looks very much like what happens in people, Rothstein says,  but after 25 years, it has not led to the development of a drug that works in our patients.  A handful of drugs were effective in mice and passed phase II clinical trials, which establish a drug s safe dosage for humans, but they all failed phase III trials, which confirm a drug s effectiveness in people.  There has to be a sea change in how we approach ALS,  Rothstein says. Because there is no ethical or simple way to obtain brain tissue from living ALS patients, Rothstein and colleagues turned to induced pluripotent stem cell production. The technique gives researchers a tool to look at diseased human brain cells, including specialized nerve cells called astroglia, which play a critical role in ALS progression. Rothstein and his team created 22 patient-specific cell lines that included some  common mutations known to be associated with ALS and deposited them in a cell library, to be shared with other scientists. The library includes cells from patients with inherited ALS, which accounts for about 10 percent of ALS cases. Rothstein and his team also have generated cells from patients with the noninherited form of the disease   sporadic ALS, which makes up 90 to 95 percent of ALS cases. From one patient, the researchers collected a genetic variant found in both inherited and sporadic forms of the disease, and they added that variant to the library. Many scientists around the world have already used the library, and Rothstein hopes it will grow, with researchers making deposits of their own patients  cell lines. Eventually, induced pluripotent stem cells may be used to model diseases other than ALS and to test potential drug treatments, says Rothstein, who adds:  Now we have a real model for what s wrong with my patients.  Ying Li, Devon Cohen, Ping-Wu Zhang, Elizabeth Mosmiller, Nicholas Maragakis and Rita Sattler of Johns Hopkins contributed to the research. The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, Johns Hopkins, Emerald Foundation, ALS Association and the U.S. Department of Defense. Overall, the development of the library was initiated through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009). The cell lines are freely available to all researchers via the public warehouse maintained by the Coriell Institute.","Published: April 16, 2015"

""MammaPrint is the only breast cancer recurrence assay recommended in the AGO guidelines that is supported by peer-reviewed, prospective five-year outcome data to determine which patients are at low risk of breast cancer recurrence and can therefore safely forego chemotherapy.  At the St. Gallen conference, Agendia sponsored an evening symposia presented by Fatima Cardoso, MD, PhD that highlighted the MINDACT Trial and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration s (FDA) recent decision to grant MammaPrint its sixth FDA 510(k) clearance. The most recent clearance is for use in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. MammaPrint provides an unambiguous binary Low Risk or High Risk recurrence result. It is part of Agendia s suite of breast cancer assays that also includes the BluePrint  80-gene molecular subtyping assay and TargetPrint , a gene-expression assay. BluePrint provides additional therapy-predictive information, identifying the functional molecular subtype of breast cancer and the associated tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy. Like MammaPrint and TargetPrint, BluePrint is performed on FFPE. It is the most widely available test that uncovers the functional molecular subtype of a woman s breast cancer.  Agendia s suite of breast cancer recurrence assays fundamentally changes the conversation at the critical point where treatment decisions are being made,  said Egberts.  While MammaPrint test results eliminate the ambiguity of the intermediate result seen in up to 39% of other tests, functional molecular subtyping by BluePrint provides greater insight into the tumor biology that just isn t available from most of the other breast cancer recurrence assays on the market.

DLX105 is a PENTRA Body targeting TNF  for the treatment of inflammatory skin and autoimmune disorders. In a double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase 2 study involving 24 healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of three dose levels of i.v. DLX105 were studied. A high volume of distribution was observed indicating effective and fast tissue distribution making it a promising candidate to treat patients with flaring inflammatory diseases. A total of 6 patients with flaring Beh et s disease were subsequently enrolled in an open-label study. Each patient received a single dose of 10 mg/kg DLX105 i.v.. Rapid resolution of cutaneous and mucosal eruptions typical for flaring Beh et s disease was observed. Within a week post injection of DLX105 signs and symptoms of the preceding flare had almost completely disappeared confirming the rapid and efficient therapeutic activity of a single injection of DLX105 in those inflamed lesions. The clinical response was evident up to 4 weeks post treatment.  The fast and almost complete resolution of erythemata nodosa following a single infusion of DLX105 in one of our patients was particularly remarkable. The patient suffered from those difficult-to-treat skin nodules for already 5 years and all previous systemic therapies were ineffective,  said Theodoros Xenitidis, MD, University of T bingen and investigator in this study. Also Ina K tter, MD, investigator from Hamburg, confirmed substantial improvement of clinical symptoms of her treated patients.  As the applied single dose of DLX105 showed clinical activity up to 4 weeks, we have good evidence to believe that high biological activity associated with excellent tissue penetration into the inflamed lesions makes a difference to these patients. In addition, treatment was well tolerated,  commented Thomas Jung, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Delenex.  The data add substantial evidence to our proof-of-concept demonstrating the value of small and highly potent PENTRA Bodies for inflamed skin and autoimmune disorders,  adds Thomas Hecht, MD, Executive Chairman of Delenex.","Published: April 16, 2015"

They are the critical components for consequential investigations such as human and veterinary diagnostics, pathogen and microbe detection, environmental screening, epidemiological surveillance, and agricultural selection. Tim Robinson, CEO LGC said:  We are delighted to join our teams, science and expertise together. Through its facilities in Petaluma and Novato (USA), Aarhus (Denmark) and Steinach (Germany), Biosearch is a significant global supplier of custom oligonucleotides as well as reagents for their synthesis. Both LGC and Biosearch have a complementary range of products thus allowing us to provide customers with a one-stop shop for a wide range of genomics applications. We will continue to supply all Biosearch products as well as investing in its development and facilities. Biosearch employs a hugely talented workforce, with a long term and solid reputation for high quality service and delivery to its customers; we look forward to welcoming them to LGC. With this acquisition, we are strengthening our position within the applied genomics market, especially the agricultural biotechnology sector, and broadening our offering to the molecular diagnostics market. Integrating Biosearch s industry leading products, its unmatched expertise within the qPCR, molecular diagnostics markets and its world class manufacturing capabilities with LGC s operations will provide many opportunities to expand our genomics business globally.  Ron Cook, President of Biosearch said:  Over the past two decades, Biosearch has developed formidable technology know how and IP related to the manufacture and application of sophisticated oligonucleotides. During that time, Biosearch has built a market leading position for the supply of high value oligo components to the molecular diagnostics industry. As a result, our products and IP (such as Black Hole Quenchers) can be found in the most advanced molecular diagnostic assays on the market. But Biosearch s ability to address the needs of the international markets for oligonucleotides has been slowed by its relative small size and corporate infrastructure. To solve this problem, we are pleased that LGC has acquired Biosearch, and will make Biosearch operations the headquarters for its Genomics US operations. LGC s markets in forensics, agricultural biotechnology, and other applied gene testing applications fit perfectly with Biosearch s prodigious manufacturing capabilities. The collective synergies of the companies should result in rapidly expanding growth of the combined entities.  The acquisition will enable LGC s enlarged Genomics division to deliver a unique and compelling product and laboratory services offering for core qPCR and end point PCR applications such as SNP discovery, allelic discrimination and gene expression studies as well as for next generation sequencing. The two organizations have highly complementary product offerings and the combined portfolio will include DNA synthesis reagents, pre-designed assays for genotyping and pathogen detection, custom probes for qPCR, DNA polymerases and KASP  mastermixes for PCR, as well as instrumentation for high throughput DNA extraction and PCR.

The trial is supported by the National Institutes of Health s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Known as the Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV, or REPRIEVE, the randomized clinical trial is the largest to date focused on HIV-related cardiovascular disease. Researchers hypothesize that statins should reduce plaque development and improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HIV. The ultimate objective of the trial is to inform the best clinical approach to preventing cardiovascular disease in people infected with HIV. Research suggests that people with HIV are up to twice as likely as people without HIV infection to have heart attacks and other forms of cardiovascular disease, even after controlling for traditional risk factors such as elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, and smoking. However, there are no evidence-based therapies to lower the increased cardiovascular disease risk in people who have HIV. Statins are a class of drugs that have been previously demonstrated to be safe and effective in lowering cholesterol levels as well as the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in non-HIV populations. Study investigators plan to examine gender differences, among other factors, in the effects of statins once the data have been collected. Because HIV-infected men and women are now living much longer lives due to successful antiretroviral therapy, it is increasingly important to help them prevent cardiovascular disease to improve both their quality of life and their longevity. Thirty years ago, a 20-year-old diagnosed with HIV had only months to live, but today, a newly diagnosed 20-year-old who promptly starts antiretroviral therapy can expect to live another 50 years.  I am delighted that NHLBI and NIAID have joined forces to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration between cardiovascular and HIV researchers so that we can improve the lives of millions of people world-wide living with HIV and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease,  said NHLBI Director Gary H. Gibbons, M.D. A number of factors combine to put people with HIV at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. First, HIV causes inflammation that results in activated immune cells, both of which contribute to plaque buildup in the arteries (also known as atherosclerosis). This in turn leads to cardiovascular disease. Second, a well-documented consequence of antiretroviral therapy is higher cholesterol levels, which may contribute to cardiovascular disease risk. And third, the rates of some conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as smoking, are also higher in the HIV-infected population.  Research suggests that cholesterol-lowering statins may inhibit immune cell activation and inflammation and shrink arterial plaque,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  Therefore, these medications provide an intriguing possibility for improving cardiovascular outcomes in people with HIV.  Investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School (Steven Grinspoon, M.D. and Udo Hoffmann, M.D., M.P.H.), Harvard School of Public Health (Heather Ribaudo, M.D.) and Duke University (Pamela Douglas, M.D.) will conduct the trial in collaboration with the NIH-funded AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG). Roughly 100 sites in Canada, Puerto Rico, Thailand and the United States will participate. Investigators plan to randomize 6,500 HIV-infected participants, between the ages of 40 to 75 years, who would not meet current national guidelines for statin therapy to either a daily dose of pitavastatin, which is a statin, or a placebo while continuing with antiretroviral therapy. Pitavastatin was selected for this trial because, unlike most other statins, only minimal interactions occur between pitavastatin and drugs for treating HIV. Investigators will follow the participants for up to six years, assessing them for the development of major adverse cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes. The researchers will also evaluate the safety of statin therapy as well as other known effects of statins on cholesterol levels, immunologic parameters, and serious non-cardiovascular disease events, such as new-onset diabetes. Additionally, investigators will conduct a sub-study involving 800 participants to examine the effects of pitavastatin on coronary artery disease and inflammatory biomarkers in HIV-infected individuals. Although REPRIEVE is focused on people living with HIV, the study will provide general insights on the role of inflammation in the development of atherosclerosis and thus may provide knowledge that may benefit all patients with cardiovascular disease. REPRIEVE is primarily funded by the NHLBI. The study will be conducted in partnership with NIAID, which supports the ACTG. Kowa Pharmaceuticals America Inc., is donating the study drug and placebo and providing a monetary donation for the study. Researchers will conduct the study at a number of domestic and international sites, including most ACTG sites in the United States.","Published: April 16, 2015"

Dr Cinzia Casiraghi is a Reader in Graphene and Carbon Nanostructures, in the School of Chemistry, at the University of Manchester, UK. She runs a research group, the Casiraghi Group, which uses Raman spectroscopy to derive quantitative information on the properties and structure of carbon nanostructures. Examples include measuring the diameter of carbon nanotubes, the width of graphene nanoribbons and the amount, and type, of defects in graphene. The Group also studies the fundamentals involved in the Raman scattering process of carbon nanomaterials. Although the Raman spectrum of graphite has been known since the 1970s, the Raman scattering process in sp2-bonded carbon nanostructures is still not completely understood. The group is engaged in activities which range from the production of graphene (and other 2D materials) to the fabrication of flexible devices made of graphene inks. Here, Raman is used as an important tool to characterize the material and possible changes introduced during the fabrication of devices. Her group works closely with the National Graphene Institute (NGI), a new  61M facility at the University of Manchester. Commenting on her use of a Renishaw inVia confocal Raman microscope system, Dr Casiraghi says, ""inVia is a user-friendly and sensitive Raman spectrometer which can be equipped with both mapping and multi-wavelength capabilities. Both are very useful in the study of graphene and other carbon nanostructures. Mapping allows us to collect the Raman signal from a particular area of the sample, while multi-wavelength Raman spectroscopy enables us to study if, and how, the Raman spectrum changes when the material is excited at different energies. This is very important for graphene and sp2-bonded carbon nanostructures because there are certain peaks that change in position when the excitation energy is changed. This behaviour is correlated to the properties of the material. We recently purchased a Renishaw inVia system for the new National Graphene Institute (NGI). The instrument is equipped with several lasers lines, ranging from visible to near-UV (325 nm), and has a Raman mapping capability. It is very easy to change the wavelength. The UV capability is also very attractive, as the 325 nm line can be easily added to the visible lines, so it does not require buying two separate instruments. The instrument will be used for metrology studies and to set standards for graphene, in collaboration with the National Physical Laboratory (NPL)."" Continuing to describe her work, Dr Casiraghi said that the Casiraghi Group recently used the new Renishaw inVia to demonstrate the use of Raman spectroscopy as a non-destructive and rapid technique for probing the van der Waals forces between two atomically thin crystals (K-G Zhou et al, ACS Nano, 2014, 8 (10), pp 9914-9924). By performing Raman mapping on several types of heterostructures, they showed that information on the quality of the interface can be derived by looking at the changes in positions of the Raman peaks of the transition metal dichalcogenide crystal.","Published: April 16, 2015"

PLoS One published the results, which knock another chip off theories that Stone Age hand axes are simple tools that don't involve higher-order executive function of the brain. ""For the first time, we've showed a relationship between the degree of prefrontal brain activity, the ability to make technological judgments, and success in actually making stone tools,"" says Dietrich Stout, an experimental archeologist at Emory University and the leader of the study. ""The findings are relevant to ongoing debates about the origins of modern human cognition, and the role of technological and social complexity in brain evolution across species."" The skill of making a prehistoric hand axe is ""more complicated and nuanced than many people realize,"" Stout says. ""It's not just a bunch of ape-men banging rocks together. We should have respect for Stone Age tool makers."" The study's co-authors include Bruce Bradley of the University of Exeter in England, Thierry Chaminade of Aix-Marseille University in France; and Erin Hecht and Nada Khreisheh of Emory University. Stone tools - shaped by striking a stone ""core"" with a piece of bone, antler, or another stone - provide some of the most abundant evidence of human behavioral change over time. Simple Oldowan stone flakes are the earliest known tools, dating back 2.6 million years. The Late Acheulean hand axe goes back 500,000 years. While it's relatively easy to learn to make an Oldowan flake, the Acheulean hand axe is harder to master, due to its lens-shaped core tapering down to symmetrical edges. ""We wanted to tease apart and compare what parts of the brain were most actively involved in these stone tool technologies, particularly the role of motor control versus strategic thinking,"" Stout says. The researchers recruited six subjects, all archeology students at Exeter University, to train in making stone tools, a skill known as ""knapping."" The subjects' skills were evaluated before and after they trained and practiced. For Oldowan evaluations, subjects detached five flakes from a flint core. For Acheulean evaluations, they produced a tool from a standardized porcelain core. At the beginning, middle and end of the 18-month experiment, subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans of their brains while they watched videos. The videos showed rotating stone cores marked with colored cues: A red dot indicated an intended point of impact, and a white area showed the flake predicted to result from the impact. The subjects were asked the following questions: ""If the core were struck in the place indicated, is what you see a correct prediction of the flake that would result?"" ""Is the indicated place to hit the core a correct one given the objective of the technology?"" The subjects responded by pushing a ""yes"" or ""no"" button. Answering the first question, how a rock will break if you hit it in a certain place, relies more on reflexive, perceptual and motor-control processes, associated with posterior portions of the brain. Stout compares it to the modern-day rote reflex of a practiced golf swing or driving a car. The second question - is it a good idea to hit the core in a certain spot if you want to make a hand axe - involves strategic thinking, such as planning the route for a road trip. ""You have to think about information that you have stored in your brain, bring it online, and then make a decision about each step of the trip,"" Stout says. This so-called executive control function of the brain, associated with activity in the prefrontal cortex, allows you to project what's going to happen in the future and use that projection to guide your action. ""It's kind of like mental time travel, or using a computer simulation,"" Stout explains. ""It's considered a high level, human cognitive capacity."" The researchers mapped the skill level of the subjects onto the data from their brain scans and their responses to the questions. Greater skill at making tools correlated with greater accuracy on the video quiz for predicting the correct strategy for making a hand axe, which was itself correlated with greater activity in the prefrontal cortex. ""These data suggest that making an Acheulean hand axe is not simply a rote, auto pilot activity of the brain,"" Stout says. ""It requires you to engage in some complicated thinking."" Most of the hand axes produced by the modern hands and minds of the study subjects would not have cut it in the Stone Age. ""They weren't up to the high standards of 500,000 years ago,"" Stout says. A previous study by the researchers showed that learning to make stone tools creates structural changes in fiber tracts of the brain connecting the parietal and frontal lobes, and that these brain changes correlated with increases in performance. ""Something is happening to strengthen this connection,"" Stout says. ""This adds to evidence of the importance of these brain systems for stone tool making, and also shows how tool making may have shaped the brain evolutionarily."" Stout recently launched a major, three-year archeology experiment that will build on these studies and others. Known as the Language of Technology project, the experiment involves 20 subjects who will each devote 100 hours to learning the art of making a Stone Age hand axe, and also undergo a series of MRI scans. The project aims to hone in whether the brain systems involved in putting together a sequence of words to make a meaningful sentence in spoken language overlap with systems involved in putting together a series of physical actions to reach a meaningful goal.

In a study appearing today (April 15) in The Journal of Neuroscience, UCI neurobiologists report that dietary deficiencies in the type of fatty acids found in fish and other foods can limit brain growth during fetal development and early in life. The findings suggest that women maintain a balanced diet rich in these fatty acids for themselves during pregnancy and for their babies after birth. Susana Cohen-Cory, professor of neurobiology & behavior, and colleagues identified for the first time how deficits in what are known as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids cause molecular changes in the developing brain that result in constrained growth of neurons and the synapses that connect them. These fatty acids are precursors of docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, which plays a key role in the healthy creation of the central nervous system. In their study, which used female frogs and tadpoles, the UCI researchers were able to see how DHA-deficient brain tissue fostered poorly developed neurons and limited numbers of synapses, the vital conduits that allow neurons to communicate with each other.  Additionally, when we changed the diets of DHA-deficient mothers to include a proper level of this dietary fatty acid, neuronal and synaptic growth flourished and returned to normal in the following generation of tadpoles,  Cohen-Cory said. DHA is essential for the development of a fetus s eyes and brain, especially during the last three months of pregnancy. It makes up 10 to 15 percent of the total lipid amount of the cerebral cortex. DHA is also concentrated in the light-sensitive cells at the back of the eyes, where it accounts for as much as 50 percent of the total lipid amount of each retina. Dietary DHA is mainly found in animal products: fish, eggs and meat. Oily fish   mackerel, herring, salmon, trout and sardines   are the richest dietary source, containing 10 to 100 times more DHA than nonmarine foods such as nuts, seeds, whole grains and dark green, leafy vegetables. DHA is also found naturally in breast milk. Possibly because of this, the fatty acid is used as a supplement for premature babies and as an ingredient in baby formula during the first four months of life to promote better mental development. The UCI team utilized Xenopus laevis (the African clawed frog) as a model for this study because it allowed them to follow the progression and impact of the maternal dietary deficit in the offspring. Because frog embryos develop outside the mother and are translucent, the researchers could see dynamic changes in neurons and their synaptic connections in the intact, live embryos, where development can be easily studied from the time of fertilization to well after functional neural circuits form. They focused on the visual system because it s an accessible and well-established system known to depend on fatty acids for proper growth and utility.

But a study published three years after the operation found that the then-49-year-old could see colors, motion and some simple two-dimensional shapes, but was incapable of more complex visual processing. Hoping May might eventually regain those visual skills, University of Washington (UW) researchers and colleagues retested him a decade later. But in a paper now available online in Psychological Science, they report that May -- referred to in the study as M.M. -- continues to perform significantly worse than sighted control group participants. The conclusion: May's vision remains very limited 15 years after the surgeries. Though disappointing, the results provide valuable information that can help researchers better understand how vision develops and which visual processing tasks are most vulnerable to sight deprivation. ""With sight-restoration procedures becoming more developed, we're going to see more and more cases where people are blind for long periods of time and then get their sight back,"" said senior author Ione Fine, a UW associate professor of psychology. ""But we know very little about what happens in their brains during that period. That is going to be one of the fundamental questions going forward -- what happens when the lights are turned off, and what happens when you turn them back on?"" May went blind at age 3 when a jar of chemicals exploded in his face. He went on to work for the CIA and became a successful entrepreneur, founding the Sendero Group, a company that makes GPS and talking-map products for blind people. May is also a motivational speaker and holds the world downhill skiing speed record, 65 mph, for a completely blind person. But fully restored sight has eluded May, and his unusual case has puzzled researchers. There were few previous cases of restored vision before his -- the last well-documented one was in 1963 -- and scientists knew little about whether people whose sight is restored as adults can regain functional vision, and if so, how long that might take. In the recent tests, May was shown images of household objects and faces, and also video clips while his brain responses were measured with fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). As with the tests a decade earlier, May did not have normal brain responses to three-dimensional objects or faces, consistent with his inability to make sense of these stimuli. Researchers believe that's because May's brain, like those of other people who went blind at an early age, has adjusted to respond to other stimuli, such as sound or touch. ""We suspect that Mike lost vision at an age when these brain regions were able to take on new roles,"" said joint first author Jason Webster. ""It remains to be seen what these areas are doing now."" May's case is particularly interesting, Fine said, because his blindness started when the visual system is already developed, but the ability to perceive objects and faces is still evolving. ""He lost his vision at an age when vision is pretty good, but he was still young enough for it to deteriorate,"" she said. The findings, the researchers say, indicate that visual function for tasks such as object recognition and face processing continues to develop through childhood and early adolescence and remains sensitive to loss of sight for several years afterward. The good news, said joint first author and UW graduate student Elizabeth Huber, is that the findings imply that adults' vision is relatively fixed, meaning that as visual losses increase in an aging population, the chances of restoring useful sight to older people are good. ""This study is encouraging because it suggests that if someone loses sight later in life, it may still be possible to restore relatively normal vision, even after many years of blindness,"" she said. May told the researchers he uses his other senses to compensate for his poor vision. ""I have learned what works with vision and what doesn't, so I really don't challenge my vision much anymore,"" he said in the paper. ""Where motion or colors might be clues, I use my vision. Where details might be required, like reading print or recognizing who someone is, I use tactile and auditory techniques."" University of Washington   Original reporting by: Deborah Bach E.

A detailed report of the findings are published online in the International Journal of Epidemiology. Autism spectrum disorder affects one in 68 children in the U.S. Although studies have identified some culprit genes, most cases remain unexplained. But most experts agree that autism is usually inherited, since the condition tends to run in families. In this study, investigators looked for possible causes for the condition not in genes themselves, but in the ""epigenetic tags"" that help regulate genes' activity. ""We wondered if we could learn what happens before someone gets autism,"" says Andrew Feinberg, M.D., M.P.H., the King Fahd Professor of Molecular Medicine and director of the Center for Epigenetics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""If epigenetic changes are being passed from fathers to their children, we should be able to detect them in sperm,"" adds co-lead investigator Daniele Fallin, Ph.D., professor and chair of the Department of Mental Health in the Bloomberg School of Public Health and director of the Wendy Klag Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities. In addition to being easier to sample than egg cells from women, sperm are more susceptible to environmental influences that could alter the epigenetic tags on their DNA. Feinberg, Fallin and their team assessed the epigenetic tags on DNA from the sperm of 44 dads. The men were part of an ongoing study to assess the factors that influence a child early on, before he or she is diagnosed with autism. The study enrolls pregnant mothers who already have a child with autism and collects information and biological samples from these mothers, the new baby's father and the babies themselves after birth. Early in the pregnancy, a sperm sample was collected from fathers enrolled in the study. One year after the child was born, he or she was assessed for early signs of autism using the Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI). The researchers collected DNA from each sperm sample and looked for epigenetic tags at 450,000 different positions throughout the genome. They then compared the likelihood of a tag being in a particular site with the AOSI scores of each child. They found 193 different sites where the presence or absence of a tag was statistically related to the AOSI scores. When they looked at which genes were near the identified sites, they found that many of them were close to genes involved in developmental processes, especially neural development. Of particular interest was that four of the 10 sites most strongly linked to the AOSI scores were located near genes linked to Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetic disorder that shares some behavioral symptoms with autism. Several of the altered epigenetic patterns were also found in the brains of individuals with autism, giving credence to the idea that they might be related to autism. The team plans to confirm its results in a study of more families and to look at the occupations and environmental exposures of the dads involved. There is currently no genetic or epigenetic test available to assess autism risk. Johns Hopkins Medicine   press release Jason I. Feinberg, Kelly M. Bakulski, Andrew E.

These findings could provide valuable insight into the development of drug candidates that could protect brain cells in Parkinson s and other neurodegenerative diseases. The study, published recently online ahead of print by the journal Molecular and Cellular Biology, focuses on the enzyme known as serum glucocorticoid kinase 1 (SGK1).  The overexpression of SGK1 provides neuron protection in both cell culture and in animal models,  said Philip LoGrasso, a TSRI professor who led the study.  It decreases reactive oxygen species generation and alleviates mitochondrial dysfunction.  Using a neurotoxin animal model of neurodegeneration, the study showed that SGK1 protects brain cells by blocking several pathways involved in neurodegeneration, deactivating other molecules known as JNK, GSK3  and MKK4. Increasing SGK1 offers a potential therapeutic strategy because, as the study makes clear, there isn t enough naturally occurring SGK1 to do the job.    Even though the levels of naturally occurring SGK1 increases in the cell under stress, it was not enough to promote cell survival in our neurodegeneration model,  said Sarah Iqbal, the first author of the study and a member of the LoGrasso lab.  On the other hand, cell survival mechanisms tend to dominate when more SGK1 is added to the neurons.  The LoGrasso lab plans to continue to explore SGK1 as a therapeutic possibility for Parkinson s disease. The Scripps Research Institute   press release Sarah Iqbal, Shannon Howard, Philip V.

The CMP in Cyprus is a bi-communal body established in 1981 by agreement between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities under the auspices of the United Nations, to determine the fate of persons reported missing due to inter-communal conflict. To date, the CMP has identified more than 570 individuals. Bode Cellmark began issuing DNA kinship match reports to the CMP in November 2014. Bode Cellmark (formerly The Bode Technology Group, Inc), is delivering forensic genetic laboratory services, which includes DNA analysis, to the CMP as part of the process to identify individuals who went missing following conflicts in Cyprus in 1963, 1964 and 1974. Bode Cellmark has significant experience in identifying missing persons, and has implemented advanced sampling techniques and DNA extraction methods that optimize extraction of DNA profiles from degraded and aged bone samples. In this project, DNA profiles from skeletal samples will be compared to profiles obtained from family members to identify the missing persons.

The researchers analyzed hospital billing records, patient demographics, exposure information, and outcomes for Illinois hospital visits related to poisonings in 2010. They also looked at poisoning incidence data from four prominent national health surveys: the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, the National Health Interview Survey, the National Hospital Discharge Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. They found that charges for hospital visits in 2010 in Illinois approached $8 billion, representing 425,491 cases, with alcohol and illicit drugs accounting for the majority of visits. About half of patients were seen as outpatients in emergency rooms. The most common exposures were alcohol, drug dependence/abuse, cannabis and hallucinogens, opioid analgesics, cocaine and barbiturates, and benzodiazepine. Deaths were rare: for outpatients and inpatients, the mortality rate was 0.78 percent and 1.82 percent, respectively. Incidents of intentional self-harm were also rare, representing 1.3 percent of outpatient and 1.8 percent of inpatient cases. Comparing the Illinois hospital data to the results of national health surveys, the researchers found that the surveys missed a significant number of poisoning cases.  Definitions for poisoning used by these surveys often exclude exposure to alcohol, illicit drugs, and adverse effects from prescribed drugs,  says Lee Friedman, associate professor of environmental and occupational health sciences in the UIC School of Public Health, and co-author of the study.  The actual burden related to poisoning to hospitals and society is actually much higher than previously thought.  Friedman said analysis of hospital billing records in other states would likely reflect the same.  It s important to reintegrate alcohol and therapeutic drug reactions into the definition of poisoning in order to get a more accurate picture of the magnitude and burden of poisoning,  Friedman said. Substance abuse was the most common type of poisoning and accounted for slightly over half of hospital charges related to poisonings at approximately $4 billion. Alcohol exposures were identified in 44.4 percent of outpatient cases and 31.3 percent of inpatient cases. Adverse effects from therapeutic agents accounted for 32 percent of poisoning cases. The average length of stay for patients admitted to Illinois hospitals for poisonings, the majority due to alcohol, was 5.5 days.  That s a very long hospital stay,  Friedman said. Costs for inpatient stays totaled more than $7 billion. Friedman says these costs justify a public education campaign.  We have done a very good job from a public health standpoint on addressing smoking and communicating the negative health effects associate with tobacco,  Friedman said.  We need to do something similar with alcohol abuse, because it s clear from the results of our study that we are underestimating the number of people who abuse alcohol   the suffering associated with it is astronomical.  Friedman said warning labels similar to those on cigarette packaging should be used to communicate alcohol s risks, which include cancer, heart disease, liver disease and psychiatric disorders. Based on billing records, poisoning affected approximately 3 percent of all Illinoisans in 2010, said Alison Krajewski, a graduate student in the UIC School of Public Health and lead author study.  But she says the actual number of cases is probably even higher.  Many instances of poisoning or possible poisonings result in calls to poison control center hotlines, where trained toxicologists can differentiate for callers between cases severe enough to require attention at a hospital and those that can be safely treated at home,  Krajewski said.  Not every patient that makes a trip to the emergency room for poisoning needs to be there.  Expanding the resources allocated to poison control centers could have a real impact on reducing hospital visits and costs associated with poisonings,  she said.","Published: April 15, 2015"

The 10,000th cold hit is related to a case involving a sexual assault in Northern Virginia in August 2014. The investigation is still underway.   DNA Data Banks have become a 21st century crime-fighting tool, and the Virginia Department of Forensic Science has been at the forefront in using it to keep our citizens safe,  said Governor McAuliffe.  The 10,000 data bank hits reported by the Department have provided invaluable leads to law enforcement officers investigating unsolved crimes. The data bank has also assisted in exonerating the wrongfully-convicted thanks to hits identifying the actual perpetrators. My administration is committed to maximizing the benefit of this important resource.  Governor McAuliffe made the announcement during a tour of the state s Central Laboratory with U.S. Senator Mark Warner, D-Va.  Senator Warner said he is committed to ensuring that the federal government remains a strong and reliable funding partner for states as they expand and improve their forensic evidence programs.   I have always been proud to champion Virginia s DNA testing program,  said Senator Warner, who as Governor in 2002 announced the 1,000th  cold hit  from a DNA crime scene.  Because of the Commonwealth s robust commitment to this important program, Virginia has long led the nation in the use of cutting-edge DNA technology to protect the innocent and punish the guilty. As Senator, I promise to keep fighting to make sure that law enforcement has the federal support and resources it needs to bring offenders to justice. This is a matter of public safety.  Virginia s DNA data bank contains approximately 431,000 samples, and hits occur on a daily basis.  In April 2014, Governor McAuliffe signed legislation requiring state and local law enforcement agencies to conduct an inventory of all physical evidence recovery kits, or  PERK  kits, in their custody that contain biological evidence that has been collected but not submitted to the laboratory for analysis.   To date, DFS has received PERK inventories from 87 percent of the more than 380 law enforcement agencies in Virginia reporting more than 2,000 untested kits. A report on the results of the inventory will be submitted to the General Assembly by DFS by July 1, 2015.  This year, Governor McAuliffe successfully passed legislation (HB1928 and SB1187) that adds certain misdemeanor violations associated with escalating violence to the list of offenses requiring DNA samples.  Timeline of Milestones in Virginia s DNA Data Bank program:  1989: Virginia established one of the first DNA Data Banks in the United States.  1993: The first DFS data bank hit occurred in a Northern Virginia case in which a 63-year-old woman was robbed and raped by an unknown assailant.  The  hit  was associated with a 33-year-old suspect who was convicted and sentenced to 30 years for rape, statutory burglary, and attempted sodomy.  1997: Virginia had its first out-of-state success when serial rape cases from Florida were solved through a hit to a Virginia convicted felon.  2002: Then-Governor Mark Warner announced 1,000th cold hit.  2003: Virginia became one of the first states to collect DNA for its data bank from persons arrested for violent felonies, resulting in a first hit just two months after the law was implemented.","Published: April 15, 2015"

The approach involves gold nanoparticles tethered to acid-seeking compounds called pHLIPs. The pHLIPs (pH low-insertion peptides) home in on high acidity of malignant cells, delivering their nanoparticle passengers straight to the cells  doorsteps. The nanoparticles then act as tiny antennas, focusing the energy of radiation in the area directly around the cancer cells. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the research team shows that the approach substantially increases the cancer-killing power of radiation in lab tests.  This study was a good proof of concept,  said Michael Antosh, assistant professor (research) in Brown s Institute for Brain and Neural Systems and the paper s lead author.  We re encouraged by our initial results and we re excited to take the next step and test this in mice.  The team is hopeful that the approach could ultimately improve radiation treatment for cancer patients. By increasing the effectiveness that a given dose of radiation has on cancer, the technique could reduce the overall radiation dose a patient requires, which would in turn reduce side effects. It could also increase the effectiveness of radiation at doses currently administered. Special delivery This research is an extension of work started by Yana Reshetnyak and Oleg Andreev, professors in the URI s Division of Biological and Medical Physics, and professor Donald Engelman of Yale University, the inventors of pHLIP technology. The URI/Yale team had previously developed pHLIPs as a potential delivery system for cancer drugs and diagnostic agents. Cancer cells are generally more acidic than healthy cells, and pHLIPs are natural acid-seekers.  We previously demonstrated that pHLIP-nanogold particles could find and accumulate in tumors established in mice,  Reshetnyak said.  Now our task is to test if we can treat cancer by irradiating tumors with nanogold particles more efficiently in comparison with traditional radiation treatment.  Both theoretical and experimental work had shown that gold nanoparticles could intensify the effect of radiation. The particles absorb up to 100 times more radiation than tissue. Radiation causes the particles to release a stream of electrons into the area around them. If the particles were in close proximity to cancer cells, that stream of electrons would inflict damage on those cells.  The idea here was to bring this all together, combining the nanoparticles with the delivery system and then irradiating them to see if it had the desired effect,  said Leon Cooper, the Thomas J. Watson Sr. Professor of Science at Brown and one of the study s co-authors. Cooper, who shared the Nobel Prize in 1972 for explaining the behavior of electrons in superconductors, has been working for the last several years to better understand biological responses to radiation. Auger effect Gold is an especially good choice for amplifying radiation. When matter is hit by radiation at certain energies, electrons are released through a process known as the photoelectric effect. But gold has an additional source of electron emission, known as the Auger effect, that results from the particular arrangement of electrons orbiting gold atoms. It s the effect of the Auger electrons that the researchers were working to maximize. Working out the quantitative details of the process involved complex calculations and simulations, Cooper said. Auger electrons are low-energy and travel only a very short distance. Their travel distance is so short, in fact, that the electrons may not escape the nanoparticle if the particle is too large. So the researchers had to make sure their particles were small enough to emit those electrons. The short travel distance also means that particles need to be delivered in very close proximity to the cancer cells in order to do damage, hence the need for the pHLIPs. Experiments showed that cancer cells irradiated in the presence of pHLIP-delivered gold had a 24-percent lower survival rate compared to those treated with radiation alone. The pHLIP samples had a 21-percent lower survival compared to irradiation with just gold but no pHLIPs. That suggests that the pHLIPs were effective in getting the gold close enough to the cells to do damage. The next step, the researchers say, is to test the approach in a rodent model, which the team is planning to do soon.  This work is a great example of successful collaboration between Brown and URI,  Andreev said.  We hope that the results of this research moving forward will lead to clinical application of pHLIP-based nanotechnology.

The sensor, which consists of chemically modified carbon nanotubes, could be deployed in  smart packaging  that would offer much more accurate safety information than the expiration date on the package, says Timothy Swager, the John D. MacArthur Professor of Chemistry at MIT. It could also cut down on food waste, he adds.  People are constantly throwing things out that probably aren t bad,  says Swager, who is the senior author of a paper describing the new sensor this week in the journal Angewandte Chemie. The paper s lead author is graduate student Sophie Liu. Other authors are former lab technician Alexander Petty and postdoc Graham Sazama. The sensor is similar to other carbon nanotube devices that Swager s lab has developed in recent years, including one that detects the ripeness of fruit. All of these devices work on the same principle: Carbon nanotubes can be chemically modified so that their ability to carry an electric current changes in the presence of a particular gas. In this case, the researchers modified the carbon nanotubes with metal-containing compounds called metalloporphyrins, which contain a central metal atom bound to several nitrogen-containing rings. Hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the blood, is a metalloporphyrin with iron as the central atom. For this sensor, the researchers used a metalloporphyrin with cobalt at its center. Metalloporphyrins are very good at binding to nitrogen-containing compounds called amines. Of particular interest to the researchers were the so-called biogenic amines, such as putrescine and cadaverine, which are produced by decaying meat. When the cobalt-containing porphyrin binds to any of these amines, it increases the electrical resistance of the carbon nanotube, which can be easily measured.  We use these porphyrins to fabricate a very simple device where we apply a potential across the device and then monitor the current. When the device encounters amines, which are markers of decaying meat, the current of the device will become lower,  Liu says. In this study, the researchers tested the sensor on four types of meat: pork, chicken, cod, and salmon. They found that when refrigerated, all four types stayed fresh over four days. Left unrefrigerated, the samples all decayed, but at varying rates. There are other sensors that can detect the signs of decaying meat, but they are usually large and expensive instruments that require expertise to operate.  The advantage we have is these are the cheapest, smallest, easiest-to-manufacture sensors,  Swager says.  There are several potential advantages in having an inexpensive sensor for measuring, in real time, the freshness of meat and fish products, including preventing foodborne illness, increasing overall customer satisfaction, and reducing food waste at grocery stores and in consumers  homes,  says Roberto Forloni, a senior science fellow at Sealed Air, a major supplier of food packaging, who was not part of the research team. The new device also requires very little power and could be incorporated into a wireless platform Swager s lab recently developed that allows a regular smartphone to read output from carbon nanotube sensors such as this one. The researchers have filed for a patent on the technology and hope to license it for commercial development. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Army Research Office through MIT s Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies. ","Published: April 15, 2015"

Cancer biologists hope to harness that untapped power using an approach known as cancer immunotherapy. Orchestrating a successful immune attack against tumors has proven difficult so far, but a new study from MIT suggests that such therapies could be improved by simultaneously activating both arms of the immune system. Until now, most researchers have focused on one of two strategies: attacking tumors with antibodies, which activate the innate immune system, or stimulating T cells, which form the backbone of the adaptive immune system. By combining these approaches, the MIT team was able to halt the growth of a very aggressive form of melanoma in mice.  An anti-tumor antibody can improve adoptive T-cell therapy to a surprising extent,  says Dane Wittrup, the Carbon P. Dubbs Professor in Chemical Engineering at MIT.  These two different parts of the immune therapy are interdependent and synergistic.  Wittrup, an associate director of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and also a faculty member in the Department of Biological Engineering, is the senior author of a paper describing the work this week in the journal Cancer Cell. Lead authors are graduate students Eric Zhu and Cary Opel and recent PhD recipient Shuning Gai. Enlisting the immune system Antibody drugs for cancer, which include rituximab and Herceptin, are believed to work by binding to cancer proteins and blocking the signals that tell cancer cells to divide uncontrollably. They may also draw the attention of cells belonging to the innate immune system, such as natural killer cells, which can destroy tumor cells. Adoptive T cell therapy, on the other hand, enlists the body s T cells to attack tumors. Billions of T cells flow through the average person s bloodstream at any given time, each specialized to recognize different molecules. However, many tumor proteins do not provoke T cells to attack, so T cells must be removed from the patient and programmed to attack a specific tumor molecule. Wittrup and his colleagues made the discovery that they could generate both types of immune responses while they were experimenting with improving antibody drug performance with a signaling molecule called IL-2, which helps boost immune responses. Scientists have tried this strategy before, and about a dozen such therapies have gone through phase I clinical trials. However, most of these efforts failed, even though the antibody-IL-2 combination usually works very well against cancer cells grown in a lab dish. The MIT team realized that this failure might be caused by the timing of IL-2 delivery. When delivered to cells in a dish, IL-2 sticks around for a long time, amplifying the response of natural killer cells against cancer cells. However, when IL-2 is injected into a patient s bloodstream, the kidneys filter it out within an hour. Wittrup and his colleagues overcame this by fusing IL-2 to part of an antibody molecule, which allows it to circulate in the bloodstream for much longer. In tests in mice with a very aggressive form of melanoma, the researchers found they could stop tumor growth by delivering this engineered form of IL-2, along with antibody drugs, once a week. Immune synergy To their surprise, the researchers found that T cells were the most important component of the anti-tumor response induced by the antibody-IL-2 combination. They believe that the synergy of IL-2-induced cells and cytokines, and the antibody treatment, creates an environment that lets T cells attack more effectively.  The antibody-driven innate response creates an environment such that when the T cells come in, they can kill the tumor. In its absence, the tumor cells establish an environment where the T cells don t work very well,  Wittrup says. Cells called neutrophils, which are considered the immune system s  first line of defense  because they react strongly to foreign invaders that enter the skin through a cut or other injury, were also surprisingly important.  They re a really powerful force in your immune system, but people in immunotherapy don t usually focus on neutrophils. They don t really consider them as a viable tool,  Zhu says.  It pointed us to the idea that although T cells and natural killer cells are important, maybe we re forgetting about a part of the immune system that is also really important and could help us achieve our goals of ultimately curing the tumors.  The researchers also found that when they delivered an antibody, IL-2, and T cells targeted to the tumor, the adoptively transferred T cells killed cancer cells much more successfully than when only T cells were delivered. In 80 to 90 percent of the mice, tumors disappeared completely; even when tumor cells were reinjected into the mice months after the original treatment, their immune systems destroyed the cells, preventing new tumors from forming In a related paper that appeared recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, the MIT team also found that delivering IL-2 bound to any kind of antibody, even if the antibody did not target a protein on the tumor cell surface, would halt or slow tumor growth, especially if additional doses of the antibody alone were also given. Graduate student Alice Tzeng was the lead author of that study. The researchers are now exploring additional proteins that could be added to the IL-2 and antibody combination to make immunotherapy more effective. In the meantime, simply giving patients more prolonged exposure to IL-2 could improve the effectiveness of existing antibody drugs, Wittrup says. The research was funded by the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute for General Medical Sciences, and the National Science Foundation. ","Published: April 15, 2015"

ABX464 is a novel small molecule in phase II clinical trial that inhibits HIV replication through an entirely new mechanism. The pioneering research described in the scientific publication was conducted by six premier research institutions from France, Canada and Switzerland, in addition to the ABIVAX laboratories, under the leadership of Professor Jamal Tazi of the Molecular Genetics Institute at CNRS in Montpellier, France. The research team was able to demonstrate that: 1. ABX464 blocks viral replication by preventing the export of viral RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in infected cells. This transport is normally mediated by a viral protein called Rev, and the activity of Rev is efficiently inhibited by ABX464. Never targeted before, Rev has been postulated of potential interest for HIV treatment for some time, but ABX464 is the first molecule under development aimed at inhibiting it. Jamal Tazi, senior author of the article, stresses that  ABX464 targets an event after the genetic material of the virus has been integrated in the cell. This way, ABX464 not only prevents the infection of new cells, but it is the only drug to date that can act on already infected cells and prevent the synthesis of new viruses.  He added,  Therefore the difficult-to-reach reservoir of infected cells remaining under current HIV therapy may become reachable.  ABX464 leads to a significant and sustained reduction of viral load, which lasts for several weeks after cessation of treatment in a preclinical reference model. In contrast, the control group, receiving current state of the art triple anti-HIV therapy, had an immediate rebound of the viral load after stopping the treatment. Current treatments in patients merely hold the virus at bay whereas ABX464 may lead to durable suppression of viral load. 2. ABX464 does not affect the physiological cellular RNA-processing in humans. This is an important finding, as it suggests that ABX464 is specific for HIV RNAs and does not influence the synthesis of human proteins. 3. ABX464 does not lead to HIV mutants that become resistant to treatment. Thus, in contrast to all other anti-HIV drugs, ABX464 may be effective as a monotherapy. Professor Mark Wainberg, former President of the International AIDS Society and co-author of the publication, said  We are very encouraged by the data obtained with ABX464, which has the potential to become part of a functional cure strategy for patients with HIV and AIDS.  The supplementary information in the Retrovirology article reports successful toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies. Didier Scherrer, Ph.D., Vice-President of Small Molecules R&D at ABIVAX said,  As a result, ABIVAX has received authorization to carry out clinical studies with ABX464, following the phase I trial in human volunteers which was initiated in early 2014. Based on the safety and PK data, ABX464 progressed to a phase IIa trial in patients, which was begun several weeks ago. The goal of this study is to determine the optimal dose and frequency of administration.  Professor Hartmut J. Ehrlich, M.D., CEO of ABIVAX, concluded,  We are very excited about the data obtained so far with ABX464, as they indicate that ABX464 is safe and may be less frequently administered than standard therapies, thereby potentially improving outcomes and compliance, helping to reduce healthcare costs and offering broader access to treatment.  ABX464 is the first candidate molecule coming from ABIVAX s proprietary anti-viral drug technology platform that focuses on viral RNAs. It has been generated from an in-depth understanding of the processing of viral RNA within the human host cell.","Published: April 15, 2015"

They work by sticking to specific proteins found on the surface of cancer cells, flagging them up to be killed by the immune system. Unfortunately, a number of patients do not respond or develop resistance to treatment. The findings, published in the journal Cancer Cell, show that resistance to many types of antibody drugs can be overcome by preventing cancer cells from  hiding  from immune cells. The research was carried out by scientists at the University of Southampton and Swedish biotech company, BioInvent International. The researchers, who were funded by Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research and Cancer Research UK, have shown that some cancer cells are able to draw monoclonal antibodies inside themselves, making them invisible to immune cells. However, the researchers showed that a new antibody, called BI-1206, can effectively prevent this drug destruction process and enhance cancer killing by binding to a molecule called Fc RIIB. BI-1206 showed remarkable success in mice in overcoming resistance to monoclonal antibodies like rituximab, currently used to treat different types of lymphoma and leukaemia. The study, led by Dr Ali Roghanian and Professor Mark Cragg in Southampton and Dr Ingrid Teige and Professor Bj rn Frend us in Sweden, represents a six year endeavour into how to improve antibody therapeutics for blood cancers. Professor Cragg, Professor of Experimental Cancer Research at the University of Southampton, said:  With more monoclonal antibody treatments being developed, there is an urgent need to understand how tumours become resistant to them and develop ways to overcome it. Not only does BI-1206 appear to be able to reverse resistance to a range of monoclonal antibodies, it is also effective at directly killing cancer cells itself.  The new drug will now be tested in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in an early stage clinical trial. The trial will test safety in humans and if it has any anti-cancer effects when combined with rituximab. This is a new collaborative venture between Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research, Cancer Research UK and its development and commercialisation arm Cancer Research Technology, aimed at accelerating the delivery of promising new treatments into blood cancers. Professor Chris Bunce, Research Director at Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research, said:  Targeted drugs, like monoclonal antibodies, have shown great promise in recent years in effectively treating a patient s disease while minimising side effects. BI-1206 could have a real impact on survival for a significant number of patients.  Bj rn Frend us, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of BioInvent, and honorary Professor at the University of Southampton, said:  BI-1206 binds very specifically to the inhibitory FcyRIIB, a receptor that acts as a brake to dampen critical anti-cancer immune cell s function and to eliminate therapeutic antibody from the targeted tumor cell surface.  Emma Smith, senior science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said:  This exciting research has the potential to be a game-changer for people with white blood cell cancers that don t respond, or have stopped responding, to treatments like rituximab. It could also make immunotherapy for other types of cancer more effective too.  The work was carried out in mice, so we ll have to wait for the results from clinical trials to find out if the treatment is safe and effective in people, but it s certainly a promising approach and could lead to more potent drug combinations that benefit patients.

But because cancerous tumors have the unique ability to activate alternative pathways, they are often able to evade these therapies -- and regrow. Moreover, tumors contain a small portion of cancer stem cells that are believed to be responsible for tumor initiation, metastasis and drug resistance. Thus, eradicating cancer stem cells may be critical for achieving long-lasting remission, but there are no drugs available that specifically attack cancer stem cells. Now a research team led by investigators in the Cancer Research Institute at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), has identified an inhibitor of the Pin1 enzyme that can address both of these challenges in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and triple negative breast cancer. Their surprising discovery demonstrates that the vitamin A derivative ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid), a treatment for APL that is considered to be the first example of modern targeted cancer therapy, can block multiple cancer-driving pathways and, at the same time, eliminate cancer stem cells by degrading the Pin1 enzyme. Reported online in Nature Medicine, these novel findings suggest a promising new way to fight cancer   particularly cancers that are aggressive or drug resistant.  Pin1 changes protein shape through proline-directed phosphorylation, which is a major control mechanism for disease,  explains co-senior author Kun Ping Lu, MD, PhD, Director of Translational Therapeutics in the Cancer Research Institute at BIDMC and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School who co-discovered the enzyme in 1996.  Pin1 is a common key regulator in many types of cancer, and as a result, can control over 50 oncogenes and tumor suppressors, many of which are known to also control cancer stem cells.  Until now, agents that inhibit Pin1 have been developed mainly through rational drug design. Although these inhibitors have proven to be active against Pin1 in the test tube, when they are tested in vitro in a cell model or in vivo in a living animal they are unable to efficiently enter cells to successfully inhibit Pin1 function. In this new work, co-senior author Xiao Zhen Zhou, MD, an investigator in BIDMC s Division of Translational Therapeutics and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, decided to take a different approach to identify Pin1 inhibitors: She developed a mechanism-based high throughput screen to identify compounds that were targeting active Pin1.  We had previously identified Pin1 substrate-mimicking peptide inhibitors,  explains Zhou.  We therefore used these as a probe in a competition binding assay and screened approximately 8,200 chemical compounds, including both approved drugs and other known bioactive compounds.  To increase screening success, Zhou chose a probe that specifically binds to the Pin1 enzyme active site very tightly, an approach that is not commonly used for this kind of screen.  Initially, it appeared that the screening results had no positive hits, so we had to manually sift through them looking for the one that would bind to Pin1. We eventually spotted cis retinoic acid, which has the same chemical formula as all-trans retinoic acid [ATRA], but with a different chemical structure.  It turned out, Zhou explains, that Pin1 prefers binding to ATRA and cis retinoic acid needs to convert ATRA in order to bind Pin1. ATRA was first discovered for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in 1987.  Before tamoxifen or other targeted drugs, there was ATRA,  says Lu. It was originally thought that ATRA was successfully treating APL by inducing cell differentiation, causing cancer cells to change into normal cells by activating the cellular retinoic acid receptors. But as these new findings reveal, although this differentiation activity is obvious, it is not the mechanism that is actually behind ATRA s successful outcomes in treating APL.  While it has been previously shown that ATRA s ability to degrade the leukemia-causing fusion oncogene PML-RAR causes ATRA to stop the leukemia stem cells that drive APL, the underlying mechanism has remained elusive,  says Lu.  Our new high throughput drug screening has revealed the ATRA drug target, unexpectedly showing that ATRA directly binds, inhibits and ultimately degrades active Pin1 selectively in cancer cells. The Pin1-ATRA complex structure suggests that ATRA is trapped in the Pin1 active site by mimicking an unreleasable enzyme substrate. Importantly, ATRA-induced Pin1 ablation degrades the fusion oncogene PML-RAR and treats APL in cell and animal models as well as in human patients.  APL develops when two tumor suppressors fuse together to become an oncogene,  adds co-author Pier Paolo Pandolfi, MD, PhD, Director of the Cancer Center at BIDMC whose own pioneering work revealed the molecular underpinnings of APL and led to its cure.  These new findings demonstrate that by inhibiting Pin1, you can degrade this fusion oncogene, thereby stopping cancer stem cells from replicating. This is a critically important discovery that will impact the treatment of other forms of cancer, since Pin1 inhibition is also affecting other key oncogenes.  To that end, the authors also tested ATRA in triple-negative breast cancer, one of the most aggressive types of breast cancer. They discovered that ATRA-induced Pin1 ablation also potently inhibits triple-negative breast cancer growth in human cells and in animal models by simultaneously turning off many oncogenes and turning on many tumor suppressors. These new results, say the authors, provide a rationale for developing longer half-life ATRA or more potent and specific Pin1-targeted ATRA variants for cancer treatment.  The current ATRA drug has a very short half life of only 45 minutes in humans,  explains Lu.  We think that a more potent Pin1 inhibitor will be able to target many  dream targets,  that are not currently druggable. ATRA appears to be well tolerated with minimal side effects and offers a promising new approach for targeting a Pin1-dependent common oncogenic mechanism in numerous cancer-driving pathways in cancer and cancer stem cells. This is especially critical for treating aggressive or drug-resistant cancers.

This study, for the first time, provides biological evidence of repair of damaged myelin in the human brain, and advances the field of neuro-reparative therapies,  said study lead author Diego Cadavid, MD, with Biogen in Cambridge, Mass., and a fellow with the American Academy of Neurology. The Phase 2 study involved 82 people who had their first incident of acute optic neuritis, a disease that typically affects one eye and is characterized by inflammation, damage to the nerve fibers and loss of myelin within the optic nerve. It is estimated that about half of people with optic neuritis will later develop multiple sclerosis. All participants were treated with high dose steroids and then randomly selected with equal probability to receive either the experimental antibody, called anti-LINGO-1, or a placebo once every four weeks, for a total of six doses. Participants were then assessed every four weeks for six months and a final visit at eight months. The drug s effectiveness in repairing myelin was evaluated by comparing the recovery of the optic nerve latency in the damaged eye at six and eight months to the normal unaffected eye at the start of the study. The main finding of the study focused on the latency of the visual evoked potential (VEP), a test that measures the visual system s ability to conduct electrical signals between the retina and the brain. The results showed that people treated with the experimental drug and who did not miss more than one dose (per protocol population) had significantly improved conduction as measured by latency recovery compared to people who received the placebo. At six months, those who received the drug improved on average by 7.55 milliseconds, or 34 percent, compared to placebo. The effect continued to eight months with an average improvement of 9.13 milliseconds or 41 percent over placebo. In addition, the percentage of subjects whose VEP latency in the affected eye recovered to normal or nearly normal (within 10 percent of the normal eye) more than doubled, from 26 percent on placebo to 53 percent on the drug. A substudy using an exploratory method of measuring latency called multifocal VEP revealed similar treatment effects.  More studies are needed to evaluate whether these changes lead to clinical improvement,  said Cadavid. A second study of anti-LINGO-1 in people with multiple sclerosis is ongoing.

ECL-1 is a state-of-the-art life sciences laboratory that scientists can remotely access via the Internet where automated robotics conduct experiments exactly as specified by the user.  The ECL is a virtualized laboratory and allows scientists to abstract away the manual labor currently inherent in scientific research,  said Emerald Therapeutics Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Dr. D.J. Kleinbaum.  Scientists are able to design and drive their experiments as if they were standing in front of the instrument themselves, giving them full control over the process without the grunt work and friction usually associated with research. We hope this system will empower people in the same way that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) did in the semiconductor industry and Amazon Web Services (AWS) did in the IT world.  Emerald unveiled the ECL in mid-2014 and announced that its invitation-only beta trial would begin in Q1 of 2015. Since then, the company built a new production facility from the ground up and installed over $3 million of scientific instrumentation including liquid handlers, mass spectrometers, HPLCs (high pressure liquid chromatography), flow cytometers, DNA synthesizers, epifluorescence microscopes, plate readers, lyophilizers and a few dozen others. The ECL offers over forty different experiment types that its beta users can be running in under 48 hours. Over the next eighteen months, Emerald will be expanding the number of experiments to over 100, enabling scientists to do any standard in vitro life sciences experiment on the ECL, including Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), gas chromatography, flow chemistry, and DNA sequencing. According to Dr. Brian Frezza, Emerald s other Co-Founder and Co-CEO, all of the ECL s automation is just a tool to gain full computational closure around each experiment.  Capturing everything relevant to the experiment in robotics allows us to ensure that every experiment has push-button reproducibility. In addition, we re able to create a system that automatically captures extreme levels of detail about the experiments beyond just the raw data, including sample tracking, protocol information, controls and maintenance information, and environmental data. In many ways, the real value of our system is not in the robotics, but rather in the ability to capture, share, search, and reproduce experimental results.  Dr. Frezza also explained that one of the keys to Emerald s approach was its unique strategy for software development.  Every experiment interface is written and designed by scientists, for scientists,  said Frezza.  Our Scientific Development team includes people from a diverse cross-section of scientific disciplines and ensures that the interface people will be using was written by scientists who have done that experiment hundreds of times before.  The ECL grew organically out of Emerald s stealth therapeutic initiative. As a result, it is quite full-featured and well-tested: Emerald s research team has already run over 500,000 samples through the system. One of the reasons this team has been able to handle such a large workload is the efficiency gains of running experiments through the ECL: individual scientists at Emerald run between ten and fifteen experiments per day, as compared to one to three experiments per day at other research organizations. Now the company will start taking a limited number of users off its waitlist of over 300 scientists and labs that signed up after the 2014 unveiling, including scientists from Big Pharma, top universities, and biotech start-up companies. Customers will get access to both the experimental capabilities of the system and to its full suite of data visualization, analysis, and sharing tools. One of the beta users is from the academic sector, Sanjiv Sam Gambhir, MD, PhD, the chairman of the Department of Radiology at Stanford University School of Medicine and a professor by courtesy in the departments of Bioengineering and Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford University. An example customer from the biotech startup space is Ethan Oren Perlstein, PhD, founder and CEO of Perlstein Lab, a leading biotech startup, who is using the ECL to research orphan drug treatments. Perlstein has a PhD in molecular and cell biology from Harvard University, and was a Lewis-Sigler Fellow at Princeton University.  Our biggest expense in 2014 was equipment, the next biggest slice was payroll and that s the reality for any biotech start-up,  said Perlstein.  With the ECL, we can extend the work we do at our lab without the added equipment and staff. Emerald has developed a model that can have a huge impact on biotech research.

His work focuses on developing fluorescence microscopy approaches to study the cellular and molecular dynamics of metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Metastasis is linked to mortality in most types of cancer, and a matter of intense investigation around the world. Metastatic invasion is challenging to study because it occurs randomly over large scales of time and space, and sensitively depends on features of the local tumour microenvironment. Speaking about his work, Professor Anderson says,  My research group studies cell migration in the context of cancer metastasis. Our research goal is to understand the influence of the tumour microenvironment on disease progression and response to therapy, especially anti-metastatic treatment.  Continuing about his choice of instrument, Professor Anderson says the LaVision BioTec  TriM Scope allows us to investigate cellular and molecular interactions in 3-dimensional environments including, for example, organotypic cultures and organoids; also ex vivo and in vivo tissues. The only way for us to answer questions about the tumour microenvironment, and the effects of drugs in different regions of the tumour, is to image real mouse tumours. The only approach which allows us to do this with sub-cellular resolution of multi-photon microscopy. The TriM Scope is particularly important because it is optimized for deep tissue imaging and for fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), here used to image FRET reporters which tell us about the activation state of pathways critical to the regulation of cell migration. This approach lets us map the spatial and temporal response of key signalling pathways to therapeutic intervention.  Prior to using the TriM Scope, his group used various multiphoton & confocal systems as well as the frequency domain FLIM systems from Lambert Instruments. The TriM Scope has brought a number of benefits, as outlined by Professor Anderson.  I think the external detectors are more sensitive due to their position in direct proximity to the back focal aperture of the objective. This makes optimized custom configurations more readily available to us. Also, LaVision's experience working with OPO lasers was one of the reasons we bought their system compared to the competition. No one else has adaptive optics integrated into the scan head. We were also attracted by the cloud scanner as it offers the possibility to increase signal at intermediate levels of magnification.

As part of the collaboration, CRT and Medivir will conduct a two-year research programme to optimize and develop small molecules targeting the cell surface protein ADAM8, which has been linked to tumour survival, cell invasion and metastasis. Under the terms of the agreement Medivir receives an exclusive, global license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize ADAM8 inhibitor drugs resulting from development. CRT receives an upfront payment and future success milestones as well as royalties on sales which are shared with the academic collaborators. Blocking ADAM8 in mice with pancreatic cancer prevented the spread of the disease, shrunk tumours and significantly extended lifespan. This is thought to be due to its involvement in cell adhesion, cell migration, inflammation and the growth of blood vessels   key processes that many cancers rely on for growth and development. High levels of the protein have been linked with more aggressive tumours including those in pancreatic, breast, brain, prostate, lung, head and neck, and kidney cancers. This research will be led by Professor J rg Bartsch as head of the TransMIT-Project Division for Research in Neuro-Oncology at TransMIT GmbH, located at Marburg University in Germany, in collaboration with Medivir. Prof. Bartsch previously worked at King s College London where the initial patent application was filed by King s College IP and Licensing team. Further proof of concept studies were funded by Cancer Research UK at King s College.  We are very glad and excited to see this collaboration come to life. The synergy of expertise between Medivir and our Laboratory forms an excellent platform for successful exploration of this first-in-class approach to targeted therapy against ADAM8.

The work, reported in Nature, brings fresh optimism to the field of HIV immunotherapy and suggests new strategies for fighting or even preventing HIV infection. In a person infected with HIV, there is an ongoing arms race between the virus and the body s immune system. Even as the body produces new antibodies that target the virus, the virus is constantly mutating to escape, managing to stay just a few steps ahead. The new study, conducted in Michel Nussenzweig s Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, finds that administration of a potent antibody, called 3BNC117, can catch HIV off guard and reduce viral loads. HIV antibodies previously tested in humans had shown disappointing results. 3BNC117 belongs to a new generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies that potently fight a wide range of HIV strains.  What s special about these antibodies is that they have activity against over 80 percent of HIV strains and they are extremely potent,  says Marina Caskey, assistant professor of clinical investigation in the Nussenzweig lab and co-first author of the study. 3BN117, which was originally isolated by Johannes Scheid in the Nussenzweig laboratory, targets the CD4 binding site of the HIV envelope, and the CD4 receptor is the primary site of attachment of HIV to host cells, 3BNC117 shows activity against 195 out of 237 HIV strains. Broadly neutralizing antibodies are produced naturally in some 10 to 30 percent of people with HIV, but only after several years of infection. By that time the virus in their bodies has typically evolved to escape even these powerful antibodies. However, by isolating and then cloning these antibodies, researchers are able to harness them as therapeutic agents against HIV infections that have had less time to prepare. Earlier work in the Nussenzweig lab had demonstrated that these potent antibodies could prevent or suppress infection in mouse and non-human primate models of HIV. But these animal models are very rough approximations of human infections, explains Caskey. The mice must be genetically engineered to be susceptible to HIV and therefore lack an intact immune system, and the primates used in HIV studies can only be infected with a simian version of the virus. The proof of principle awaited human trials. In the new study, uninfected and HIV-infected individuals were intravenously given a single dose of the antibody and monitored for 56 days. At the highest dosage level tested in the study, 30 milligrams per kilogram of weight, all eight infected individuals treated showed up to 300-fold decreases in the amount of virus measured in their blood, with most reaching their lowest viral load one week after treatment. The drop in viral load depended on the individual s starting viral load and also the sensitivity of their particular strains of HIV to the antibody. This is the first time that the new generation of HIV antibodies has been tested in humans. Not only was a single dose of 3BN117 well tolerated and effective in temporarily reducing viral loads, in some individuals it remained active in the body for a long time. In half of the individuals receiving the highest dose, viral loads remained below starting levels even at the end of the 8-week study period and resistance to 3BNC117 did not occur. Researchers also believe that antibodies may be able to enhance the patient s immune responses against HIV, which can in turn lead to better control of the infection. In addition, antibodies like 3BNC117 may be able to kill viruses hidden in infected cells, which serve as viral reservoirs inaccessible to current antiretroviral drugs. Most likely, 3BNC117, like other anti-retrovirals, will need to be used in combination with other antibodies or antiretroviral drugs to keep infections under control.  One antibody alone, like one drug alone, will not be sufficient to suppress viral load for a long time because resistance will arise,  says Caskey. One important benefit is the dosing schedule: an antibody therapy for HIV might require treatment just once every few months, compared to daily regimens of antiretroviral drugs that are now the front-line treatment for HIV.  In contrast to conventional antiretroviral therapy, antibody-mediated therapy can also engage the patient s immune cells, which can help to better neutralize the virus,  says co-first author Florian Klein, also assistant professor of clinical investigation in the Nussenzweig laboratory. Besides the possibility of treatment, the study also raises hopes for an HIV vaccine. If researchers can induce an uninfected person s immune system to generate potent antibodies such as 3BNC117, it might be enough to block the HIV infection before it can be established. Ongoing clinical research in Nussenzweig s lab and The Rockefeller University Hospital aims to address the impact of additional broadly neutralizing antibodies, alone or in combination, on viral load in HIV-infected patients.","Published: April 14, 2015"

DLBCL is usually curable, but it recurs in up to 40% of patients and is then often incurable. Because of the risk of recurrence, patients are monitored for up to 5 years after disease remission.  Currently, CT or PET scans are used to monitor patients during and after treatment. Repeated imaging tests pose both a potential health risk from radiation exposure and a financial burden. Relapses of DLBCL also most likely occur due to residual disease below levels that imaging can detect. For these reasons, researchers have been searching for better monitoring techniques. Past studies have shown that tumor cells can be detected in blood and bone marrow by searching for tumor-specific gene sequences. However, DLBCL has fewer circulating tumor cells relative to many other cancers. A research team led by Dr. Wyndham Wilson at NIH s National Cancer Institute (NCI) tested next-generation sequencing to assess whether cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from DLBCL could be detected in blood serum and used to monitor the disease. The researchers did a retrospective analysis of DLBCL patients who received treatment according to standard protocols in clinical trials between May 1993 and December 2013. Serum samples were collected before treatment, during treatment, and for many years afterward. CT scans were done at the same time as the blood testing as part of standard surveillance. The participants were followed for a median of 11 years after completion of therapy. Reults appeared online on April 2, 2015, in Lancet Oncology. Among 107 patients who achieved complete remission, those who developed detectable ctDNA during surveillance were over 200 times more likely to have disease progression than those who had no detectable ctDNA. The researchers also found that ctDNA monitoring could detect cancer recurrence a median of 3.5 months before clinical evidence of disease. In addition, the ctDNA test was able to identify patients at high risk of treatment failure during treatment, a strategy known as interim monitoring.  Even with frequent CT imaging, administered for a median of 11 times per patient in our study, early disease detection was suboptimal. Indeed, a recent study suggested that surveillance CT scans might be no better than an up-to-date patient history and physical exams, supporting the need for more effective monitoring technologies,  Wilson says. The results suggest that ctDNA monitoring could be used to improve outcomes for patients with DLBCL. Early disease detection based on ctDNA might also be used to precisely monitor the effects of novel therapies.","Published: April 14, 2015"

VIB, a leading life sciences institute in Flanders (Belgium), will become a shareholder alongside ThromboGenics in this new oncology venture. ThromboGenics will be the majority shareholder. TB-403 is a humanized monoclonal antibody against placental growth factor (PlGF). PlGF is expressed in several types of cancer, including medulloblastoma. High expression of the PlGF receptor neuropilin 1 has been shown to correlate with poor overall survival. Medulloblastoma is a rare, life-threatening brain tumor that mainly affects children. Treatment with TB-403 in relevant animal models for medulloblastoma has demonstrated beneficial effects on tumor growth and survival. The antibody can potentially be used in other pediatric cancer indications, including neuroblastoma. In February 2013, a paper in Cell (Cell, 152, 1065-76, 2013) highlighted for the first time that PlGF plays a vital role in the brain and that its expression is required for the growth and spread of medulloblastoma. The paper was based on pre-clinical research conducted by Prof Rakesh Jain from the Massachusetts General Hospital at Harvard (Boston) and the team of Prof Peter Carmeliet from VIB/ KU Leuven. Oncurious now plans to start a Phase I/IIa program with TB-403 in medulloblastoma patients. Enrollment of the first patient is expected for the end of 2015. The favorable safety profile of TB-403 has already been demonstrated in clinical trials in patients with other diseases. Dr Patrik De Haes, CEO of ThromboGenics said,  The formation of Oncurious is an important development for ThromboGenics, which will allow us to even more focus our efforts on achieving our goals in the ophthalmology space. This new venture should also enable an acceleration of the development of TB-403 for the treatment of medulloblastoma, a devastating cancer that affects children and adolescents. I would like to thank VIB for supporting us in this new venture and for providing access to exciting basic research that, in time, will allow Oncurious to build an oncology pipeline.  Johan Cardoen, Managing Director of VIB said,  We are excited that we can jointly translate the potential of VIB research by Prof. Peter Carmeliet into a reality for patients. We believe that TB-403 has the potential to greatly improve the treatment of medulloblastoma and a number of other pediatric tumours, an area of great medical need. This collaboration illustrates the value of excellence-driven basic research at VIB and ThromboGenics, and the pro-active approach to  make the difference for patients . We are confident that together with ThromboGenics, we can develop Oncurious into a leading oncology company. BioInvent International AB will act as a co-development partner for this oncology project.ThromboGenics has retained the exclusive license for use of TB-403 in ophthalmic indications.","Published: April 14, 2015"

The team found that lung tissue has more dexterity in repairing tissue than once thought. Researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and Duke University, including co-senior authors Jon Epstein, MD, chair of the department of Cell and Developmental Biology, and Brigid L.M Hogan, Duke Medicine, along with co-first authors Rajan Jain, MD, a cardiologist and instructor in the Department of Medicine and Christina E. Barkauskas, also from Duke, report their findings in Nature Communications.  It s as if the lung cells can regenerate from one another as needed to repair missing tissue, suggesting that there is much more flexibility in the system than we have previously appreciated,  says Epstein.  These aren t classic stem cells that we see regenerating the lung. They are mature lung cells that awaken in response to injury. We want to learn how the lung regenerates so that we can stimulate the process in situations where it is insufficient, such as in patients with COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].  The two types of airway cells in the alveoli, the gas-exchanging part of the lung, have very different functions, but can morph into each other under the right circumstances, the investigators found. Long, thin Type 1 cells are where gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) are exchanged   the actual breath. Type 2 cells secrete surfactant, a soapy substance that helps keep airways open. In fact, premature babies need to be treated with surfactant to help them breathe. The team showed in mouse models that these two types of cells originate from a common precursor stem cell in the embryo. Next, the team used other mouse models in which part of the lung was removed and single cell culture to study the plasticity of cell types during lung regrowth. The team showed that Type 1 cells can give rise to Type 2 cells, and vice-versa. The Duke team had previously established that Type 2 cells produce surfactant and function as progenitors in adult mice, demonstrating differentiation into gas-exchanging Type 1 cells. The ability of Type I cells to give rise to alternate lineages had not been previously reported.  We decided to test that hypothesis about Type 1 cells,  says Jain.  We found that Type 1 cells give rise to the Type 2 cells over about three weeks in various models of regeneration. We saw new cells growing back into these new areas of the lung. It s as if the lung knows it has to grow back and can call into action some Type 1 cells to help in that process.  This is one of the first studies to show that a specialized cell type that was thought to be at the end of its ability to differentiate can revert to an earlier state under the right conditions. In this case, it was not by using a special formula of transcription factors, but by inducing damage to tell the body to repair itself and that it needs new cells of a certain type to do that. The team is also applying the approaches outlined in this paper to cells in the intestine and skin to study basic ideas of stem cell maintenance and differentiation to relate back to similar mechanisms in the heart. They also hope to apply this knowledge to such other lung conditions as acute respiratory distress syndrome and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, where the alveoli cannot get enough oxygen into the blood.  We want to know if we can, and how, to make new lung cells as work-arounds for diseased alveoli cells,  says Jain.

RP is a group of hereditary diseases of the eye that lead to progressive loss of sight due to cells in the retina becoming damaged and eventually dying. ReNeuron has worked with world-leading collaborators and academic institutions in the retinal disease field to successfully take its retinitis pigmentosa programme through pre-clinical development. These include the Schepens Eye Research Institute/Massachusetts Eye and Ear (an affiliate of Harvard Medical School), UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital and the US-based Foundation Fighting Blindness, the world s leading private source of research funding for inherited retinal diseases. The pre-clinical programme has also benefited from UK Government funding under a BioMedical Catalyst grant, awarded in 2013. Pre-clinical studies carried out in disease models by the Company s academic collaborators have demonstrated that, when transplanted into the retina, ReNeuron s retinal progenitor cell technology has the potential to preserve existing photoreceptors, potentially reducing or halting further deterioration of vision. In addition, the progenitor cells have been shown to mature into functional photoreceptors that engraft into the photoreceptor layer, bringing the possibility of restored vision. The proposed Phase I/II clinical trial will be conducted at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston, a world-renowned clinical centre for the treatment of retinal diseases. The trial design is an open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the hRPC stem cell therapy candidate in up to 15 patients with advanced RP. The method of administration of the hRPCs will be a single sub-retinal injection. The primary endpoint of the study is safety, with patients being followed up for 12 months post-treatment with monitoring including measurements of visual acuity. Subject to regulatory and local ethics approvals, ReNeuron expects to be able to commence the clinical trial in the second half of this year. ReNeuron s cell therapy candidate for RP has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in both Europe and the US by the European Commission and the FDA, respectively. Orphan Drug Designation is typically granted to drug programmes that potentially provide significant benefit to patients with rare diseases that are life-threatening or chronically debilitating. In acknowledgment of the relatively small patient populations involved, commercial and other incentives are provided to developers of orphan drugs. Dr Eric Pierce, Director, Retinal Degenerations Service at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, and Principal Investigator for the clinical trial, commented:  We are pleased to be working with ReNeuron on this important Phase I/II clinical trial. The human Retinal Progenitor Cells being tested in the study are promising since they can make photoreceptors. The implanted cells may not only prevent degeneration of patients' vision but may possibly restore some vision by replacing degenerated photoreceptor cells. The work leading to this clinical trial began over 15 years ago in the laboratory of Michael Young PhD, de Gunzburg Scholar and Co Director of the Ocular Regenerative Medicine Institute at the Schepens Eye Research Institute/Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School.  Olav Helleb , Chief Executive Officer of ReNeuron, commented:  We are delighted to have progressed our hRPC stem cell therapy candidate for RP to the point of submitting an application to conduct a clinical trial in the US. Once approved and commenced, the proposed Phase I/II clinical trial in RP patients will be the third clinical study ongoing with ReNeuron s cell therapy candidates, alongside our Phase II clinical trial in stroke and our Phase I clinical trial in critical limb ischaemia. The proposed RP clinical trial initiates the Company s clinical activities in the US, a very significant milestone in the development of ReNeuron as a global leader in the stem cell therapy field.

Officially named TRPA1 (pronounced  trip A1 ), the newly visualized protein resides in the cellular membrane of sensory nerve cells. It detects certain chemical agents originating outside our bodies-pungent irritants found in substances ranging from wasabi to tear gas-but is also triggered by pain-inducing signals originating within, especially those that arise in response to tissue damage and inflammation.  The pain system is there to warn us when we need to avoid things that can cause injury, but also to enhance protective mechanisms,  said David Julius, PhD, professor and chair of UCSF s Department of Physiology, and co-senior author of the new study, which appears in the April 8, 2015 online issue of Nature.  We ve known that TRPA1 is very important in sensing environmental irritants, inflammatory pain, and itch, and so knowing more about how TRPA1 works is important for understanding basic pain mechanisms. Of course, this information may also help guide the design of new analgesic drugs.  TRPA1 receptor proteins form pores called ion channels in sensory nerve cell membranes. These channels, normally closed, open in response to certain chemical signals, which allows ions to pass into the cell s interior, triggering a warning impulse. But without knowing enough about the receptor s overall structure to see where a given compound might connect, designing a drug to alleviate pain by controlling the action of the ion channel is something of a shot in the dark. Julius and co-senior author Yifan Cheng, PhD, associate professor of biochemistry and biophysics, were able to capture images of TRPA1 that reveal its structure in three dimensions, including a cleft in which an experimental drug molecule sits when it binds to the channel.  A few drugs have been developed that target TRPA1, and in our 3-D structure we can see where one such drug binds,  said Julius.  This provides important insight into how this one major class of drugs interacts with TRPA1 and thus how it may work to block channel function.  UCSF postdoctoral fellows and co-first authors Candice Paulsen, PhD, and Jean-Paul Armache, PhD, spearheaded the TRPA1 project. Yuan Gao, a graduate student in Cheng s lab, also took part in the work. The team used an approach called electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM), an imaging technique in which proteins are bombarded with electrons at very low temperatures. Thanks to a number of innovative hardware and software advances-some developed at UCSF by Cheng and David Agard, PhD, professor of biophysics and biochemistry and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator-cryo-EM has undergone a revolution in image quality over the past several years. Using these tools, the group imaged TRPA1 at a resolution of about 4 angstroms. By way of comparison, the thickness of a credit card is about 8 million angstroms. Julius and Cheng began their cryo-EM collaborations about six years ago when they were in pursuit of the structure of a related channel called TRPV1. Sometimes called the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1 can be triggered by the chemical that lends  heat  to chili peppers, but it also responds to actual heat when temperatures reach uncomfortably high levels. TRPV1 was the first protein of such small size to be imaged to near-atomic resolution by cryo-EM, work that was reported in Nature in December 2013. The determination of TRPV1 s structure by cryo-EM  sent shockwaves through the field of structural biology,  Cheng said, because many researchers had dismissed the method as  blob-ology : until quite recently cryo-EM s resolution-about 15 angstroms at best-was far too coarse to discern the subtleties of structure in molecules as small as TRP ion channels. For decades, X-ray crystallography, which involves first coaxing a protein of interest to crystallize, and then analyzing diffraction patterns created as X-rays pass through the crystal, has been the standard method of determining molecular structures. While crystallography can attain resolutions below 3 angstroms, it requires large quantities of a protein. Moreover, obtaining a usable crystal can take years, and many biologically important proteins-especially membrane proteins, which are crucial to cellular signaling-have never been successfully crystallized. TRP channels were among these, so  we came at it from a different angle,  said Cheng.  Since crystallization was so difficult, we decided to try cryo-EM, which bypasses this requirement.  For cryo-EM, the proteins of interest are placed in an aqueous solution, then frozen in a very thin sheet of ice, so quickly that the water doesn t have time to form crystals. It is critical that the ice remains in a glassy state, because formation of any ice crystals would damage proteins embedded within ice and interfere with determining the structure of the proteins in their native conformation. With many copies of the proteins suspended in this glassy ice, like insects trapped in amber, the researchers capture as many as 100,000 images, then computationally combine these thousands of two-dimensional views to generate the three-dimensional structure of the protein. The images Julius and Cheng s group produced for the TRPA1 ion channel show it in three different states-closed, open, and partially open-a range that offers a lot of insight into the channel s workings. Though the images of TRPA1 generated in the new study represent only slightly different conformations, the scientists expect to generate additional structures in more distinct conformations in future research. The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the UCSF Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research. Co-first author Paulsen was supported by a Postdoctoral Training Grant from the UCSF Cardiovascular Research Institute, and is currently a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Fellow of the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation.  Cryo-EM has undergone a  resolution revolution  that has enabled us to literally see TRP channels in all their glory,  said Julius.  We ve had some idea what TRPA1 might look like, but there s something elegant and satisfying about obtaining the structure, because seeing really is believing. ","Published: April 14, 2015"

With their delivery on the next SpaceX commercial resupply services mission this month, the Osteocytes and mechano-transduction (Osteo-4) investigation team will analyze the effects of microgravity on this type of bone cell. Understanding these effects will be critical as astronauts plan for future missions that require longer exposure to microgravity, such as to deep space or Mars. The results derived from this study could also have implications for patients on Earth in the treatment of bone disorders related to disuse or immobilization, as well as metabolic diseases such as osteoporosis.  We are investigating how osteocytes - the most abundant cells in the adult skeleton - both sense and respond to changes in mechanical forces, as achieved aboard the space station,  said National Institutes of Health (NIH) grantee Paola Divieti Pajevic, M.D., Ph.D., principal investigator of the Osteo-4 study and associate professor at the Goldman School of Dental Medicine at Boston University. Through previous spaceflight studies, some crew members have shown a loss of bone mass after long-duration missions in space. Divieti Pajevic s team examines the function and behavior of isolated osteocytes in microgravity to determine how they may contribute to the observed decline in crew member bone density. Osteocytes are the cells that sense mechanical forces, like weight-lifting, as they are applied to the skeleton. They transform these forces into biological responses, signaling other cells to make or remove bone.  If we can figure out bone loss in the extreme conditions of space, we could figure out how to make more bone or counteract bone loss in astronauts,  said Divieti Pajevic.  This has applications to millions of people on Earth who are affected by osteoporosis and related fractures.  Divieti Pajevic s research team uses samples from a specific line of bone cells from mice that mimic human bone osteocytes in gene expression. Gene expression is the process in which information programmed in a gene is used to direct the assembly of a protein molecule, which then helps carry out the instructions given to the cell for its role. The team will try to isolate the genetic signals changed in the cells once exposed to microgravity. During the Osteo-4 study, the osteocytes are grown in a synthetic, tissue-like, three-dimensional structure and housed inside bioreactors. Bioreactors are containers used to allow the cells to grow in a protected environment. Three trays each house three individual bioreactors, creating a total of nine samples for study on the space station. Once the samples have arrived in space and are exposed to microgravity, astronauts will freeze the cells at intervals of three, five and seven or eight days. Freezing the osteocytes will stop changes in the cells and allow the researchers to look at the differences at early and later stages of exposure to microgravity. The frozen samples will return to Earth aboard the SpaceX Dragon for further examination. The Osteo-4 study, sponsored by the NIH s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space and NASA s Kennedy Space Center, is Divieti Pajevic s first space station investigation. The project is funded under the Biomedical Research on the International Space Station (BioMed-ISS) initiative, a collaborative effort between NIH and NASA. Osteo-4 also represents the fourth mission for the Osteo series of investigations. Previously known as the Osteoporosis Experiment in Orbit, the research series began as a Canadian Space Agency project on Space Shuttle Discovery in 1998.  For us, the possibility to use the space station is really important to validate the ground-based model that we use in the lab,  said Divieti Pajevic.  We can envision doing multiple experiments, once we know how the cells behave in microgravity. Then we can try to find different pathways to manipulate the cells.  With this first osteocyte study in space, scientists may gain a better understanding of these plentiful bone cells  function. And with the orbiting laboratory planned for operations until at least 2024, this osteocyte project may be the beginning of what s to come.","Published: April 14, 2015"

The cultivation of organs and tissues from a patient s cells is the bleeding edge of medical research - regenerative methods can solve the problem of transplant rejection. However, it s quite a challenge to find a suitable frame, or substrate, to grow cells on. The material should be non-toxic and elastic and should not be rejected by the body or impede cell growth. A group of researchers led by Professor Konstantin Agladze, who heads the Laboratory of the Biophysics of Excitable Systems at MIPT, works on cardiac tissue engineering. The group has been cultivating fully functional cardiac tissues, able to contract and conduct excitation waves, from cells called cardiomyocytes. Previously, the group used synthetic polymeric nanofibers but recently decided to assay another material - electrospunfibers of spidroin, the cobweb protein. Cobweb strands are incredibly light and durable. They re five times stronger than steel, twice more elastic than nylon, and are capable of stretching a third of their length. The structure of spidroin molecules that make up cobweb drag lines is similar to that of the silk protein, fibroin, but is much more durable. Researchers would normally use artificial spidroin fiber matrices as a substrate to grow implants like bones, tendons and cartilages, as well as dressings. Professor Agladze s team decided to find out whether a spidroin substrate derived from genetically modified yeast cells can serve to grow cardiac cells. For this purpose, they seeded isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes on fiber matrices. During the experiment, the researchers monitored the growth of the cells and tested their contractibility and the ability to conduct electric impulses, which are the main features of normal cardiac tissue. The monitoring, carried out with the help of a microscope and fluorescent markers, showed that within three to five days a layer of cells formed on the substrate that were able to contract synchronously and conduct electrical impulses just like the tissue of a living heart would.  We can answer positively all questions we put at the beginning of this research project,  Professor Agladze says.

Few medical treatments show results as rapid and dramatic as those seen with DBS, in which surgically implanted devices deliver electrical pulses to inner brain structures involved in movement. In most Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who receive the treatment, symptoms of slow movement, tremor, and rigidity sharply diminish soon after the stimulation device is activated, and quickly return if the device is turned off. But surprisingly, there has been very little understanding of precisely why and how DBS works so well--a lack of knowledge that has held back efforts to further improve the therapy. Despite the great success of DBS, some significant problems remain. Customizing the stimulation delivered by DBS devices for each patient to maximally reduce symptoms is challenging and time-consuming. And a minority of patients never obtains the full benefit their physicians expect. With a better understanding of how DBS acts on brain circuits, researchers hope to address these shortcomings and make DBS an even more effective treatment. The new research, published online in Nature Neuroscience, reveals that DBS keeps PD symptoms in check by reducing excessive synchronization of brain activity in the motor cortex, a region on the outer surface of the brain that governs movements of the body. ""This therapy is becoming widespread for many brain disorders aside from movement disorders, including psychiatric conditions such as depression, but no one knows how it works,"" said UCSF's Philip Starr, MD, PhD, the Dolores Cakebread Chair in Neurological Surgery and senior author of the new study. ""This is a significant step in answering this question on the level of brain networks, not just addressing where you're actually applying the stimulation in the brain."" Previous research led by Coralie de Hemptinne, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Starr's laboratory, laid the groundwork for the new study. In 2013, de Hemptinne, Starr, and colleagues reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that a measure of synchronized rhythmic activity in the brain, which normally varies with movement or other behaviors, is excessively high in in the cortex in PD. In that paper, the team hypothesized that this lockstep synchronization of brain circuits in PD thwarts the flexibility the brain requires to plan and execute movements, and that DBS might work by decoupling activity patterns in the motor cortex. In the new work, ""since we had found this excessive synchrony in PD patients, we decided to see if there's a relationship between that synchrony and symptoms, and whether synchrony is lessened when symptoms are improved by DBS,"" said de Hemptinne, first author of the Nature Neuroscience paper. ""We measured synchrony in the motor area of the brain before, during, and after DBS, and while the patient was resting or engaged in a movement task in which they had to reach and touch a computer screen."" During surgery on 23 patients with Parkinson's disease in whom permanent DBS electrodes were being surgically implanted, the UCSF team slid a temporary strip of 6 recording electrodes under the skull and placed it over the motor cortex. As in the prior research, recordings of neural activity showed excessive synchronization of activity rhythms in the patients. As the name of the therapy implies, the end of the stimulating lead of DBS devices is placed in a structure deep in the brain known as the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which is part of a ""loop"" of neural circuitry that includes the motor cortex on the brain's surface. When the DBS device was activated and began stimulating the STN, the effect of the stimulation reached the motor cortex, where over-synchronization rapidly diminished. If the device was turned off, excessive synchrony re-emerged, more gradually in some patients than others. DBS surgery generally takes about six hours, and during the middle of the procedure patients are awakened for testing of the device and to ensure that the stimulating lead is properly placed in the STN. During this period the researchers asked 12 of the patients to perform a reaching task in which they had to touch a blue dot appearing on a computer screen. Importantly, said Starr, recordings revealed that DBS eliminated excessive synchrony of motor cortex activity and facilitated movement without altering normal changes in brain activity that accompany movements. ""Our 2013 paper showed how Parkinson's disease affects the motor cortex, and this paper shows how DBS affects the motor cortex,"" said Starr. ""With these two pieces of information in hand, we can begin to think of news ways for stimulators to be automatically controlled by brain activity, which is the next innovation in the treatment of movement disorders."" Because in these experiments the recording strip had to be removed before the end of surgery, recording data was collected over a relatively short time. To broaden opportunities for research, Starr and his team have collaborated with medical device company Medtronic on a new generation of permanently implantable DBS devices that can record activity in the motor cortex while delivering stimulation to the STN. Five UCSF patients have received with these new devices, and all data they collect can be uploaded for research during follow-up visits, de Hemptinne said, which will bring an even deeper understanding of how DBS reshapes brain activity. ""Now we can try to find even better correlations between DBS and symptoms, and we can even look at the effects of medications,"" said de Hemptinne. ""This new ability to collect data over a longer time course will be very powerful in driving new research.""

To avoid this, Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a software program that works seamlessly with currently available procedures to assist a surgeon's determination of which vertebra is which. Results from its first clinical evaluation show that the LevelCheck software achieves 100 percent accuracy in just 26 seconds. Details of the study appear in the April 15 issue of the journal Spine. ""Wrong-level spine surgery is never meant to happen,"" says Jeffrey Siewerdsen, Ph.D., a professor of biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins and a member of the Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality. ""But it happens nearly four times a week in the U.S."" Surgeons go to great lengths to get their procedures right, because mistakes are costly to patient health. They can result in pain, require follow-up surgeries, and create instability or degeneration of the spine, according to Jean-Paul Wolinsky, M.D., an associate professor of neurosurgery and oncology at Johns Hopkins and co-author of the study. Before a standard spinal operation, patients receive a diagnostic CT or MRI scan that the surgeon uses to plan the surgery. Once the patient is on the operating table, often days later, the surgeon typically counts down from the skull or up from the tailbone to determine which vertebra to operate on, often marking the patient's anatomy with thin metal pins. These pins are visible in an X-ray image taken in the operating room to verify the target site. But the doctor's initial planning on the preoperative scan is not visible in the X-ray image, leaving room for error, particularly when working on challenging cases exhibiting missing or extra vertebrae, a loss of anatomical landmarks from previous surgeries, or other anomalies. LevelCheck uses a standard desktop computer outfitted with a graphics processing unit, commonly used for video games, to align a patient's 3-D preoperative CT image with the 2-D X-ray image taken during surgery. The result is an X-ray image showing the pins that act as landmarks for the surgeon, overlaid with the planning information from the CT scan. ""LevelCheck does not replace the surgeon's expertise. It offers helpful guidance and decision support, like your GPS,"" says Siewerdsen. To test its accuracy, the team analyzed pre- and intraoperative images of 20 consecutive patients who had undergone spine surgery. By shifting the images, they simulated 10,000 surgeries and measured how long the software needed to correctly line up the images 100 percent of the time: only 26 seconds. ""This study is the first to demonstrate that LevelCheck works with real patient images,"" says Siewerdsen. ""It shows that the software can deal with challenges like changes in patient anatomy and the presence of surgical tools in the X-ray image."" Sheng-Fu Lo, M.D., evaluated the results to find what factors can cause the software to fail. ""The software doesn't always get it right if it is stopped early,"" says Lo, ""but given 26 seconds or more, LevelCheck found the right level every time."" ""We can't eliminate the possibility of wrong-level surgeries,"" says Wolinsky, ""but this is an additional level of security -- an independent check -- that works quickly within our standard surgical workflow. Although LevelCheck in its current form requires a preoperative CT scan for most patients, the benefit is well worth it."" In its early development, LevelCheck won an award from the North American Spine Society for Spine Technology of the Year. Work now underway by the research team includes a larger evaluation with images from 200 patients and testing in real time to measure its effects on time, workflow, accuracy and safety.

In new research published in the journal Brain, scientists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and in Germany and the USA show that the way in which the brain organizes its visual sense remains intact even in people who are blind from birth, and that at least the pattern of functional connectivity between the visual area and the topographical representation of space (up/down, left/right, etc.) can develop on its own without any actual visual experience. The findings dispel the nearly half-century belief that the visual cortex -- the area of the brain concerned with the sense of sight -- completely fails to develop properly in people who are blind at birth, suggesting it might not be completely correct. ""Though the 'blind brain' wiring may change greatly in the blind in its frontal language related parts, it still retains the most fundamental topographical and functional connectivity organizational principles of the visual cortex, known as 'retinotopic mapping' -- the processing of two-dimensional visual images through the eye,"" said co-lead researcher Amir Amedi, associate professor of medical neurobiology at the Hebrew University's Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences and IMRIC, the Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada. Operating within the Hebrew University's Faculty of Medicine, IMRIC coordinates research within the departmental areas of medical neurobiology, molecular genetics and biology, immunology and cancer research. The researchers found that the same ""mapping"" divisions-of-labor present in the normally sighted brain are also present in the brains of people born blind as reflected from their resting state connectivity patterns. This fundamental organization of the visual cortex was even found in people whose eyes did not develop normally, suggesting normal eye development may not be necessary for the establishment of large-scale functional connectivity network mapping in the most fundamental visual areas like V1, the primary visual cortex. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the latest findings reported by Prof. Amir Amedi, Dr. Ella Striem-Amit and Smadar Ovadia-Caro suggest that some key features and properties of visual cortex organization do not require visual experience to progress. The study further adds that the brain's visual cortex does not lose all of its properties even when completely deprived of vision. ""Some of the brain's connectivity maps is hardwired, possibly dependent on genetically-driven processes that do not need any external sensory information for their activation, while other process might indeed need visual input to specialize,"" Amedi said. The visual brain resting-state connectivity networks separated to up vs. down, right vs. left, front vs. back are also present in the brain of those born blind, according the study. Previous research by neurophysiologists David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, which earned them a Nobel Prize in 1981, suggested that sight restoration could not be attempted on people blind from birth. Therefore, they surmised, the blinded cortex could not enable the blind-from-birth to have sight. According to Hebrew University's Amedi, this latest research, combined with other research conducted in the Amedi Lab for Multisensory Research, ""means that it may be possible to successfully teach blind people to 'see with sounds and touch.'"" Using tools of sensory substitution, it may be possible to aid people born blind (or late blind) in a variety of new ways in the future, including restoring high-order functional pattern recognition for objects, localization, shape and even numbers and text, as previously reported in the prestigious journal Nature Communications (Abboud et al., Nature Comm., 2015).

The child was one of six cases in which TGen sequenced - or decoded - the genes of patients with Neuromuscular Disease (NMD) and was then able to identify the genetic source, or likely genetic source, of each child's symptoms, according to a study published April 8 in the journal Molecular Genetics & Genomic Medicine. ""In all six cases of myopathy, or muscle weakness, these children had undergone extensive, expensive and invasive testing - often over many years - without a successful diagnosis, until they enrolled in our study,"" said Dr. Lisa Baumbach-Reardon, an Associate Professor of TGen's Integrated Cancer Genomics Division and the study's senior author. This is a prime example of the type of ""personalized medicine"" TGen uses to zero in on diagnoses for patients, and to help their physicians find the best possible treatments.   ""Our results demonstrate the diagnostic value of a comprehensive approach to genetic sequencing,"" said Dr. Baumbach-Reardon. ""This type of next-generation sequencing can greatly improve the ability to identify pathogenic, or disease-causing, genetic variants with a single, timely, affordable test."" In one of the six cases, TGen researchers found a unique disease-causing variant, or mutation, in the CACNA1S gene for a child with severe muscle weakness in addition to ophthalmoplegia, or the inability to move his eyes. Properly functioning CACNA1S is essential for muscle movement. More specifically, CACNA1S senses electrical signals from the brain and enables muscles to contract. ""To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe congenital myopathy with ophthalmoplegia resulting from pathogenic variants in CACNA1S,"" said Dr. Jesse Hunter, a TGen Senior Post-Doctoral Fellow, and the study's lead author. Learning the specific genetic cause of symptoms is a key step in finding new therapeutic drugs that could treat the patient's disease. In another closely related case, TGen's genetic testing found a pathogenic variant in the RYR1 gene in a case of calcium channel myopathy. When the brain sends an electrical signal, CACNA1S opens the RYR1 calcium channel flooding muscles with calcium and causing them to contract. When either partner of this duo doesn't function correctly, devastating muscle weakness results. Five of the six cases involved patients under the care of Dr. Saunder Bernes, a neurologist at Barrow Neurological Institute at Phoenix Children's Hospital. Dr. Bernes referred all five cases to TGen for genetic sequencing in an effort to find the causes of the children's muscle weakness. A sixth patient, under the care of Dr. Judith Hall at the University of British Columbia, also underwent genetic sequencing at TGen. ""Without this type of deep genetic analysis, we might never have discovered the source of each of these children's disease,"" said Dr. Bernes, whose young patients' previous tests included muscle biopsies, EMG, MRI, EKG and limited gene sequencing. ""Now we are in a much better position to find new treatments for these and other children with similar symptoms."" In three of the six cases, the children had Collagen 6 myopathies, or weaknesses. Collagen is essential to holding together muscles, tendons, skin, cartilage and the disks between vertebras. In all three cases, TGen researchers identified a pathogenic variant, or disease-causing mutation, in the COL6A3 gene, or likely pathogenic variants in the COL6A6 gene. In still another case, TGen testing identified the genetic culprit of the child's muscle weakness as a pathogenic EMD variant associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. EDMD usually results in slowly progressive weakness and muscle wasting in the arms and legs, and causes contractures of the elbow, neck muscles, and the Achilles tendon. ""Reporting these cases raises awareness about how often each child with muscle disease is unique, requiring personalized medical treatment beginning with genetic diagnosis through sequencing like we perform at TGen."" Dr. Hunter said. ""This study provided answers to families with these difficult-to-treat and rare illnesses."" Genetic sequencing was performed at TGen's Collaborative Sequencing Center and confirmed in federal CLIA certified clinical laboratories. Also contributing to this study was Barrow Neurological Institute. Funding for this study - Novel pathogenic variants and genes for myopathies identified by whole exome sequencing - was provided by the Muscular Dystrophy Association (Grant #186435), the Flinn Foundation, the Helios Education Foundation, and the Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Foundation. This study will continue for the next three years through a grant from the Arizona Biomedical Research Commission. ","Published: April 13, 2015"

The findings, which could lead to a new class of cancer drugs, appear in the current issue of ACS Chemical Biology.  These are the first reported small-molecule HuR inhibitors that competitively disrupt HuR-RNA binding and release the RNA, thus blocking HuR function as a tumor-promoting protein,  said Liang Xu, associate professor of molecular biosciences and corresponding author of the paper. The results hold promise for treating a broad array of cancers in people. The researcher said HuR has been detected at high levels in almost every type of cancer tested, including cancers of the colon, prostate, breast, brain, ovaries, pancreas and lung.  HuR inhibitors may be useful for many types of cancer,  Xu said.  Since HuR is involved in many stem cell pathways, we expect HuR inhibitors will be active in inhibiting  cancer stem cells,  or the seeds of cancer, which have been a current focus in the cancer drug discovery field.  HuR has been studied for many years, but until now no direct HuR inhibitors have been discovered, according to Xu.  The initial compounds reported in this paper can be further optimized and developed as a whole new class of cancer therapy, especially for cancer stem cells,  he said.  The success of our study provides a first proof-of-principle that HuR is druggable, which opens a new door for cancer drug discovery. Many other RNA-binding proteins like HuR, which are so far undruggable, can also be tested for drug discovery using our strategy.  The research team evaluated about 6,000 compounds from both the KU Chemical Methodologies and Library Development Center and the Food and Drug Administration in a process known as  High Throughput Screening,  hunting for compounds that obstruct HuR s interface with healthy human RNA.  The KU researchers confirmed the potential of the most promising compounds with cutting-edge techniques like Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay, surface plasmon resonance, ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation assay and luciferase reporter functional studies   verifying that six compounds with a similar  scaffold  could be starting points of novel cancer drugs to target the oncoprotein HuR.   A cancer-causing gene, or oncogene, makes RNA, which then makes an oncoprotein that causes cancer or makes cancer cells hard to kill, or both,  Xu said.  This is the problem we re trying to overcome with precision medicine.  The scientist said the HuR-RNA binding site is like a long, narrow groove, not a well-defined pocket seen in other druggable proteins targeted by many current cancer therapies.  HuR tightly binds to RNA like a hand,  Xu said.  The HuR protein grabs the  rope    or the RNA   at a site called  ARE  on the rope. We aimed to find a small-molecule compound that makes the hand release the rope by competing with ARE of the RNA.  The research took more than 3 1/2 years and involved the collaboration of chemists, cancer biologists, computer modeling experts, biochemists and biophysicists at KU   notably the labs of Xu, Jeffrey Aub  in the Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Jon Tunge in the Department of Chemistry. Grants from the National Institutes of Health, along with funding from the state of Kansas, the Hall Family Foundation and Bold Aspiration funding from KU s Office of the Provost, supported the work. For Xu, the findings are reflective of a personal commitment to improving odds for people diagnosed with cancer, the second-largest killer in the U.S. after heart disease.  Trained as medical doctor and Ph.D., with both a grandfather and an uncle who died of cancer, I devoted my career to cancer research and drug discovery   aiming to translate discovery in the lab into clinical therapy, to help cancer patients and their families,  he said.  We hope to find a better therapy   and eventually a cure   for cancer.

This simple act could now save lives. A technology developed in part at EPFL can quickly identify the presence of a head and neck cancer, such as of the throat or mouth by analysing people's breath. The new device, equipped with extremely sensitive sensors, has been tested on patients and operates with a computer or even a mobile phone. It's an innovative tool for the early diagnosis of tumours. Very few routine exams exist to detect cancer. Yet this disease is the third leading cause of death worldwide. Most tumours are found relatively late, which makes recovery less likely. Cancer ""signals"" its presence in human breath At SAMLAB in Neuch tel, under the direction of Nico de Rooij, a team of researchers including Fr d ric Loizeau, a doctoral student at the time, developed very precise micro-sensors able to distinguish the breath of a healthy patient from that of a sick one. The scientists' starting point was the observation that human breath contains not only air, but also hundreds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose presence and concentration vary depending on the patients' state of health. The metabolism of cancerous cells is different from that of healthy cells, and the two types of cells produce different substances in terms of both quantity and typology. As a result, they leave their ""signature"" in people's breath.The researchers managed to detect these nuances with the aid of a network of micro-sensors. The technology called MSS was initially developed jointly by EPFL researcher and the late 1986 co-laureate of the Nobel price of physics, Heinrich Rohrer. Each sensor is composed of a silicon disk 500 micrometres in diameter that is covered by a polymer and suspended by four minuscule ""bridges"" with integrated piezoresistors. When exposed to a gas, the polymer absorbs certain molecules and the disk changes shape. This deformation is detected by the four piezoresistive bridges, which emit an electrical signal. This phenomenon makes it possible to determine the signature of the gas and its concentration. The trick lies in using different polymers on each sensor, in order to obtain an overview of the gas composition.  ""There are already methods for detecting molecules called  electronic noses' on the market. But they have a hard time analysing very complex gases like human breath,"" says Nico de Rooij. ""Humidity in particular can disrupt the reading, leading to false positives or false negatives."" With the new sensors, the detection process becomes extremely accurate. Clinical tests on healthy and sick patients With the collaboration of the Swiss Nanoscience Institute of the University of Basel, the EPFL researchers were able to test their device on actual patients from the University Hospital of Lausanne (Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois, CHUV) who were either sick or had undergone surgical treatment for head and neck cancer. The results of these tests showed that the sensors were incredibly effective. A Neuch tel-based company has already expressed interest in marketing this technology, which has been patented. Breathe into your smartphone But the story doesn't end there for the sensors, which have numerous applications. Recently, the NIMS/MANA research centre in Japan, another partner in the project, connected the sensors to mobile phones. This innovation earned them an award at the Nanotech 2015 event. This technology is also of interest to biologists. At the University of Neuch tel, tests are currently being run by the Laboratoire pour la recherche fondamentale et appliqu e en  cologie chimique in order to analyse the gases given off by plants when they are attacked by certain insects or mushrooms. These gases serve to attract other insects that will protect the plant. The ability to detect this phenomenon early on could allow farmers to react more quickly to an attack and, as a result, use less insecticide.","Published: April 13, 2015"

Integral membrane proteins also are notoriously hard to synthesize and study, which explains why so few have been fully, three-dimensionally characterized with protein crystallography. Using standard recombinant DNA techniques and some novel design principles, Cornell chemical engineers have developed a new method for making large quantities of integral membrane proteins simply and inexpensively - all without the use of harsh chemicals, or detergents, typically used today. The method, which they call  SIMPLEx  (Solubilization of Integral Membrane Proteins with high Levels of Expression), could lead to increased characterization and understanding of this all-important class of proteins, and also could be used to make protein machinery for synthetic biological processes. Published online April 8 in Nature Communications, the work was led by Matthew DeLisa, the William L. Lewis Professor of Engineering in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, with first author and postdoctoral associate Dario Mizrachi, who designed and carried out the experiments. Most known protein structures live inside the cell and are water soluble - happy in the cytoplasmic aqueous environment. But membrane proteins are hydrophobic - they hate water - which is why they re happiest when embedded in the waterproof lipid bilayer of a cell. Soluble proteins are much easier to make in sufficient quantities for characterization and study. Making enough membrane proteins to study involves a method called detergent extraction, which employs a chemical to strip the protein from its natural lipid membrane. While this process has been improved in recent years, DeLisa says, it creates a bottleneck because each protein may require a different detergent, and the technique can ruin the protein s biological functionality. For their SIMPLEx method, the engineers used recombinant DNA techniques to stitch together an artificial membrane protein with an identity crisis - one that maintains its biological function, but thinks it s soluble in water. Using E. coli as their host cells, they modified one end of their desired membrane protein with a decoy protein that tricks the E. coli into expressing the membrane protein in the cytoplasm instead of in the lipid membrane. At the other end, they attached what s called an amphipathic protein, which has both a hydrophilic and hydrophobic end, as a shield that protects the membrane protein from water - an effective substitute for the normal role of the lipid membrane. The technique so far appears to be applicable to a wide range of membrane proteins from all domains of life. The researchers hope to continue experimenting with it not only to fully characterize more membrane protein structures, but also to engineer proteins used in biological pathways like glycosylation, which is the ubiquitous life process of attaching sugar molecules to proteins. This is one of DeLisa s main research interests. The paper, titled  Making water-soluble integral membrane proteins in vivo using an amphipathic protein fusion strategy,  included co-author Lois Pollack, professor of applied and engineering physics, whose lab provided small-angle X-ray scattering characterization of the chimeric protein structures, performed at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. The work was supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.","Published: April 11, 2015"

People with PTSD have been in a situation in which they were at risk of death, serious injury or sexual violence or have seen first-hand loved ones faces such threats. They may experience flashbacks, emotional detachment and jumpiness, among other symptoms that affect their ability to function in everyday life. Currently, the only approved therapy for PTSD is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as Zoloft and Paxil, but their effectiveness is marginal. Now researchers at Louisiana State University have found that a readily available superfood-the blueberry-could be an effective treatment. Philip J. Ebenezer presents  The Neuro-Protective Efficacy of Blueberry in an Animal Model of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)  in a poster session on Monday, March 30, at the Experimental Biology meeting (Boston Convention and Exhibition Center from 12:45 to 3 P.M. EDT). Ebenezer et al. have previously demonstrated that SSRIs increase levels of serotonin (5-HT) and the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) and that the increased NE may reduce the effectiveness of SSRI therapy. In the new study, the research team looked at the ability of blueberries to modulate neurotransmitter levels in a rat model of PTSD. Researchers supplemented some of the rats with a blueberry-enriched (2 percent) diet and others with a control diet. A third control group did not have PTSD and received a standard diet (without blueberries). They found that PTSD rats who did not receive blueberries demonstrated a predictable increase in NE and 5-HT when compared with the control group. However, the PTSD rats that received blueberries showed a beneficial increase in 5-HT with no effect on NE levels, suggesting that blueberries can effectively modulate neurotransmitters in PTSD. Full AbstractPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma and stressor-related disorder that results in a prolonged stress response. It is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC). Previous findings from our lab indicate that neurotransmitter levels are modulated in the brain of PTSD animals. The only approved therapy for PTSD is the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), but their efficacy is marginal. Recently, we demonstrated that over-activation of norepinephrine (NE) along with serotonin (5-HT) as the possible reason for the lack of efficacy of SSRI. Hence, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of PTSD. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective role of blueberries (BB) in modulating neurotransmitter levels in PTSD. Rats were fed with a blueberry-enriched (2 percent) or a control diet. Rats were exposed to cats for one hour on days 1 and 11 of a 31-day schedule to simulate traumatic conditions. At the end of the study, the rats were euthanized and PFC and HC were isolated. We measured monoamines and their metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography. In our PTSD model, NE levels were increased and 5-HT levels were decreased when compared to control. In contrast, a BB diet increased 5-HT without affecting NE levels. These findings indicate non-pharmacological approaches might modulate neurotransmitters in PTSD. Further studies to understand the molecular mechanism of neuro-protection by BB can provide a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PTSD.","Published: April 11, 2015"

Archaeologists have long suspected that our Palaeolithic ancestors used plant poisons to make their hunting weapons more lethal. Now Dr Valentina Borgia has teamed up with a forensic chemist to develop a technique for detecting residues of deadly substances on archaeological objects. We re surrounded by poisonous plants: they thrive in our parks and gardens, hedgerows and woodlands. Foxgloves (Digitalis) look charming but their seeds can kill. The flowers of monkshood (Aconitum napellus) are a stunning blue but its roots can be deadly. Hemlock (Conium maculatum) is both common and extremely toxic as Shakespeare reminds us in Macbeth with the incantations of the witches. Archaeologists have long believed that our ancestors used poisons extracted from such plants to make their weapons more lethal and kill their prey more swiftly. By dipping an arrow head into a poisonous paste, the hunter could ensure that an animal would receive a dose of toxic chemicals - alkaloids or cardenolides - that would either kill it immediately or slow it down. Until very recently it has been impossible to prove that poisons extracted from plants were used by early societies. Now Dr Valentina Borgia, a specialist in Palaeolithic hunting weapons and Marie Curie Fellow at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, believes that she is on the brink of being able to prove that our ancestors used poisons as far back as 30,000 years ago. Borgia has approached the likely use of poisons by our distant ancestors from a number of viewpoints. Her research looks at the ubiquity of poisonous plants in many local environments and their use both historically and by modern hunter-gatherers. Working with a forensic chemist she has also developed techniques capable of detecting tiny residues of poison on archaeological objects. She is now putting those techniques to the test with samples obtained from museum collections.  We know that the Babylonians, Greeks and Romans used plant-based poisons both for hunting animals and in war. In fact, the word  toxic  come from toxon, the Greek for bow. Taxus is a genus of the yew tree with a springy timber traditionally used to make bows. It also produces seeds used to poison arrows. In Britain, yews grown for their timber were planted in churchyards so that animals wouldn t be poisoned by eating their berries,  says Borgia.  Few hunter-gatherer societies remain today but all the groups that have survived employ poisons. The Yanomami people of the Amazonian rainforest use curare - a mix of Strychnos genus plants - to poison their arrows. In Africa, a variety of different plants are used to make poisons. Acokanthera, Strophantus and Strychnos are the most common.  Many Northern Asian populations used monkshood (Aconitum) to kill large animals such as bear and Siberian ibex. Poisonous plants also feature in folklore. In Malaysia, darts are poisoned using Antiaris toxicaria, a poison that comes from the Upas tree. A Malaysian legend says:  Seven up, eight down and nine no life . The victim takes seven steps uphill, eight steps downhill and a ninth final step. In 2014, Borgia enlisted the expertise of forensic chemist Michelle Carlin (Northumbria University) to help her devise a method for identifying residues of poison. Carlin s day-to-day work is focused on crime and the detection of illegal substances through chemical analysis. Using a highly specialist technique called liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, she is able to detect invisible traces of drugs   such as cocaine in pocket linings. The same technique can be used to detect the presence of poisons used thousands of years ago. Together Borgia and Carlin have created a database listing toxic plants and have developed a non-destructive method of collecting samples of residues from archaeological materials, by simply touching the item with cotton imbued with pure water. Samples of poisonous plants were supplied to the researchers by the Botanic Garden at the University of Cambridge and Alnwick Castle in Northumberland. Alnwick has a Poison Garden where visitors can see 150 poisonous plants. Some (such as monkshood) are so toxic that Alnwick has to obtain a licence from the Home Office in order to cultivate them. Another route to identification of plant residues is to look for the presence of starches which remain on the surface of the prehistoric weapons. Starch grains can be used to determine plant taxa: each species has distinctive size, shape and structure. Borgia has collaborated with a major expert in this methodology, Dr Huw Barton (University of Leicester) in order to use starching testing as one of her research tools. Many museums with ethnographical collections have poisoned weapons in their displays and stores. Borgia has been able to collect samples from objects held by the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge, the Pitts Rivers Museum in Oxford and the Museo Etnografico Pigorini of Roma (Italy) with the collaboration of her Italian colleague, Dr Jacopo Crezzini. The objects include a Chinese pot with Aconite poison inside (wrapped in a newspaper dated 13 July 1926), Malaysian darts poisoned with Upas, various African arrows and a glass tube containing curare.  The wonderful craftsmanship used to create objects so strongly associated with poison is also significant. As the French philosopher Simondon says, there is no pure technical device free from symbolic meaning,  says Borgia.  These artefacts fully express this concept, as they show a high degree of care. A scary-looking Borneo harpoon, wonderfully carved, in the Cambridge museum is thought to have been made from a human bone. A card, conserved with it, warns  Care. Has been poisoned .  Carlin s analysis of these samples of materials has shown that residues of poisons are easily detectable on the objects a century later and that the residues retained their chemical characteristics. Now the real challenge for the researchers is to go much further back in time. Testing of a sample of six stone-tipped pre-dynastic Egyptian arrows, dating from 4,000 years BC and conserved in the Phoebe A Hearst Museum of Berkeley (USA), is now taking place. At the time these arrows where first studied, 40 years ago, the researchers removed small portions of the black residue present on the tips, and injected into a cat. The reaction of the poor animal (which did survive) was evidence of the presence of a poison on the arrows.  Nowadays we have the right instruments to get more information without cruelty to animals. Initial tests strongly suggest the presence of Acokanthera, a poisonous plant on our database, but we can t be completely certain as there are a number of components in the compound,  said Borgia.  It made good sense for people to use poisons. On their own, Palaeolithic weapons with stone arrowheads may not have been deadly enough to immobilize or kill a large animal such as a red deer. Poisons plants were plentiful and the Prehistoric population knew the environment where they lived, they knew the edible plants and their potential as medicines and poisons. To fabricate a poison is easy and economic, and the risk is minimal. In addition, the making of poisons is often part of the tradition and the rituality of hunting.  When archaeologists remove items from the ground in the course of field work, they brush off the soil adhering to the finds and sometimes even wash objects. Borgia is appealing to fellow archaeologists to contact her when they find weapons and not to clean up their finds.  Now we have this technique available, and have shown that it works, we need to test it as much as possible on archaeological samples,  she says. Borgia denies that her family name (Lucrezia Borgia is legendary as a devious poisoner) prompted her interest in poisons but she delights in the Latin quip  nomen omen . It translates roughly as  significant name  and certainly the name Borgia has powerful historic resonances. Luckily for Borgia s colleagues, her objectives are honourable and entirely academic. She says:  Investigation of the use of poisons in Prehistoric periods adds to our understanding of hunting techniques and rituals, and also how the plant world was exploited. The Renaissance physician Paracelsus wrote that dosis facit venenum (the dose makes the poison). Ethnographic studies tell us that the most common toxic plants used in poisons were also used to treat diseases. Not surprisingly, the same substances are the basis for many medications still in use today. ","Published: April 11, 2015"

Geomagnetic visual prosthesis helps blind rats find their way Navigating a complex environment requires an egocentric representation: a neural signature of how you and your body relate to objects in your visual field. Part of the difficulty in exploring space for those without sight is the challenge of understanding how object positions relate to each other (allocentric representation) and to oneself (egocentric representation). Understanding how the brain encodes this activity is therefore a key step forward in understanding the neurobiology of vision, leading to possible treatments for blindness.   Autism's early neuronal 'neighborhood' In early childhood, the neurons inside children's developing brains form connections between various regions of brain ""real estate."" As described in a paper published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, cognitive neuroscientists at San Diego State University found that in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, the connections between the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum appear to be overdeveloped in sensorimotor regions of the brain. This overdevelopment appears to muscle in on brain ""real estate"" that in typically developing children is more densely occupied by connections that serve higher cognitive functioning.   Novel therapeutic procedure helps stroke patient recover three-dimensional vision Impaired vision is one of the most common consequences of a stroke. In rare cases, patients may even lose their ability to perceive depth. Such patients see the world around them as flat, like a two-dimensional picture. This makes it impossible for them to judge distances accurately   a skill they need, for instance, when reaching for a cup or when a car is approaching them on the street. A patient with this particular type of visual dysfunction has recently been studied in detail by the research team at Saarland University in collaboration with colleagues at the Charit  university hospital in Berlin. The team has developed the first effective treatment regime and have identified the area of the brain that, when damaged, may cause loss of binocular depth perception.   Promising drug discovery for the effects of Alzheimer s disease Scientists from the University of South Australia, along with colleagues from Third Military Medical University in Chongqing, China, have discovered the drug Edaravone can alleviate the progressive cognitive deficits of Alzheimer's disease, a major social and economic burden worldwide. The discovery has been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  Children with autism can learn to be social, trial shows When Debra Kamps, senior scientist at the University of Kansas (KU) Life Span Institute, first began researching how to improve the social and communication skills of children with autism in natural settings like schools in the 1970s, it was hard to find children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) who were in classrooms with their typically developing peers.Today, Kamps and her colleagues from KU and the University of Washington can say with certainty that they know how teachers, speech therapists and others can teach social and communication skills to kids with ASD and their peers in the classroom, at lunch and even at recess after the results of the first large randomized study of a social communication intervention verified years of earlier research.","Published: April 10, 2015"

The team, led by Michael Lutter, MD, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry in the UI Carver College of Medicine, found that mice that lack the estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA) gene are less motivated to seek out high-fat food when they are hungry and have abnormal social interactions. The effect was stronger in female mice, which also showed increased obsessive-compulsive-like behaviors. The study also shows that ESRRA levels are controlled by energy status in the mice. Restricting calorie intake to 60 percent of normal over several days significantly increased levels of ESRRA in the brains of normal mice. ""Decreased calorie intake usually motivates animals, including humans, to seek out high-calorie food. These findings suggest that loss of ESRRA activity may disrupt that response,"" Lutter says. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are common and severe mental illnesses. Lutter notes that although 50 to 70 percent of the risk of getting an eating disorder is inherited, identifying the genes that mediate this risk has proven difficult. ESRRA is a transcription factor - a gene that turns on other genes. Lutter and his colleagues previously found that a mutation that reduces ESRRA activity is associated with an increased risk for eating disorders in human patients. Although ESRRA is expressed in many brain regions that are disrupted in anorexia, almost nothing was known about its function in the brain. In the new study, published online April 9 in the journal Cell Reports, Lutter's team manipulated ESRRA in mice to investigate the gene's role in behavior. ""This work identifies estrogen-related receptor alpha as one of the genes that is likely to contribute to the risk of getting anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa,"" Lutter says. ""Clearly social factors, particularly the western ideal of thinness, contribute the remaining  non-genetic  risk, and the increasing rate of eating disorders over the past several decades is likely due to social factors, not genetics,"" he adds. Through a series of experiments with genetically engineered mice, Lutter and his team showed that mice without the ESRRA gene have behavioral abnormalities related to eating and social behavior. In particular, mice without ESRRA show reduced effort to work for high-fat food when they are hungry. The mice also exhibited impaired social interaction and female mice without the gene show increased compulsive grooming, which may mimic obsessive-compulsive-type behavior in humans. In order to refine their understanding of the effects of ESRRA in the brain, the researchers selectively removed the gene from particular brain regions that have been associated with eating disorders. They found that removing the gene from the orbitofrontal cortex was associated with increased obsessive-compulsive-type behaviors in female mice, while loss of ESRRA from the prefrontal cortex produced mice that were less willing to work to get high-fat food when they were hungry. These new findings may point to particular neural circuits that could be targets to treat abnormal behaviors associated with eating disorders. ""Mouse models of human neuropsychiatric illnesses are useful for identifying cellular and molecular abnormalities that might contribute to illnesses like eating disorders,"" Lutter says. ""They are also useful for screening new medications. We plan to start testing novel treatments for anorexia nervosa to see if they reverse behavioral problems in our mice.""

It had been thought that giving the drug to people with signs of early brain damage caused by a stroke would increase the chances of them suffering a bleed - which can be fatal. The study is the first to show that early tissue damage seen in brain scans does not necessarily indicate an increased risk of bleeding. Patients with early tissue damage from strokes are less likely to make a full recovery, but still benefit from receiving the drug. The drug - called alteplase - is the only treatment for stroke caused by a blocked blood vessel in the brain. Worries over the appearance of brain scans have probably meant patients who could have benefited from alteplase did not receive it. Experts were concerned that patients with early brain tissue damage - which can be difficult for doctors to see - were more likely to suffer a bleed if they were treated with alteplase. Researchers found there is only an increased risk of bleeds in patients with multiple signs of tissue damage caused by other diseases and signs of a fresh blood clot. In the small number of people with old tissue damage and a new blood clot, 14 per cent of those given alteplase are likely to have a hemorrhage. In people without these signs, three per cent are expected to suffer a bleed if they are given the drug. Researchers analyzed more than 3,000 people involved in a clinical trial assessing the effectiveness of alteplase as a stroke treatment. Patient risk factors are easy to identify in brain scans, enabling doctors to decide whether the risk to patients outweighs the potential benefits of receiving alteplase.

The findings, which come from the largest ever study to examine the statistical association between BMI and dementia risk, also show that middle-aged obese people (BMI greater than 30 kg/m2) are nearly 30% less likely to develop dementia than people of a healthy weight, contradicting findings from some previous research, which suggested that obesity leads to an increased risk of dementia. Researchers based at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and OXON Epidemiology, both in London, UK, analyzed data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a large database of patient information recorded during routine general practice over nearly 20 years, representing around 9% of the UK population.  The researchers analyzed the medical records of nearly two million (1,958,191) people with an average (median) age of 55 years at the start of the study period, and an average (median) BMI of 26.5 kg/m2, just within the range usually classed as overweight.  During an average (median) of nine years follow-up, nearly fifty thousand (45,507) people were diagnosed with dementia. People who were underweight in middle age were a third (34%) more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than those of a healthy weight, and this increased risk of dementia persisted even 15 years after the underweight was recorded. As participants  BMI at middle age increased, the risk of dementia reduced, with very obese people (BMI greater than 40 kg/m2) 29% less likely to get dementia than people in the normal weight range.  An increase in BMI was associated with a substantial steadily decreasing risk of dementia for BMI of up to 25 kg/m  (classed as a healthy weight).  Above a BMI of 25 kg/m  (classed as overweight or obese), dementia risk decreased more gradually, and this trend continued up to a BMI of 35 kg/m  or higher. The association between BMI and dementia risk wasn t affected by the decade in which the participants were born, nor by their age at diagnosis. Adjusting for confounding factors known to increase the risk of dementia, such as alcohol use or smoking, made little difference to the results. According to study author Professor Stuart Pocock from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,  Our results suggest that doctors, public health scientists, and policy makers need to re-think how to best identify who is at high risk of dementia.  We also need to pay attention to the causes and public health consequences of the link between underweight and increased dementia risk which our research has established.  However, our results also open up an intriguing new avenue in the search for protective factors for dementia   if we can understand why people with a high BMI have a reduced risk of dementia, it s possible that further down the line, researchers might be able to use these insights to develop new treatments for dementia.   The reasons why a high BMI might be associated with a reduced risk of dementia aren t clear, and further work is needed to understand why this might be the case,  adds Dr Nawab Qizilbash from OXON Epidemiology in London, UK and Madrid, Spain, the study s lead author.   If increased weight in mid-life is protective against dementia, the reasons for this inverse association are unclear at present. Many different issues related to diet, exercise, frailty, genetic factors, and weight change could play a part.  Writing in a linked Comment, Professor Deborah Gustafson from SUNY Downstate Medical Center in New York, USA, says,  The published literature about BMI and dementia is equivocal. Some studies report a positive association between high mid-life BMI and dementia, whereas others do not  Many considerations are needed in the assessment of the epidemiology of the association between BMI and late-onset dementia, as is the case for many recorded associations involving late-life disorders. To understand the association between BMI and late-onset dementia should sober us as to the complexity of identifying risk and protective factors for dementia.

The research, a collaboration of hundreds of research institutions led by The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The University of Cambridge, showed that a test for differences in 77 separate letters of DNA code could indicate a woman s risk of developing breast cancer.  The study, the most definitive of its type conducted so far, was funded by a range of organisations including Cancer Research UK and Breakthrough Breast Cancer, and was published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.  The researchers came up with a  score  for each woman based on the letters they had in each of the 77 positions of their DNA code, using one of the world s biggest databases of genetic information   called the Collaborative Oncological Gene-Environment Study (COGS).  They found a significant link between the score   called a  polygenic risk score    and a woman s breast cancer risk. For example, a woman in the top 20 per cent for polygenic risk score was 1.8 times more likely to develop breast cancer than the average woman.  A woman in the top 1 per cent for the polygenic risk score was more than three times more likely to develop breast cancer than average   corresponding to a risk for these women of around one in three.  The researchers also delved into a range of other elements of each woman s cancer   such as its type, and the age it was diagnosed. The genetic score was particularly good at predicting risk in women who developed oestrogen receptor positive disease, the type of disease most responsive to hormonal treatments like tamoxifen.  Analysing this panel of 77 genetic markers   all of which had previously been linked with slight increases in breast cancer risk on their own   was much more accurate in defining risk than previous tests that used fewer markers.  Importantly, the study also suggests that using this genetic testing alongside current measures would make current risk screening methods more accurate. For example, the researchers showed that the risk score could predict breast cancer risk both in women with and without a family history of the disease.  Lifetime risk of breast cancer for women with a history of breast cancer in their close family was 24.4 per cent if they were in the highest-scoring fifth   compared with 8.6 per cent if they were in the lowest fifth.  But for women without a history of breast cancer in their close family, the risks were 16.6 and 5.2 per cent respectively.  Study co-leader Professor Montserrat Garcia-Closas, Professor of Epidemiology at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said:  Our study is the most definitive so far to show the clear benefits of using genetic testing for a large number of genetic risk factors in identifying women at elevated risk of developing breast cancer. This type of testing could fit alongside other standard risk measures, such as family history and body mass index, to improve our ability to target the best preventive treatments and advice to those women most likely to benefit from them.   It s now important to work out how this sort of test could be used widely in a healthcare, rather than in a research setting. Currently available tests can analyse a handful of high-risk genes, but outside of looking for changes to these genes in women with a history of breast cancer in their close family, genetic testing is not widely offered to women.  Study co-leader Professor Douglas Easton, Director of the Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology at the University of Cambridge, said:  Breast cancer genes are rarely out of the news, but we ve now reached a crucial stage at which all this research can be combined to help target screening and advice to those women who need them the most. There s still work to be done to determine how tests like this could complement other risk factors, such as age, lifestyle and family history, but it s a major step in the right direction that will hopefully see genetic risk prediction become part of routine breast screening in the years to come.  Nell Barrie, Senior Science Communications Manager at Cancer Research UK, said:  This study shows how the genetic map of breast cancer that scientists have been building up over the years might be used to identify women most at risk, so we can take steps to reduce their chances of developing the disease or catch it at the earliest possible stage.  Dr Matthew Lam, Senior Research Officer at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said:  In recent years we ve learnt so much about genetic risk factors of breast cancer   in fact Breakthrough researchers had a hand in discovering over 60 of the genetic markers associated with the disease. What s great to see now is that these findings are starting to be translated into practical methods to predict risk on an individual basis. ","Published: April 10, 2015"

The broccoli variety was bred to contain two to three times more of a naturally occurring compound glucoraphanin. It is now available in supermarkets, under the name Benefort . Working with colleagues at the University of Reading, in two independent studies, the researchers gave a total of 130 volunteers 400g of the high glucoraphanin broccoli per week to include in their normal diet. After 12 weeks, they saw the levels of LDL-cholesterol in their blood drop by an average of about 6%. Elevated LDL cholesterol is a recognised risk factor for heart disease. Although the reduction seen in these trials is small, at a population level, a 1% reduction in LDL-cholesterol has been associated with a 1-2% reduction in risk of coronary artery disease. Glucoraphanin is thought to work by helping our bodies retune cellular metabolism. Mitochondria, the energy centres of the cell, convert sugars and fats into energy. But if they aren t working efficiently, or if we overload them with too much fat or sugar, one response is to channel excess into cholesterol. Glucoraphanin is converted in the body to sulphoraphane, which turns on specific genes that activate our bodies  defences against this happening, rebalancing metabolism away from the production of LDL cholesterol. This new study, published in the journal Molecular Nutrition and Food Research, provides the evidence for this reduction. High glucoraphanin Benefort  broccoli was developed using traditional breeding techniques at IFR s partners on the Norwich Research Park, the John Innes Centre and the University of East Anglia, and Seminis Vegetable Seeds Inc. This study was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), Innovate UK and Seminis Vegetable Seeds Inc. Other foods or ingredients that have been proven to lower LDL-cholesterol are beta-glucans in oats and plant stanols. These work by reducing cholesterol absorption into the body. As glucoraphanin works by reducing how much our bodies make, eating these foods together is likely to have an additive effect.","Published: April 10, 2015"

The collaboration will use Singulex s proprietary Erenna  Immunoassay System to develop biomarkers to further Huntington s disease research. An article published online April 7th in the Journal of Clinical Investigation (JCI) outlines research from an international team of scientists who developed a new ultra-sensitive assay using the Singulex SMCTM Technology Erenna Immunoassay system that is able to detect mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of HD patients, including some who carry the HD mutation but have not yet developed symptoms. The Singulex assay combines fluorescent antibodies with a laser detection chamber to count individual molecules of mHTT with a very low detection threshold, including both high specificity for mHTT and sensitivity to the femtomolar level.  This research demonstrates the value of our SMC technology and its ability to measure previously undetectable levels of potential biomarkers, providing new insights into disease,  said Paul Wheeler, PhD, Vice President of Life Science Sales and Marketing at Singulex.  We are hopeful that this initial research and our further collaboration with CHDI will lead to the discovery of accepted biomarkers for use in the development and testing of new potential therapies for Huntington s disease.  In addition to detecting the protein in CSF for the first time, the researchers found that the level of mHTT was higher in people with more advanced disease. Additionally, the concentration of mHTT predicted the severity of movement and cognitive problems in patients.  Quantifying disease-specific proteins in cerebrospinal fluid has been critical to the study and treatment of other neurodegenerative disorders, but until now mutant huntingtin protein has never been measured in CSF since it is present at such very low levels,  said Douglas Macdonald, PhD, Director of Drug Discovery and Development at CHDI.  With this new assay we hope that mutant huntingtin will prove to be a useful biomarker for the upcoming trials of huntingtin-lowering therapeutics. ","Published: April 10, 2015"

This pathway, which was discovered less than a decade ago, appears to regulate processes that are closely linked to an increasing number of cancers,  Kissil said.  The more we study it, the more we see its involvement. This new grant will help expand our investigation.  The Hippo-YAP signaling pathway has been found active in breast, colorectal and liver cancers, in hepatocellular and squamous cell carcinoma, and in melanoma of the eye. Cancers initiated through this pathway tend to thrive and proliferate, relatively immune to destruction from programmed cell death. Kissil, Scampavia and their colleagues plan to use Scripps Florida s ultra-high-throughput screening resources and the campus s library of more than 600,000 compounds to develop a series of screens to identify and optimize compounds to target the pathway and combat cancer.

While mountain gorillas are extensively inbred and at risk of extinction, research published in Science finds more to be optimistic about in their genomes than expected. ""Mountain gorillas are among the most intensively studied primates in the wild, but this is the first in-depth, whole-genome analysis,"" says Dr Chris Tyler-Smith, corresponding author from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. ""Three years on from sequencing the gorilla reference genome, we can now compare the genomes of all gorilla populations, including the critically endangered mountain gorilla, and begin to understand their similarities and differences, and the genetic impact of inbreeding."" The number of mountain gorillas living in the Virunga volcanic mountain range on the borders of Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo plummeted to approximately 253 in 1981 as a result of habitat destruction and hunting. Since then, conservation efforts led by the Rwanda Development Board and conservation organizations like the Gorilla Doctors (a partnership between the non-profit Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project and the UC Davis Wildlife Health Center), and supported by tourists keen to see the gorillas made famous by late primatologist Dian Fossey, have bolstered numbers to approximately 480 among the Virunga population. Researchers interested to learn how such a small gene pool would affect the mountain gorillas were surprised to find that many harmful genetic variations had been removed from the population through inbreeding, and that mountain gorillas are genetically adapting to surviving in small populations. ""This new understanding of genetic diversity and demographic history among gorilla populations provides us with valuable insight into how apes and humans, their closely related cousins, adapt genetically to living in small populations,"" says Dr Aylwyn Scally, corresponding author from the Department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge. ""In these data we can observe the process by which genomes are purged of severely deleterious mutations by a small population size."" Using blood samples collected over several years by the Rwanda Development Board, The Institut Congolese pour la Conservation du Nature and by Gorilla Doctors, which treats wild gorillas injured by snares, researchers were able to sequence the whole genomes of seven mountain gorillas for the first time. Previously, only easily obtainable but poor-quality DNA from faecal and hair samples have been analysed at a handful of genetic loci. Scientists could now see that these mountain gorillas, along with eastern lowland gorillas, their closely related neighbours, were two to three times less genetically diverse than gorillas from larger groups in western regions of central Africa. While there are concerns that this low level of genetic diversity may make the mountain gorillas more vulnerable to environmental change and to disease, including cross-infectious strains of human viruses, the inbreeding has, in some ways, been genetically beneficial. Fewer harmful loss-of-function variants were found in the mountain gorilla population than in the more numerous western gorilla populations. These variants stop genes from working and can cause serious, often fatal, health conditions. By analysing the variations in each genome, researchers also discovered that mountain gorillas have survived in small numbers for thousands of years. Using recently-developed methods, researchers were able to determine how the size of the population has changed over the past million years. According to their calculations, the average population of mountain gorillas has numbered in the hundreds for many thousands of years; far longer than previously thought. ""We worried that the dramatic decline in the 1980s would be catastrophic for mountain gorillas in the long term, but our genetic analyses suggest that gorillas have been coping with small population sizes for thousands of years,"" says Dr Yali Xue, first author from the Sanger Institute. ""While comparable levels of inbreeding contributed to the extinction of our relatives the Neanderthals, mountain gorillas may be more resilient. There is no reason why they should not flourish for thousands of years to come."" It is hoped that the detailed, whole-genome sequence data gathered through this research will aid conservation efforts. Now that a genome-wide map of genetic differences between populations is available, it will be possible to identify the origins of gorillas that have been illegally captured or killed. This will enable more gorillas to be returned to the wild and will make it easier to bring prosecutions against those who poach gorillas for souvenirs and bush meat. ""Our dedicated programme of clinical monitoring and intervention in cooperation with the Rwanda Development Board, the Institut Congolese pour la Conservation du Nature and local communities is helping to ensure the health and sustainability of endangered mountain gorillas,"" says Dr Mike Cranfield, Co-Director of Gorilla Doctors, ""Detailed genetic data help us trace where confiscated gorillas came from, and allows the assessment of the genetic health of the population as well as their susceptibility to certain health issues.""

The awardee institutions will develop tools to identify certain pathogens that frequently cause infections in health care settings and, specifically, those that are resistant to most antimicrobials. Advancing the development of rapid and innovative diagnostic tests for identifying and characterizing resistant bacteria is a key goal of the President s recent National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (PDF - 442KB) External Web Site Policy. Antimicrobials have been used to successfully treat patients for more than 70 years, but the drugs have become less effective as organisms adapt to the drugs designed to kill them. Each year in the United States, more than 2 million people develop antibiotic-resistant infections and at least 23,000 people die as a result, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Antibiotic-resistant infections also contribute to rising health care costs due to the need for more expensive treatments and prolonged hospital stays.  Antimicrobial resistance is a serious global health threat that is undermining our ability to effectively detect, treat and prevent infections,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  One way we can combat drug resistance is by developing enhanced diagnostic tests that rapidly identify the bacteria causing an infection and their susceptibility to various antimicrobials. This will help physicians determine the most effective treatments for infected individuals and thereby reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that can contribute to the drug resistance problem.  Each of the institutions receiving the NIAID awards will develop a diagnostic tool that identifies and provides corresponding antibiotic susceptibility information for one or more of the following bacteria: Klebsiella pneumonia; Acinetobacter baumannii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Enterobacter species; and Escherichia coli. The current process for diagnosing some bacterial infections can take up to three days and requires patient samples to be sent to labs where the suspected bacteria is cultured, or grown in a special medium. To make this process more rapid and efficient, diagnostic tools developed by these institutions must provide results in three hours or less and be culture-independent (able to directly detect the specified pathogen from typically sterile sites, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid or the fluid surrounding the lungs). The NIAID awards were made to three companies and six academic organizations. Each academic organization partnered with an industrial institution with demonstrated experience in product development to be eligible for the award. The list of recipients can be found here.

In new experiments, the lab of bioengineer Jeffrey Jacot combined versatile amniotic stem cells with injectable hydrogels used as scaffolds in regenerative medicine and proved they enhance the development of vessels needed to bring blood to new tissue and carry waste products away. The results appear in the Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A. Jacot and his colleagues study the use of amniotic fluid cells from pregnant women to help heal infants born with congenital heart defects. Such fluids, drawn during standard tests, are generally discarded but show promise for implants made from a baby s own genetically matched material. He contends amniotic stem cells are valuable for their ability to differentiate into many other types of cells, including endothelial cells that form blood vessels.  The main thing we ve figured out is how to get a vascularized device: laboratory-grown tissue that is made entirely from amniotic fluid cells,  Jacot said.  We showed it s possible to use only cells derived from amniotic fluid.  In the lab, researchers from Rice, Texas Children s Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine combined amniotic fluid stem cells with a hydrogel made from polyethylene glycol and fibrin. Fibrin is a biopolymer critical to blood clotting, cellular-matrix interactions, wound healing and angiogenesis, the process by which new vessels branch off from existing ones. Fibrin is widely used as a bioscaffold but suffers from low mechanical stiffness and rapid degradation. Combining fibrin and polyethylene glycol made the hydrogel much more robust, Jacot said. The lab used vascular endothelial growth factor to prompt stem cells to turn into endothelial cells, while the presence of fibrin encouraged the infiltration of native vasculature from neighboring tissue. Mice injected with fibrin-only hydrogels showed the development of thin fibril structures, while those infused with the amniotic cell/fibrin hydrogel showed far more robust vasculature, according to the researchers. Similar experiments using hydrogel seeded with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells also showed vascular growth, but without the guarantee of a tissue match, Jacot said. Seeding with endothelial cells didn t work as well as the researchers expected, he said. The lab will continue to study the use of amniotic cells to build biocompatible patches for the hearts of infants born with birth defects and for other procedures, Jacot said. Rice alumnus Omar Benavides, now a senior product development engineer at Procyrion, is lead author of the paper. Co-authors are Rice undergraduates Abigail Brooks and Sung Kyung Cho; Rice alumnus Jennifer Petsche Connell, now a researcher at Houston Methodist Hospital Research Institute, and Rodrigo Ruano, co-director of the Texas Children s Hospital Fetal Center and a professor at Baylor College of Medicine.

These findings indicate there is no need to alter how hospitals currently transfuse blood in adults going through complex cardiac surgical procedures. Results of the Red Cell Storage Duration Study (RECESS), supported by the NIH s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), appear in the New England Journal of Medicine. In the United States, red blood cell units can be stored up to 42 days after collection. Basic research has documented changes in red blood cell units the longer that they are stored. Some studies, primarily observational, have found an association between the transfusion of blood stored for a longer duration and increased morbidity and mortality. However, the clinical significance of these findings is difficult to determine due to study-design limitations. RECESS was a multicenter trial conducted at more than two dozen U.S. hospitals from January 2010 to January 2014 by the NHLBI-funded Transfusion Medicine and Hemostasis Clinical Trial Network (TMH CTN). The TMH CTN includes 17 core clinical centers and a data coordinating center. Patients were enrolled at most TMH CTN core clinical centers and some non-network centers. RECESS evaluated 1,098 cardiac surgery patients who were randomized to receive red blood cell units stored for short or long periods. Patients in the longer storage period group received their transfusions using current care practices. There was no statistical difference in the change in the primary clinical measure, the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS), or mortality from before cardiac surgery to seven or 28 days after the operation for both transfusion groups. The MODS was evaluated because it is an objective and validated way to assess small changes in six organ systems, which includes respiratory, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, hematologic and neurologic. There were no statistical differences in the mean number of serious and non-serious adverse events between the two groups.  RECESS contributes to a long-standing question about whether red blood cell storage duration impacts a patient s clinical outcome after transfusion.  said Keith Hoots, M.D., director of the NHLBI Division of Blood Diseases and Resources.  These findings are reassuring because they do not support the need to modify transfusion practices in adult patients undergoing complex cardiac surgery. In particular, there does not appear to be something gained by only transfusing red blood products stored for ten days or less.  Because very few RECESS patients were under 18 years of age, findings primarily apply to adult patients undergoing complex cardiac surgery.","Published: April 10, 2015"

The results suggest that the drug, chlorcyclizine HCl (CCZ), potentially could be used to treat the virus in people. Results were published April 8 in Science Translational Medicine. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes liver inflammation and often leads to serious complications such as cirrhosis. Early diagnosis and treatment of HCV can prevent liver damage. Drugs are available to treat HCV, but costs can reach tens of thousands of dollars.  Although hepatitis C is curable, there is an unmet need for effective and affordable medication,  said lead author T. Jake Liang, M.D., senior investigator at NIH s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).  CCZ is a promising candidate for part of a treatment regimen for this potentially life-threatening disease.  Conducted at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland, the study found that CCZ blocked the early stage of HCV infection likely by impairing the ability of the virus to enter human liver cells grafted in the mice. The outcome was similar to that of commonly used antiviral drugs but without those drugs  toxic side effects.  Using an innovative high-throughput screening process, we identified CCZ as a potent inhibitor of hepatitis C,  said Anton Simeonov, Ph.D., acting scientific director of NIH s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), which collaborated in the study.  Identifying already approved drugs from the NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection may offer a faster route to potential discovery of treatments for all diseases.  The researchers will next study how the drug affects people. CCZ is currently used for the treatment of allergies, not for HCV.  People should not take CCZ to treat their hepatitis C until it has been demonstrated that CCZ can be used safely and effectively for that purpose,  cautions Liang.  NIH research is vital to finding creative solutions for some of today s most serious public health issues,  said NIDDK Director Griffin P. Rodgers, M.D.  The CCZ medication may eventually provide an affordable alternative to costly options, especially in low-resource communities where hepatitis C infection is widespread.

As we age, the physical make up of our brains changes. This includes changes in neural processing in grey matter, but also in the deterioration of structural connections in the brain, which allow communication between distinct brain regions, so the brain is able to work as a well-wired network system. Researchers at the Lifelong Brain and Cognition Lab at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois have utilized the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) facilities available in Beckman's Biomedical Imaging Center to measure the moment-to-moment variability in brain activity, more specifically in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. In recent years, researchers have observed that this variability in the BOLD signal in the function of certain brain regions may be a good thing, linked to younger age and better cognitive performance. Greater variability may reflect more flexible or adaptive information processing. However, the association between BOLD variability and structural brain connectivity is not well understood. Also unknown is the association between brain signal variability and cognitive performance on various tasks such as memory, reasoning, speed, vocabulary, and semantic knowledge. Beckman researchers collected functional and structural MRI and looked at cognitive performance in 91 elderly, non-demented adults. They found that older adults who had greater variability in neural activity in specific brain regions performed better on fluid ability and memory tasks, and also had better quality of structural white matter connections in the brain. Their paper, ""White matter integrity supports BOLD signal variability and cognitive performance in the aging brain,"" is published in PLOS ONE. ""Our study is important as it explores the relationships between moment-to-moment variability in spontaneous brain activity and broadly defined cognitive performance in older adults,"" said Agnieszka Burzynska, postdoctoral researcher in the Lifelong Brain and Cognition Lab and author of the study. ""We think that greater variability in brain function in certain regions allows better processing of information, especially during highly demanding memory and reasoning tasks, which require someone to remember information, form associations, or perform abstract mental operations. We believe that variability in the brain activity reflects the dynamic use of different brain networks. In the aging research, there are mixed findings on whether aging is associated with increased or decreased amplitude of neural activity, and looking into variability of the signal gives us a new type of information on how the aging brain works.""

Most animals, from roundworms to humans, prefer the more predictable situation when it comes to securing resources for survival, such as food. Now, Salk scientists have discovered the basis for how animals balance learning and risk-taking behavior to get to a more predictable environment. The research reveals new details on the function of two chemical signals critical to human behavior: dopamine -- responsible for reward and risk-taking -- and CREB -- needed for learning. ""Previous research has shown that certain neurons respond to changes in light to determine variability in their environment, but that's not the only mechanism,"" says senior author Sreekanth Chalasani, an assistant professor in Salk's Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory. ""We discovered a new mechanism that evaluates environmental variability, a skill crucial to animals' survival."" By studying roundworms (Caenorhabditis elegans), Salk researchers charted how this new circuit uses information from the animal's senses to figure out how predictable the environment and prompt the worm to move to a new location if needed. The work is detailed in the journal Neuron. The circuit, made up of 16 of the 302 neurons in the worm's brain, likely has parallels in more complex animal brains, researchers say, and could be a starting point to understanding -- and fixing -- certain psychiatric or behavioral disorders. ""What was surprising is the degree to which variability in animal behavior can be explained by variability in their past sensory experience and not just noise,"" says Tatyana Sharpee, associate professor and co-senior author of the paper. ""We can now predict future animal behaviors based on past sensory experience, independent of the influence of genetic factors."" The team discovered that two pairs of neurons in this learning circuit act as gatekeepers. One pair responds to large increases of the presence of food and the other pair responds to large decreases of the presence of food. When either of these high-threshold neurons detect a large change in an environment (for example, the smell of a lot of food to no food) they induce other neurons to release the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dumping dopamine onto a brain -- human or otherwise -- makes one more willing to take risks. It's no different in the roundworm: stimulated by large varieties in its environment, dopamine surges in the worm's system and activates four other neurons in the learning circuit, giving them a greater response range. This prompts the worm to search more actively in a wider area (risk-taking) until it hits a more consistent environment. The amount of dopamine in its system serves as its memory of the past experience: about 30 minutes or so and it forgets information gathered in the time before that. While it's been known that the presence of dopamine is tied to risk-taking behavior, how exactly dopamine does this hasn't been well understood. With this new work, scientists now have a fundamental model of how dopamine signaling leads the worm to take more risks and explore new environments. ""The connection between dopamine and risk is conserved across animals and is already known, but we showed mechanistically how it works,"" says Chalasani, who is also holder of the Helen McLoraine Developmental Chair in Neurobiology. ""We hope this work will lead to better therapies for neurodegenerative and behavioral diseases and other disorders where dopamine signaling is irregular."" Interestingly, the scientists found that the high-threshold neurons also lead to increased signaling from a protein called CREB, known in humans and other animals to be essential to learning and retaining new memories. The researchers showed that not only are the presence of CREB important to learning, but the amount of CREB protein determines how quickly an animal learns. This surprising connection could lead to new avenues of research for brain enhancements, adds Chalasani. How did researchers test all of this in worms exactly? They began by placing worms in dishes that contained either a large or a small patch of edible bacteria. Worms in the smaller patches tended to reach the edges more frequently, experiencing large changes in variability (edges have large amounts of food compared to the center). Worms on the large patch, however, reached the edge less frequently, thereby experiencing a general stable environment (mainly an area with constant food). Using genetics, imaging, behavioral analysis and other techniques, researchers found that when worms are on small patches, the two pairs of high-threshold neurons respond to the greater variation and signal leading to increased dopamine. When worms in these smaller patches (and higher dopamine) were taken out and put into a new dish, they explored a larger area, taking more of a risk. Worms from the larger patches, however, produced less dopamine and were more cautious, exploring just a small space when placed in a new area. Additionally, when the protein CREB was present in larger amounts, the team found that the worms took far less time to learn about their food variability. ""Normally the worms took about 30 minutes or so to explore and learn about food, but as you keep increasing the CREB protein they learn it faster,"" says Chalasani. ""So dopamine stores the memory of what these worms learn while CREB regulates how quickly they learn."" Salk Institute for Biological Studies  press release Adam J.

Now, with help from a specially devised mechanical exoskeleton that positioned monkeys' hands in different postures, Johns Hopkins researchers have challenged that view. In a paper published in the April 22 issue of Neuron, they present evidence that the two types of information are integrated as soon as they reach the brain by sense-processing brain cells once thought to be incapable of such higher-order thought. Past studies have indicated that the feel of an object against the skin and position information of the hands and fingers were processed separately in the sensory system's first-line sense processors, and then passed along to more sophisticated brain regions to be integrated. But it was a challenge to reliably differentiate brain activity caused by the two inputs from one another and from the brain's commands to muscles, says Manuel Gomez-Ramirez, Ph.D., an assistant research scientist at The Johns Hopkins University. To solve that problem, Steven Hsiao, Gomez-Ramirez's late mentor, and his colleagues developed a machine that positions a monkey's hand and delivers stimuli to its fingers. In this experiment, then-graduate student Sung Soo Kim, Ph.D., now a research specialist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, trained monkeys to perform an unrelated visual task while their hands were manipulated by the machine, which moved their fingers slightly from side to side and up and down at precise angles. The machine also pressed a plastic bar to the monkeys' fingertips in different orientations. By monitoring the monkeys' brains in real time, the research group saw that the position and touch information were conveyed through the same cells in the somatosensory cortex. ""This study changes our understanding of how position and touch signals are combined in the brain,"" says Gomez-Ramirez. This information could be used in efforts to better integrate prostheses with patients' brains so that they behave more like natural limbs, he notes. ""Holding objects and exploring the world with our hands requires integrating many sensory signals in the brain and continuously supplying this information to motor areas so that it can issue the appropriate commands for holding objects,"" Gomez-Ramirez says. ""Our understanding of how these processes occur is very limited, and Steve Hsiao spent a lot of time thinking about the problem and figuring out how to test it.""

A study published online in the journal Neuron reveals the reason: At the very first signs of possible autism in infants and toddlers, neural activity in language-sensitive brain regions is already similar to normal in those ASD toddlers who eventually go on to develop good language ability but nearly absent in those who later have a poor language outcome. ""Why some toddlers with ASD get better and develop good language and others do not has been a mystery that is of the utmost importance to solve,"" says senior author Eric Courchesne, co-director of the UC San Diego Autism Center, where the study was designed and conducted. ""Discovering the early neural bases for these different developmental trajectories now opens new avenues to finding causes and treatments specific to these two very different subtypes of autism."" The researchers studied 60 ASD and 43 non-ASD infants and toddlers using the natural sleep functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method developed by the UCSD Autism Center investigators to record brain activity in the participants as they listened to excerpts from children's stories. All toddlers were clinically followed until early childhood to make a final determination of which ones eventually had good versus poor language outcomes. In ASD, good language outcomes by early childhood were preceded by normal patterns of neural activity in language-sensitive brain regions, including superior temporal cortex, during infant and toddler ages. By contrast, ASD children with poor language outcomes showed very little activity in superior temporal cortex when they were toddlers or infants. ""Our study is important because it's one of the first large-scale studies to identify very early neural precursors that help to differentiate later emerging and clinically relevant heterogeneity in early language development in ASD toddlers,"" says first author Michael Lombardo of the University of Cyprus. The researchers also found that, when combined with behavioral tests, these striking early neural differences may help predict later language outcome by early childhood. The prognostic accuracy of the combined neural and behavioral measures was 80%, compared with 68% for each measure alone. ""One of the first things parents of a toddler with ASD want to know is what lies ahead for their child,"" says co-author Karen Pierce, also co-director of the UC San Diego Autism Center. ""These findings open insight into the first steps that lead to different clinical and treatment outcomes, and in the future, one can imagine clinical evaluation and treatment planning incorporating multiple accurate behavioral and medical prognostic assessments. That would be a huge practical benefit for families."" Moving forward, the researchers will further investigate the early neural functional substrates that precede and underlie language and social heterogeneity in ASD. They also plan to test the idea that activation, or its absence, in language cortex predicts treatment responsiveness in toddlers with ASD. Moreover, future research on the molecular underpinnings of variable clinical outcomes in individuals with ASD could pave the way for the development of novel pharmacological interventions. ""Understanding that there are discrete subgroups of early developing ASD that are distinguished by developmental behavioral trajectories, neural underpinnings, and brain-behavioral relationships, really lays the groundwork for a whole range of really fruitful directions,"" Lombardo says.

These two responses to members of the opposite sex are encoded in the amygdala, the researchers report. The findings, reported in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, challenge traditional notions about the role of the amygdala, the researchers say. The team evaluated 93 children's attitudes toward same-sex and opposite-sex peers. Using fMRI the researchers also analyzed brain activity in 52 children. The amygdala was once thought of as a ""threat detector,"" said University of Illinois psychology and Beckman Institute professor Eva Telzer, who led the new analysis. ""But increasing evidence indicates that it is activated whenever someone detects something meaningful in the environment,"" she said. ""It is a significance detector."" The finding that very young children are paying close attention to gender is not a surprise, Telzer said. ""We know that there are developmental changes in terms of the significance of gender boundaries in young kids,"" Telzer said. ""We also know about the whole 'cooties' phenomenon,"" where young children develop an aversion to opposite-sex peers and act as if members of the opposite sex could, if they got too close, contaminate them with a dreadful infestation. Children at this age also tend to strongly prefer the company of their same-sex peers, she said. This phenomenon was reflected in young children's evaluations of each other. ""Only the youngest children in our sample demonstrated a behavioral sex bias such that they rated same-sex peers as having more positive (and less negative) attributes than opposite-sex peers,"" the researchers wrote. ""And so we think the amygdala is signaling the significance of cooties at this developmental period,"" Telzer said. The interest in opposite-sex peers tends to wane in later childhood, just before puberty, Telzer said. The researchers saw no difference in the amygdala's response to same-sex and opposite-sex faces in children between the ages of 10 and 12. But in puberty, children's interest in opposite-sex peers blooms anew. They may become infatuated with a member of the opposite sex, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as a ""crush,"" Telzer said. ""When puberty hits, gender becomes more significant again, whether it's because your body is changing, or because of sexual attraction or you are becoming aware of more rigid sexual boundaries as you become more sexually mature,"" Telzer said.

Their study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, may one day help find treatments for nerve cell damage and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Neurons in the brain have extraordinarily high energy demands due to the complex dendrites that expand to high volume and surface areas. It is also known that neurons are the first to die from restriction of blood supply to tissues, causing a shortage of oxygen and glucose needed for cellular metabolism. Little was known, however, on how cells adjust to low energy level environments in the developing brain, when mitochondria--the so-called ""power plant"" of the cell--do not get delivered on time, and a lag in the energy distribution occurs, which may lead to a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. To unlock the mystery, the team studied mitochondria and energy consumption in a live, growing nerve cell over the course of a week. ""If neurons try to grow in low ATP energy levels, they could end up deformed, and even worse, put the life of the cell itself at stake,"" said Kansai Fukumitsu, who was involved in the study. ""Since a single mitochondria in the root of the cell is not enough to supply energy to the nerve ends, the cell distributes mitochondria to its most outer branches to deliver power where energy levels are scarce."" In areas of low ATP energy concentrations, chemical changes were brought by molecular proteins, which stopped the dendrites from growing further. ""We found two protein molecules that synergistically produced enzymes to allocate energy molecules where it is direly needed for cellular survival,"" says Mineko Kengaku, the principal investigator of the study from iCeMS. In the future, Kengaku and her co-authors envision treatments for incurable diseases by mapping the nerve cell metabolism in an energy-deprived state.

The study, led by researchers from the Whitehead Institute and MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, found that a subset of glioblastoma tumor cells is dependent on a particular enzyme that breaks down the amino acid glycine. Without this enzyme, toxic metabolic byproducts build up inside the tumor cells, and they die. Blocking this enzyme in glioblastoma cells could offer a new way to combat such tumors, says Dohoon Kim, a postdoc at the Whitehead Institute and lead author of the study, which appears in the April 8 online edition of Nature. David Sabatini, a professor of biology at MIT and member of the Whitehead Institute, is the paper s senior author. Matthew Vander Heiden, the Eisen and Chang Career Development Associate Professor of Biology and a member of the Koch Institute, also contributed to the research, along with members of his lab. GLDC caught the researchers  attention as they investigated diseases known as  inborn errors of metabolism,  which occur when cells are missing certain metabolic enzymes. Many of these disorders specifically affect brain development; the most common of these is phenylketonuria, marked by an inability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine. Such patients must avoid eating phenylalanine to prevent problems such as intellectual disability and seizures. Loss of GLDC produces a disorder called nonketotic hyperglycinemia, which causes glycine to build up in the brain and can lead to severe mental retardation. GLDC is also often overactive in certain cells of glioblastoma, the most common and most aggressive type of brain tumor found in humans. The researchers found that GLDC, which breaks down the amino acid glycine, is overexpressed only in glioblastoma cells that also have high levels of a gene called SHMT2, which converts the amino acid serine into glycine. Those cells are so dependent on GLDC that when they lose it, they die. Further investigation revealed that SHMT2 is expressed most highly in cancer cells that live in so-called ischemic regions - areas that are very low in oxygen and nutrients. These regions are often found at the center of tumors, which are inaccessible to blood vessels. It turns out that in this low-oxygen environment, SHMT2 gives cells a survival edge because it can indirectly influence the activity of an enzyme called PKM2, which is part of the cell s machinery for breaking down glucose. Regulation of PKM2 can impact whether cells can generate the material to build new cancer cells, but the same regulation also affects the consumption of oxygen - a scarce resource in ischemic regions.  Cells that have high SHMT2 activity have low PKM2 activity, and consequently low oxygen-consumption rates, which makes them better suited to survive in the ischemic tumor microenvironment,  Kim says. However, this highly active SHMT2 also produces a glut of glycine, which the cell must break down using GLDC. Without GLDC, glycine enters a different metabolic pathway that generates toxic products that accumulate and kill the cell. The finding also raises the possibility that these GLDC-dependent cells could be killed with drugs that block GLDC activity, according to the researchers, who are now seeking potential drug compounds that could do just that.","Published: April 9, 2015"

It is estimated that more than 158,000 people will die from lung cancer in the United States this year. Many scientists believe that targeting a type of cell called a cancer stem cell may be necessary to completely cure lung cancer. Moffitt Cancer Center researchers discovered a novel mechanism that plays an important role in the maintenance of lung cancer stem cells. This finding may lead to new potential therapeutic targets. Cancer stem cells are a subset of cells within tumors that are believed to be responsible for the initiation of cancer. Cancer stem cells can reproduce themselves through a process called self-renewal and sustain the growth of a tumor. According to Srikumar P. Chellappan, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Tumor Biology at Moffitt,  these cells can also contribute to the metastasis of tumors as well as the reappearance of tumors after they have been eliminated from the body.    A protein called YAP1 was previously shown to contribute to the growth of lung cancer cells; however, it was unknown how YAP1 controls lung cancer growth and progression. Moffitt researchers found that YAP1 plays an important role in cancer stem cell self-renewal.   They reported that YAP1 is found at high levels in lung cancer stem cells and binds to a protein called OCT4.  Together, YAP1 and OCT4 regulate a third protein called SOX2.  This intricate regulation process allows stem cells to maintain their ability to undergo self-renewal and form blood vessel-like structures. The team compared the levels of YAP1 and OCT4 in lung cancer and normal tissue.  They discovered that YAP1 is present at higher levels and interacts with OCT4 more in primary and metastatic lung tumors than normal tissue. Additionally, lung cancer patients who have high levels of YAP1 in their tumors are more likely to have a poorer prognosis than patients with low levels of YAP1.  These observations suggest that YAP1 may be a potential therapeutic target. The researchers confirmed this hypothesis by showing that if they blocked YAP1 they could inhibit stem cells from undergoing self-renewal, forming blood vessel-like structures, and reduce lung cancer cell growth in mice.  These results raise the possibility that inhibitors of YAP1 function or agents that can disrupt the binding of YAP1 to OCT4 could have anti-cancer effects.  The identification of novel and effective inhibitors of YAP1 activity can be expected to have significant benefits as anticancer agents,  explained Chellappan.

The field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) has expanded rapidly the last decade, driven by the aim to improve quality of life by advancing healthcare. The process of generating functional human tissue from cells, in a laboratory or clinical environment, has many important factors, such as the biochemical composition of the cellular environment. However, one important factor that has been recognized more recently to play an important role in cell differentiation and tissue formation is the mechanical properties of (bio)material grafts, substitutes and scaffolds.  Traditional trade-offCharacterizing the mechanical properties of soft (bio)materials is traditionally a trade-off between measuring the bulk mechanical properties, i.e. by rheology, bulk compression or tensile testing, and  methods that enable investigating local mechanical properties, i.e. traditional (micro-, nano-) indentation or atomic force microscopy (AFM). In tissue engineering and regenerative medicine this trade-off is even more stressed, as the need for local interrogation is combined with the need for high sensitivity, compatibility and ease of use with biological samples, e.g. measuring in liquid environments. Where AFM s typically match high sensitivity, they can be complex to operate and setting up an experiment can be time consuming due to extensive alignment and calibration procedures.  Combining the best of two worldsTo enable mechanical studies for tissue, cell and biomaterial researchers, Optics11 has designed the Piuma Nanoindenter, which captures the benefits of both traditional nanoindenters and AFM solutions, but not their limitations. The Piuma Nanoindenter uses a novel proprietary optical interferometric technology in combination with a monolithical cantilever probe that enables the automated characterization of the local mechanical properties of the softest materials with high sensitivity, speed and ease of use.  ""The Piuma opened a new world for us. We now are able to perform measurements on very low stiffness tissues, with a precision that allows us to study embryos.

Many applicationsThe Piuma is currently being used in a number of key universities and research institutes, improving graft and scaffold characteristics and contributing to the understanding of mechanical processes down to the cell level. At present, the Piuma enables researchers to advance the engineering and regeneration of dermis, cartilage, cornea, bone and many other tissues, as well as (stem)cell development in environments with specific mechanical properties. Typical scaffold materials such as hydrogels and polymers are characterized routinely. In addition, the Piuma is used for studying disease models, such as brain conditions, liver conditions, eye conditions, and many more. In general the Piuma is contributing to an improved quality of life by advancing researchers  understanding of the mechanical properties of (bio)materials, tissues and (stem)cells. ""The Piuma is a very powerful, reliable, and use-friendly instrument to assess the mechanical properties of both living tissue (e.g. tissue explants) and in vitro engineered tissue.""

Maximal flexibilitySample mounting is made easy with the Piuma system: it fits almost any container, petri dish or multi-well plate up to 12 wells. If you require more flexibility, for example when combining nanoindentation with other analysis instruments, such as optical microscopes, this is also possible with the Piuma Chiaro. This enables not only the mechanical characterization of single cells, as well as investigating specific or very local sites of tissues and scaffolds. Author Biography","Published: April 9, 2015"

Under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement, Microbiome s multiplex PCR assay for identification of sepsis-causing microorganisms will be further developed as an integrated multiplex real-time PCR assay on Biocartis  Idylla  platform for use in conjunction with a new platform under development by Biocartis, called Idylla -Enrich. Financial details of the agreement are not disclosed. Idylla -Enrich is a dedicated pre-enrichment platform for bloodstream infections. Rudi Pauwels, Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis, commented:  Molecular diagnostics for bloodstream infections pose a classical needle-in-a-haystack problem; the vast excess of human DNA limits the amount of blood sample that can be used in a pathogen specific molecular analysis. The ability of our Idylla -Enrich platform to selectively enrich pathogen DNA from 10 ml of whole blood represents an enormous breakthrough in sensitivity as low pathogen concentrations down to 1 colony-forming unit (CFU)/ml can now be detected.  The Idylla -Enrich method has extensively been tested as part of the largest sepsis study in Europe to date comprising almost 7,500 clinical samples. Biocartis will further develop the platform and plans to launch it for use in conjunction with the pathogen identification test licensed from Microbiome as a streamlined solution for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections. Sepsis occurs when the body s response to an infection spirals out of control and can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock, with a mortality rate of nearly 50% in the event of severe sepsis. Almost 30 million patients per year worldwide encounter a septic episode. There is evidence that a delay in the treatment of a patient with sepsis increases mortality by 7.6% per hour in the first six hours. These figures call for a faster and more accurate diagnosis. When diagnosing sepsis or bloodstream infections, typically a blood sample of the patient is analyzed for the presence of pathogens. Today s gold standard approach to detect the pathogens is blood culture which typically takes 24-48 hours for bacteria and even 5 days for fungi, which considerably delays a targeted therapy and contributes to high sepsis mortality. By combining the enrichment with a multiplex PCR assay on the Idylla  platform it is possible to identify pathogens in bloodstream infections much faster, reducing current approaches of 24-48 hours to as little as 2 hours. Paul Savelkoul, Chief Executive Officer of Microbiome, commented:  The combination of rapid and highly sensitive identification of bloodstream pathogens with a panel of key antimicrobial resistance genes will have a major impact on clinical practice. This assay will enable clinicians for the first time to initiate optimal treatment within hours instead of days after admission of a patient. As a spin-off of a medical center, Microbiome builds on extensive clinical experience. Combined with Biocartis  technology, we feel we are creating the optimal clinical sepsis test.  Prof. Jean-Louis Vincent, Professor of Intensive Care Medicine (University of Brussels) and a key opinion leader in the field of sepsis management commented,  Early and adequate antimicrobial therapy is of paramount importance in the management of severe infections. There is a real unmet clinical need for tests providing rapid identification of microorganisms so that appropriate antibiotics can be started as soon as possible. ","Published: April 9, 2015"

This agreement showcases the alliance s commitment to establishing a combined oncology sales organization in key markets in advance of the potential launch of avelumab-based treatment regimens in the future. XALKORI is the first ALK inhibitor approved in the United States, Japan and the European Union (EU) and is supported by two positive global randomized trials in the first- and second-line ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment settings. To date, globally more than 8,000 patients have been treated with XALKORI, including those who received XALKORI in clinical trials. Under the agreement, XALKORI will be co-promoted in two waves, the first of which will begin in the second and third quarters of 2015 in the United States, Canada, Japan and five European Union countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). In the United States and Canada, XALKORI will be co-promoted by EMD Serono, the US and Canadian biopharmaceutical businesses of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. The second wave will begin in 2016 and includes China and Turkey. In 2015, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, will receive a reimbursement associated with its promotion of XALKORI, followed by an 80 percent (Pfizer), 20 percent (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) profit sharing on the product starting in 2016. The co-promotion term will last through December 31, 2020 for the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, and from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2021 in China and Turkey.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/cells-exercise-suboptimal-strategy-to-survive-190102,Cells Exercise Suboptimal Strategy to Survive Rice University study shows it s not always good for cells  metabolism to work at peak efficiency  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. There are few times in life when one should aim for suboptimal performance, but new research at Rice University suggests scientists who study metabolism and its role in evolution should look for signs of just that. A study published this month in the journal BMC Systems Biology details a computational method called corsoFBA. FBA stands for flux balance analysis and the program predicts internal cell flux - the rate at which cells process and store energy - at what researchers call suboptimal growth. The ultimate goal of the study is to discover how organisms, including humans, adapt to changing environments, including the body s response during exercise. The method allows researchers to model how metabolic pathways, chains of chemical reactions in the cells of all living beings, will react in the presence or absence of certain conditions, like the availability of oxygen or the acidity of the environment. It does so by measuring how a cell spends its fixed energetic resources - its protein cost - to preserve flux in more than one pathway. The work springs from the mind and talents of a Rice graduate student who spent years training his body for absolutely optimal performance. Andr  Schultz is a former member of the Brazilian national swim team who trained alongside Olympic legend Michael Phelps at the University of Michigan. As an undergraduate there, he divided his time between competitive swimming and academics, particularly his love for mathematics. At Rice, where he is a student of bioengineer and co-author Amina Qutub, Schultz turned his attention to biophysics, specifically mathematical models of metabolic pathways. As an elite swimmer, Schultz trained at high altitude to maximize his endurance by calling upon his own metabolic pathways to make adjustments. In an oxygen-depleted environment, athletes who train between 6,000 and 7,000 feet above sea level can temporarily increase their red blood cell count and alter muscle metabolism in ways that benefit their performance closer to sea level. One focus of the Qutub lab at Rice s BioScience Research Collaborative is the study of hypoxia, or oxygen starvation, and its effect on biological systems. The lab studies molecular signaling pathways through computer models and experiments to see how they impact the body s response to oxygen and how the pathways can be manipulated. The goals are to treat stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, stop cancer progression - and learn how organisms adapt to their environments. Standard computer models like flux balance analysis, developed in the 1980s, look at a metabolic pathway s optimal performance, but Schultz said they don t show the whole picture.  Flux balance analysis is geared for optimization, and it works really well with microorganisms, which is where most of this analysis has been applied,  he said.  When you simulate the growth of bacteria - E. coli, for example - it s safe to assume that bacteria are trying to grow as much as possible.  But if you look at a muscle, its cells are not always trying to move as much as they can,  Schultz said.  You re not always using maximal force. So the ability to see what a system is doing at suboptimal levels is beneficial.  Metabolism can take many routes to turn sugars into energy-storing adenosine triphosphate or prompt the production of particular catalytic compounds. Schultz said discussions among researchers, including University of California at San Diego Professor Bernhard Palsson, a pioneer in the field of whole genome wide metabolic reconstruction who mentored him during a visit to Rice earlier this year, have led to the belief that two factors - greed and fear - can keep a cell s performance suboptimal for its own good. But no study has sought to quantify suboptimal signaling, he said.  When bacteria are greedy, they want to grow and multiply, but conditions might change at some point, and they might have to adapt,  he said.  So they invest protein cost and leave some flux through alternate pathways in case, for example, the pH suddenly changes and they re in an acid or base environment, or they had to switch from glucose to acetate (to produce energy).  This fear part puts them on guard and takes away from greed,  he said. Qutub suspects organisms hedge their bets as a matter of course. Learning the secrets of alternate molecular pathways could provide clues about how to use them to patients  advantage, she said.  Our question is, How does the hypoxia response pathway interact with metabolism in a way that allows animals to adapt at the tissue and whole-body level? The answer for mammalian systems is that cells don t optimize these pathways to achieve the maximal growth possible, with the possible exception of cancer cells,  Qutub said. One immediate goal is to use Schultz s model to predict how humans adapt to high- and low-altitude hypoxia.  First, we ll be testing on deer mice that have adapted to two extreme environments: the Colorado mountains and Death Valley,  she said. Schultz has traveled with the lab s collaborators, Jay Storz at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Zac Cheviron at the University of Illinois, to gather mice from low and high altitudes to study how they have successfully adapted to their environments - as he once did. While the proof-of-principal study focuses on flux in single-cell bacteria, the lab s ongoing work will extend analysis to muscle, liver and fat tissue in mammals.  We chose these tissues because they re particularly important during exercise,  Qutub said.","Published: April 9, 2015"

Most of the money has been directly reinvested in new research programs, demonstration projects, laboratory equipment and staff at the Department of Energy national laboratory in Richland, or reinvested by Battelle in research-related activities consistent with its non-profit mission. The technologies were developed at PNNL as well as at EMSL, DOE's Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory on the PNNL campus. It's the first time that income tied to a specific technology developed at PNNL has reached this level. The income was earned from multiple licenses over nearly a 20-year period. The annual amount has steadily increased over the past five years. Since 1989, dozens of PNNL researchers have been enhancing the performance of mass spectrometers - at first for use in PNNL's own environmental, national security and health-related research programs, and then as part of efforts to improve the science impact of mass spectrometers in the marketplace. Mass spectrometry is an ultra-sensitive analytical technique that helps identify and measure the amount and type of elements, molecules and isotopes present in samples ranging from soils to proteins. It's widely used to analyze samples in the biotechnology, environmental, biofuel, national security, medical and drug testing fields. The technology is used in early detection of disease biomarkers and environmental contaminants, quality assurance and the development of new products. Through licenses, PNNL has transferred the technology enhancements to many companies, including Agilent Technologies in Santa Clara, Calif.; Bruker Daltonics in Billerica, Mass.; Thermo Fisher Scientific in San Jose, Calif., and several others. These firms are manufacturing and selling mass spectrometers to customers worldwide. ""Based upon the royalty rates in the various licenses, it is estimated that the royalties received by PNNL represent more than 5,000 mass spectrometer instruments sold to date that were based in part on PNNL intellectual property,"" said Bruce Harrer, a PNNL commercialization manager. ""We've benefited greatly from PNNL's developments,"" said John Fjeldsted, Agilent Technology's senior director of ion mobility for Agilent's Mass Spectrometry Division. ""One of the PNNL technologies - the ion funnel - has made significant contributions to the sensitivity of our top-tier products, including those involving ion mobility and time-of-flight measurements."" PNNL works with mass spectrometer manufacturers to develop and commercialize these technologies through an active program of collaborative research and development projects. ""We have had a number of collaborative R&D projects with PNNL over the past 20 years, many of which have led to important advances in the field,"" said Iain Mylchreest, vice president for research and development in Thermo Fisher's Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry Division. Royalties enabling further research at PNNL ""Much of the licensing proceeds have been reinvested at PNNL and, by extension, have benefited the Mid-Columbia region,"" explained Cheryl Cejka, director of Technology Deployment & Outreach at PNNL. Under Battelle's contract to manage and operate PNNL for DOE, Battelle and DOE may share the costs of bringing a technology to the point that it can be licensed and then share in any proceeds. This long-term partnership has enabled substantial reinvestment in the form of new research projects and additional capabilities at PNNL, such as new mass spectrometer instruments. ""In addition to advancing scientific discovery, this arrangement is a win-win for taxpayers, DOE and Battelle,"" said Cejka. ""Taxpayers and society at large benefit from the deployment of new products in the marketplace. The government benefits from the investments made into federally-owned laboratory capabilities. Battelle benefits from the reinvestment of net proceeds into new facilities, equipment, staff capabilities or further research and technology development projects."" The Beat Goes On At PNNL and EMSL researchers continue to further develop and utilize mass spectrometry technology. Researchers in PNNL's Biological Sciences Division have recently been awarded several patents for developing a new technology capable of separating and manipulating ions, which can be used to improve the sensitivity and power of mass spectrometers. Mass spectrometers are also being further developed and extensively used in PNNL's national security programs, including those directed at detecting and classifying radioactive materials and explosive compounds. At EMSL, researchers use more than a dozen mass spectrometers - some PNNL-designed and built, others purchased - to advance understanding and make discoveries in the fields of biofuels, health, climate and environmental remediation. EMSL's new 21 Tesla Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer, manufactured by Agilent and co-developed with EMSL, is one of the two strongest in the world.","Published: April 9, 2015"

Israel, MD with first author Gilbert J. Rahme, PhD, recently identified the transcription factor Id4 as a suppressor of tumor cell invasion in glioblastoma. Their work was recently published in Oncogene. A key finding was the mechanism by which Id4 silences matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), determined to be inhibition of the protein Twist1 that is required for MMP2 expression. ""This finding suggests a novel therapeutic target to decrease invasion of tumor cells in patients and may also provide a novel biomarker that could help predict survival of patients with glioblastoma,"" explained Israel. Glioblastoma is the most lethal form of primary brain tumor and leads to death in patients by invading the brain tissue in a process that allows single cells to move through normal brain tissue, which makes complete surgical removal of the tumor impossible. Israel and his team sought to understand the mechanisms that drive tumor invasion of normal tissue in glioblastoma. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Dartmouth team demonstrated that Id4 expression correlates with survival of glioblastoma patients and inversely correlates with MMP2 expression. The data suggests that the upregulation of MMP2 resulting from decreased Id4 expression in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) may contribute to the morbidity and mortality of GBM patients. This study used Dartmouth's Shared Resources including Microscopy and Molecular Biology. ""Using the core facilities greatly facilitated the conduct of the work saving time and reducing cost,"" Rahme said. All 14 of Dartmouth's Shared Resources are available to outside investigators by arrangement. ""Conventional drugs targeting the enzymes encoded by MMP genes have not been successful in the clinic due to adverse side effects,"" said Rahme. ""We believe that proteins in the pathway that controls the expression of MMP2 are likely to be better therapeutic targets. Targeting Twist1 might silence MMP2 and decrease tumor invasion, which will help patients with GBM. Furthermore, the expression of Id4 may serve as a tumor biomarker that can predict the degree of tumor infiltration."" Looking forward, the therapeutic targets revealed in this study to be actors in tumor invasion need to be further characterized as drug targets and, if possible, therapeutically inhibited. Their pursuit of Id4 as a biomarker for patients with GBM continues in hopes of making useful predictions of tumor invasion and survival.

The public display was a representative of thousands of such neuroprosthetic advances in recent years, and the tens of years of brain research and technological development that have gone into them. And while this display was quite an achievement in its own right, a Drexel University biomedical engineer working at the leading edge of the field contends that these devices are also opening a new portal for researchers to understand how the brain functions. Karen Moxon, PhD, a professor in Drexel's School of Biomedical Engineering Science and Health Systems, was a postdoctoral researcher in Drexel's medical school when she participated in the first study ever to examine how the brain could be connected to operate a prosthetic limb. More than 15 years after that neuroscience benchmark, Moxon's lab is showing that it's now possible to glean new insight about how the brain stores and accesses information, and into the causes of pathologies like epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. In a perspective published in the latest edition of the journal Neuron, Moxon and her colleague, Guglielmo Foffani from San Pablo University in Spain, build a framework for how researchers can use neuroprosthetics as a tool for examining how and where the brain encodes new information. The duo highlights three examples from their own research where the brain-machine-interface technology allowed them to isolate and study new areas of brain function. ""We believe neuroprosthetics can be a powerful tool to address fundamental questions of neuroscience,"" Moxon said. ""These subjects can provide valuable data as indirect observers of their own neural activity that are modulated during the experiments they are taking part in. This allows researchers to pinpoint a causal relationship between neural activity and the subject's behavior rather than one that is indirectly correlative."" The challenge faced by all scientists who study the brain is proving a direct relationship between the action of the subject and the behavior of brain cells. Each experiment is designed to chisel away at the uncertainty in this relationship with the goal of establishing causality--proof that the behavior of neurons in the brain is actually what is causing a subject to perform a certain action. Or, conversely, that a certain neural behavior is the direct result of an external stimulus. Neuroprosthetics, according to Moxon, could be the way around this obstacle. This is because the prosthetic, as a stand-in for an actual body part or set of them, is also a vehicle for getting real-time feedback from the brain. ""Subjects can be viewed as indirect observers of their own neurophysiological activity during neuroprosthetic experiments,"" Moxon said. ""To move the prosthesis they must think both about the motor functions involved and the goal of the movement. As they see the movement of the prosthetic their brain adjusts in real time to continue planning the movement, but doing it without the normal feedback from the moving body part--as the prosthetic technology is standing in for that part of the body."" This separation of planning and movement control was pivotal to Moxon's research on how the brain encodes for the passage of tS o Pauloime, which she recently reported in the Journal of Neuroscience. But this is just one example of how brain-machine-interface technology can be used to experimentally tease out and observe new certainties about the brain. Moxon, who was recently elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineers, suggests that in addition to the study of how neurons encode and decode information in real time, incorporating neuroprosthetics into experiments could also show how this coding process changes with learning and is altered in pathological conditions like the ones that cause epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. ""While the past 15 years have witnessed tremendous advancements in neuroprosthetic technology and our basic understanding of brain function, the brain-machine-interface approach is still expanding the landscape of neuroscienctific inquiry,"" Moxon said.

As described in a paper published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, cognitive neuroscientists at San Diego State University (SDSU) found that in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, the connections between the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum appear to be overdeveloped in sensorimotor regions of the brain. This overdevelopment appears to muscle in on brain ""real estate"" that in typically developing children is more densely occupied by connections that serve higher cognitive functioning. The study represents the first ever systematic look at connections between the entire cerebral cortex and the cerebellum using fMRI brain imaging, and its findings provide another piece in the puzzle that could one day lead researchers to develop a reliable brain-based test for identifying autism. Several decades ago, scientists reported findings that certain regions of the cerebellum -- a brain region involved in motor control, but also in cognitive, social, and emotional functions -- were often smaller in people with autism than in typically developing people. That sparked a brief flurry of research activity exploring the cerebellum's potential role in the disorder. Unfortunately, the direction never truly panned out for researchers hoping for a big breakthrough in understanding, said the study's corresponding author, SDSU psychologist Ralph-Axel M ller. ""Eventually, interest in the cerebellum waned due to a lack of consistency in the findings,"" he said. Hoping that advances in brain imaging technology would reveal new insights, M ller, working with the study's first author Amanda Khan, looked back to the cerebellum for their study. Khan is a former master's student at SDSU and now a doctoral candidate at Suffolk University in Boston. The researchers directed 56 children and adolescents, half with autism and half without the disorder, to fixate on a focal point while thinking about nothing in particular, using fMRI brain imaging technology to scan the children's brains as they produced spontaneous brain activity. Capturing this spontaneous activity is crucial to honing in on what are essentially baseline neuronal patterns. The imaging results revealed that the participants with autism had far stronger neuronal connectivity between sensorimotor regions of the cerebellum and cerebral cortex than did their counterparts without autism. Conversely, the participants with autism had less connectivity between regions involved in higher-order cognitive functions such as decision-making, attention and language. The sensorimotor connections between the cerebral cortex and cerebellum mature during the first few years of life, when the brains of children with autism grow larger in volume than typically developing children, M ller explained. Connections that serve higher cognitive functions develop later, after this period of overgrowth. ""Our findings suggest that the early developing sensorimotor connections are highly represented in the cerebellum at the expense of higher cognitive functions in children with autism,"" he said. ""By the time the higher cognitive functions begin to come online, many of the connections are already specialized. If a particular part of the brain is already functionally active in one domain, there may be no reason for the brain to switch it over to another domain later in life."" Returning to the real estate metaphor, it's as if most of the available land has already been scooped up by sensorimotor connections before the higher-order cognitive function connections have a chance to move into the neighborhood. The findings could help scientists and clinicians better understand exactly how abnormalities during brain development lead to various types of autism spectrum disorder. M ller hopes his work will not only contribute to a brain-based diagnosis of autism, but also be a step towards identifying its various subtypes and underlying genetic factors. ""We still don't understand what in the brain makes a kid autistic,"" he said. ""You can't look at a scan and say, 'There it is.' We're doing the groundwork of finding brain variables that might be biomarkers for autism and its subtypes."" San Diego State University   Original reporting by: Michael Price Amanda J.

It had an impact. ""My teammates and I noticed that yoga and meditation improved our flexibility and focus, but also made us feel better, not just when we were rowing but in our everyday lives,"" she recalled. ""I wondered if yoga and meditation really have scientific benefits, especially if they have specific effects on the brain, and if so, how that works."" Since becoming Rebecca Erwin Wells, M.D., she has done more than wonder about the effects of mind-body interventions, she has studied them. ""We're coming to recognize that meditation changes people's brains,"" said Wells, an assistant professor of neurology at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. ""And we're just beginning to gain understanding of what those changes mean and how they might benefit the meditator."" In separate clinical studies, Wells has looked into the effectiveness of a meditation and yoga program called mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) as a therapy for mild cognitive impairment -- problems with memory or other faculties without yet having dementia -- and for migraine headaches. In the first study, the participants were adults between 55 and 90 with mild cognitive impairment. Those who practiced MBSR for eight weeks had significantly improved functional connectivity in the brain's network that is active during introspective thought such as retrieving memories, along with trends of less atrophy in the hippocampus (the area of the brain responsible for emotions, learning and memory) compared with the participants who received conventional care. These findings indicate that meditation may positively affect the areas of the brain most impacted by Alzheimer's and thus may be capable of slowing the progress of the disease. Wells' second study found that adults with migraines who practiced MBSR for eight weeks had shorter and less debilitating migraines than those in the control group who received standard medical care. The members of the MBSR group also had trends of less frequent and less severe attacks, and reported having a greater sense of self-control over their migraines. ""Both of these were pilot studies with small subject groups and additional research is needed, but I'm still very excited by the findings,"" said Wells, who began both studies while completing fellowships at Harvard Medical School. ""This type of meditation is a safe and relatively simple intervention, and if it can delay cognitive decline and help relieve migraines, it could contribute to improved quality of life for many of these individuals."" Another Wake Forest Baptist faculty member probing meditation's effects and capabilities is Fadel Zeidan, Ph.D., an assistant professor of neurobiology and anatomy. In his research Zeidan has demonstrated that as little as three 20-minute training sessions in mindfulness meditation can reduce pain and everyday anxiety in healthy individuals with no previous meditation experience. And through the use of a special type of imaging that captures longer-duration brain processes more effectively than a standard MRI scan, he has identified the specific brain mechanisms involved. In Zeidan's pain study, participants graded the pain caused by a device that heated a small area of their skin to 120 degrees. They rated the pain they felt while they meditated as 40 percent less intense and 57 percent less unpleasant than when they simply rested with their eyes closed. At the same time, the brain imaging showed decreased neural activity in the area of the brain involved in feeling the location and intensity of pain and increased activity in brain regions associated with attention and the ability to regulate emotions. In the anxiety-related research, the subjects reported decreases in everyday anxiety of as much as 39 percent after practicing meditation. The scans of their brains while they meditated, meanwhile, showed increased activity in areas of the cortex associated with regulating thinking, emotions and worrying. ""In these studies we've been able to get a better sense of the brain regions associated with reducing pain and anxiety during meditation,"" Zeidan said. ""Basically, by having people meditate while their brains are being scanned we've been able to objectively verify what people like Buddhist monks have been reporting about meditation for thousands of years."" Zeidan and Wells are currently working together on two new research trials. One, led by Zeidan, will attempt to determine more precisely how mindfulness meditation reduces pain and improves health. The other, led by Wells, will further investigate her pilot study's findings about meditation and migraines with a larger number of participants. ""Our research shows that meditation produces robust effects in behavior and in the brain and may provide an effective way for people to substantially reduce their pain,"" Zeidan said. ""What we have to do now is continue to find out exactly how it works and what it involves."" Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center","Published: April 8, 2015"

The discovery has been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Edaravone is currently available only in some Asian countries for the treatment of ischemic stroke -- the most common type of stroke which is caused by blood clots. Lead researcher Professor Xin-Fu Zhou, who is UniSA's Research Chair in Neurosciences, says Edaravone can alleviate Alzheimer's disease pathologies and improve functions of learning and memory -- in a mouse model of the disease -- by multiple mechanisms. ""Edaravone can bind the toxic amyloid peptide which is a major factor leading to degeneration of nerve cells,"" Prof Zhou says. Prof Zhou says lessons from failures of current clinical trials suggest that targeting multiple key pathways of the Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis is necessary to halt the disease progression. ""Edaravone can suppress the toxic functions of amyloid beta to nerve cells -- it is a free radical scavenger which suppresses oxidative stress that is a main cause of brain degeneration,"" he says. ""The drug can suppress the production of amyloid beta by inhibiting the amyloid beta production enzyme. It also inhibits the Tau hyperphosphorylation which can generate tangles accumulated in the brain cells and disrupt brain functions."" The research is a collaboration between Prof Zhou's lab within UniSA's Sansom Institute for Health Research and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, and labs led by Prof Yanjiang Wang in Chongqing, China. The researchers stress Edaravone should not be used for Alzheimer's patients before appropriate clinical trials are undertaken.

These studies, an absorption-metabolism-excretion ( AME ) study and a renal clearance study, are specialized clinical pharmacology trials that are required by the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for the approval of most drugs in development. The AME study enrolled 8 subjects and the renal clearance study enrolled 42 subjects. In both studies, ELND005 showed good safety and tolerability. The key result of the AME study was that ELND005 showed good oral bioavailability as there was nearly 100% absorption. ELND005 showed no evidence of hepatic or intermediary metabolism and the study demonstrated that the main excretion route of ELND005 is via the kidney. These AME properties of good oral bioavailability, low protein binding, and lack of CYP metabolism are usually associated with consistent plasma levels and with a reduced risk of drug-drug interactions. The AME profile of ELND005 is well suited for an Alzheimer s disease patient population that is commonly administered multiple concomitant medications, many of which are metabolized by the liver. The renal clearance study evaluated the pharmacokinetic profile of ELND005 in subjects with various degrees of renal impairment. In this study, ELND005 showed minimal protein binding in plasma regardless of renal function. Across the 5 study arms, subjects with worse renal function had increased plasma drug exposure compared to those with normal renal function. The study provided important guidance for the minimum creatinine clearance needed to allow patient participation in studies with a fixed dose regimen of ELND005. This minimum creatinine clearance is consistent with the threshold used as exclusion criterion in the ongoing study of ELND005 in Agitation and Aggression of AD (ELND005-AG201, the HarmonyAD Study).  The informative results from these studies together with the thorough QT study results reported last November, showing no QTc prolongation, are supportive of the suitability of ELND005 in the elderly AD population. These studies are part of a comprehensive package of data being complied by our wholly owned subsidiary, Transition Therapeutics Ireland Limited, to advance ELND005 toward regulatory approval,  said Dr. Tony Cruz, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Transition.","Published: April 8, 2015"

The tailor-made vaccines, given to three patients with advanced melanoma, appeared to increase the number and diversity of cancer-fighting T cells responding to the tumors. The finding is a boost to cancer immunotherapy, a treatment strategy that unleashes the immune system to seek out and destroy cancer. The research is reported April 2 in Science Express, in a special issue devoted to cancer immunology and immunotherapy. In a new approach, the cancer vaccines were developed by first sequencing the genomes of patients  tumors and samples of the patients  healthy tissues to identify mutated proteins called neoantigens unique to the tumor cells. Then, using computer algorithms and laboratory tests, the researchers were able to predict and test which of those neoantigens would be most likely to provoke a potent immune response and would be useful to include in a vaccine. The vaccines were given to melanoma patients who had had surgery to remove their tumors but whose cancer cells had spread to the lymph nodes, an indicator the deadly skin cancer is likely to recur. These clinical findings set the stage for a phase I vaccine trial, approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an investigational new drug application. The trial will enroll six patients. Data on the immune response seen in the first three patients is reported in the paper. If additional testing in more patients indicates the vaccines are effective, they may one day be given to patients after surgery to stimulate the immune system to attack lingering cancer cells and prevent a recurrence.  This proof-of-principle study shows that these custom-designed vaccines can elicit a very strong immune response,  said senior author Gerald Linette, MD, PhD, a Washington University medical oncologist leading the clinical trial at Siteman Cancer Center and Barnes-Jewish Hospital.  The tumor antigens we inserted into the vaccines provoked a broad response among the immune system s killer T cells responsible for destroying tumors. Our results are preliminary, but we think the vaccines have therapeutic potential based on the breadth and remarkable diversity of the T-cell response.  It s too early to say whether the vaccines will be effective in the long term, the researchers cautioned. The study was designed to evaluate safety and immune response; however, none of the patients has experienced adverse side effects. Earlier attempts at vaccines have focused on targeting normal proteins commonly expressed at high levels in particular cancers. Those same proteins also are found in healthy cells, making it difficult to stimulate a potent immune response. The new approach investigated by the Washington University team merges cancer genomics with cancer immunotherapy.  This is about as personalized as vaccines can get,  said co-author Elaine Mardis, PhD, co-director of the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University, where the cancer genome sequencing, analysis and neoantigen prediction were performed.  The approach we describe is fundamentally different from conventional mutation discovery, which focuses on identifying mutated genes that drive cancer development. Instead, we re looking for a unique set of mutated proteins in a patient s tumor that would be most likely to be recognized by the immune system as foreign.  Melanomas are notorious for having high numbers of genetic mutations caused by exposure to ultraviolet light. Biopsy samples of melanomas typically carry 500 or more mutated genes. Using prediction algorithms, the researchers narrowed their search for vaccine candidates by identifying neoantigens that not only were expressed in a patient s tumor but also were likely to be seen by that patient s immune system as  non-self.  Biochemical validation of neoantigen peptide expression on the cancer cells  surfaces was performed in collaboration with William Hildebrand s group at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center and provided critical assurance that the vaccine would elicit the most effective T cells to combat the melanoma.  You can think of a neoantigen as a flag on each cancer cell,  said first author Beatriz Carreno, PhD, associate professor of medicine.  Each patient s melanoma can have hundreds of different flags. As part of validating candidate vaccine neoantigens, we were able to identify the flags on the patients  cancer cells. Then we created customized vaccines to a select group of flags on each patient s tumor.  Carreno and her colleagues selected a set of seven unique neoantigens for each vaccine and used specialized immune cells called dendritic cells, derived from the patients, to carry those neoantigens to the immune system. Dendritic cells play an important role in waking up the immune system, reminding T cells to attack the cancer. After the vaccine infusions, the patients  blood was drawn every week for about four months. By analyzing the blood samples, the researchers could see that each patient mounted an immune response to specific neoantigens in their vaccines. The vaccines also stimulated diverse clones of battle-ready T cells against neoantigens, suggesting this approach also could be used to activate a range of T cells and target them to mutations in other cancers with high mutation rates, such as lung cancer, bladder cancer and certain colorectal cancers.  Our team has developed a new strategy for personalized cancer immunotherapy,  Linette said.  Many researchers have hypothesized that it would be possible to use neoantigens to broadly activate the human immune system, but we didn t know that for sure until now. We still have much more work to do, but this is an important first step and opens the door to personalized immune-based cancer treatments. ","Published: April 8, 2015"

The cartoon cat is a genetic anomaly, not because of his insatiable lasagna cravings, but because of his coat color. Outside the world of the Sunday comics, orange and black cats are almost invariably female. This truism is due to a curious biological phenomenon called X inactivation, which ensures that females of all species have only one active X chromosome in every cell. Early in development, when embryos have just few cells, one X chromosome is shut down or silenced in each cell. This chromosome remains inactive in all of that cell s progeny throughout the life of the animal. In cats and many other species, the selection of the chromosome to be inactive is random; in some other species, the X chromosome inherited from the father is always chosen. X inactivation is necessary to ensure that females, who have two X chromosomes, and males, who have only one, end up with roughly the same dosage of genes that occur on that chromosome. The  orange or black fur  gene is on the X chromosome, so a female cat can have a calico coat with both colors if  orange  and  black  remain active in different cells, but because a male cat has just one X chromosome it can be only one of these colors. Scientists have known about X inactivation for decades. Recently they learned that an RNA molecule called Xist is responsible. But it s not been at clear exactly how Xist works to silence genes on the X chromosome. Now researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have outlined the molecular steps of inactivation, showing that it occurs in an orderly and directed fashion as early embryonic cells begin to differentiate into more specialized tissues. They ve identified more than 80 proteins in mouse cells that bind to Xist to help it do its job. They hope their findings will shed light on conditions in humans that are typically more severe in one gender than the other. Gender differences in diseases  We see some very interesting phenomena with X-linked diseases in humans,  said Howard Chang, MD, PhD, professor of dermatology.  Often, when the faulty gene is on the X chromosome, the condition is more severe in boys. This happens in hemophilia, for example. In contrast, women are far more likely than men to suffer from autoimmune diseases, for reasons we don t yet understand. This research opens the door to possibly understanding the biological basis for these differences.  A paper describing the research findings will be published in the April 9 issue of Cell. Chang is the senior author, and former graduate student Ci Chu, PhD, is the study s lead author. The research required an entirely new technique, which was developed by Chu, to identify proteins interacting with Xist.  Usually people start with a protein of interest and look for RNA molecules that might associate with that protein. We wanted to start with the RNA and find out what proteins Xist is talking to,  said Chang.  Ci s new technique allowed us to discover the RNA and protein complexes responsible for X chromosome silencing.  The genes for orange and black fur are on the X chromosome in cats. Therefore, a female cat can have a patchwork of both orange and black fur depending on which chromosome was randomly inactivated in each ancestor cells. A male, however, can be orange or black, but not both. (An exception would be a male cat that had somehow inherited an extra X chromosome along the way, making it an XXY animal likely to have other significant genetic problems.) Chu s technique, which the researchers call CHIRP-MS for  comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry,  allowed the researchers to identify the sequential interaction of over 80 proteins with Xist during X inactivation. Many of these proteins have never before been associated with that process. It s thought that they may help target and anchor Xist to active genes along the length of the X chromosome like burrs on a shoelace after a hike in the woods. Elaborate genetic machinery  If you lay all the copies of Xist in a cell end to end, they are not long enough to coat the entire X chromosome,  said Chang.  Instead, Xist spreads judiciously, finding active genes and shutting them down. It also must stay anchored to the chromosome and not float over to any other chromosomes in the nucleus. This requires an elaborate set of machinery that we believe acts in a sequential fashion.  Specifically, the researchers suspect that some proteins help Xist locate and silence active genes, while others work to maintain that silencing once it has been established.  We re interested in really understanding this process, including how the inactivation of a specific X chromosome is maintained during DNA replication and cell division,  said Chang.  We and others are really excited by this research. ","Published: April 8, 2015"

Researchers at McMaster University have developed a new way to print paper biosensors, simplifying the diagnosis of many bacterial and respiratory infections. The new platform is the latest in a progression of paper-based screening technologies, which now enable users to generate a clear, simple answer in the form of letters and symbols that appear on the test paper to indicate the presence of infection or contamination in people, food or the environment. ""The simplicity of use makes the system easy and cheap to implement in the field or in the doctor's office,"" says John Brennan, director of McMaster's Biointerfaces Institute, where the work was done with biochemist Yingfu Li and graduate student Carmen Carrasquilla.The research, in its formative stage, addresses a key problem facing current paper-based biosensing techniques which are labour-intensive, sometimes costly and inconvenient, and often difficult to mass produce. Using state-of-the-art methods to produce ""bio-inks"", researchers can now use conventional office ink-jet printers to print man-made DNA molecules with very high molecular weight on paper, much like printing a letter in an office. The sheer size of the DNA -- which produces a signal when a specific disease biomarker is present -- is enough to ensure it remains immobilized and therefore stable. The paper sensor emerges from the printer ready to use, like pH paper. The implications are significant, says Brennan, since the new technology could be used in many fields where quick answers to important questions are critical. ""We could conceivably adapt this for numerous applications which would include rapid detection of cancer or monitoring toxins in the water supply,"" says Brennan. ""There are hundreds of possibilities."" A complete copy of the study, published online in the European journal Chemistry, can be found here.","Published: April 8, 2015"

Today, Kamps and her colleagues from KU and the University of Washington can say with certainty that they know how teachers, speech therapists and others can teach social and communication skills to kids with ASD and their peers in the classroom, at lunch and even at recess after the results of the first large randomized study of a social communication intervention verified years of earlier research. ""We know how to do this, and our research has shown us that it is not hard to teach people how to do it,"" she said. The four-year study, funded by the U.S. Department of Education, involved 95 students with ASD in Kansas and Washington. Of that group, 56 children participated in a two-year intervention from kindergarten through first grade in which each child was grouped with two to three typically developing classmates in a peer network, while the remaining 39 were the control group. The social peer network focused on teaching social communication skills such as requesting, commenting and saying ""niceties"" such as please and thank you while playing with toys and board games. To find out if the children were continuing to use social skills, the researchers followed up with probes outside of the intervention sessions at four points in time. ""We found that the children who participated in the social network not only made significant progress in social communication during the intervention but also made many more initiations to their peers in general,"" Kamps said. ""Teachers also reported that children in the intervention were more social and had better classroom behavior."" Although peer networks are still not used routinely in schools, often due to lack of resources, Kamps hopes that the promising results from larger studies will change that, and she said that some teachers who participated in the study have adopted the Peer Networks intervention in their classrooms.

Faulty wiring between PFC and other brain areas is thought to give rise to a variety of cognitive disorders. Disruptions to one particular brain circuit--between the PFC and the thalamus--have been associated with schizophrenia, but the mechanistic details are unknown. Now, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory scientists have discovered an inhibitory connection between these brain areas in mice that can control the timing of information flow into PFC. This insight may help explain what goes wrong in schizophrenia and indicate a path to new treatments. ""The PFC and thalamus have been implicated in schizophrenia in studies of humans as well as animal models,"" says CSHL Associate Professor Bo Li, ""yet the mechanism underlying the communication between these two areas has been unclear."" The thalamus acts as a gateway through which information from other parts of the brain is collected and processed before being sent on to the cortex. This thalamocortical circuit is often fine-tuned by inhibitory neurons, which tamp down signaling between message-propagating excitatory neurons. Li and colleagues focused on connections between sections of the PFC and the thalamus called the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the mediodorsal thalamus (MD). They observed a process called feedforward inhibition, a mechanism in which one neuron excites a neighboring or ""downstream"" neuron, but also recruits a third neuron to inhibit the downstream target after some delay. This process opens a narrow window in time during which the target neuron can be activated. When the thalamus propagates information gathered from the senses, feedforward inhibition acts to filter out extraneous inputs, resulting in highly precise sensory representations. Prior to the current research it was not known whether a similar inhibitory mechanism exists for the neural connection between mPFC and MD. The latter is an area associated with cognitive functioning rather than sensory processing. As described in work published in The Journal of Neuroscience, Li and his colleagues used optogenetic stimulation, a technique in which neurons expressing a light-sensitive protein are controlled with pulses of light, to activate neurons in the thalamus. These neurons in turn activated two classes of cells in the prefrontal cortex -- inhibitory PV interneurons as well as excitatory pyramidal neurons. The relative timing of their activation suggested to Li's team that the inhibitory cells might be shaping the activity of the excitatory ones.. The team now proposes that PV interneurons can dictate the time period during which the pyramidal neurons integrate excitatory input from neurons in the thalamus. ""The current problem for treating schizophrenia is the lack of drugs that work, so the discovery of this mechanism for the disease is exciting,"" says Li. ""This work is just the beginning of efforts to specify a neural pathway implicated in schizophrenia and what changes occur in this pathway."" In future experiments, Li and his team will assess in a genetic mouse model of schizophrenia whether there are any noticeable changes in the observed feedforward inhibition in the MD-mPFC pathway. ""This research can guide us to develop methods to reverse any changes we see in the MD-mPFC pathway in the animal model and could lead to improved therapeutics for this disease,"" says Li.

However, a recent study by researchers at the Institute of Pathobiochemistry at the Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz has produced no evidence that these fields can cause exacerbation or accelerated disease development in relevant mouse models. Neither learning behavior nor known disease mechanisms at the cellular level were affected. The results of the study have been published in the journal Scientific Reports of the Nature Publishing Group. The etiology of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is not yet understood. Less than 10 percent of patients have a matching family history, which means that the vast proportion of patients develop these diseases for so far unknown reasons. Age-related changes in metabolism, genetic predisposition, or environmental factors have been proposed as possible risk factors. In fact, according to the results of some epidemiological studies, the low-frequency magnetic fields that are generated, for example, by the alternating current (50 Hz) in power lines and electrical appliances while they are operating, may promote the development of these diseases. Yet other studies claim that the exposure to magnetic fields does not represent a risk factor in connection with Alzheimer's disease or ALS. Although the current scientific data is inconclusive, the World Health Organization (WHO) has decided to categorize low-frequency magnetic fields as a possible risk factor in Alzheimer's disease. In both Alzheimer's disease and ALS, there is progressive degeneration of neurons and thus loss of function of various groups of brain cells. ""At present, there is an extensive debate among the scientific community about how low-frequency magnetic fields might influence cell function at the molecular level,"" explained Dr. Albrecht Clement, principal investigator at the Institute of Pathobiochemistry at the Mainz University Medical Center. ""To our knowledge, no comprehensive study has been conducted so far to investigate the long-term effects of these fields on the onset of disease symptoms and the progression of both diseases under controlled conditions."" In the current project, which was financed by the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS), the researchers have been able to demonstrate for the first time in a long-term study in relevant animal models that controlled exposure to low-frequency magnetic fields over a period of up to 18 months does not influence the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease and ALS. A detailed analysis of the characteristic features of each disease showed that their development was in no way related to exposure to low-frequency magnetic fields. In the case of Alzheimer's disease, this also applied to the formation of pathological amyloid-beta protein plaque in the brain while in the case of ALS, there was no effect on the levels of proteins damaged by oxidative stress in the spinal cord. The inflammatory response in the nervous system that occurs in the course of both diseases was also unaffected during exposure. Moreover, neither learning behavior as an indicator of the progression of Alzheimer's disease nor the onset and the duration of ALS were influenced by the magnetic fields. ""These results show that exposure to low-frequency magnetic fields has no effect on either disease-related molecular processes or on potential, as yet unknown, disease mechanisms,"" said Clement. ""Our findings thus tend to confirm the results of previous epidemiological studies that indicate no damaging effects of low-frequency magnetic fields."" Nevertheless, extensive investigation is still necessary in order to clearly establish whether low-frequency magnetic fields have a pathogenic potential in humans or not.

In rare cases, patients may even lose their ability to perceive depth. Such patients see the world around them as flat, like a two-dimensional picture. This makes it impossible for them to judge distances accurately   a skill they need, for instance, when reaching for a cup or when a car is approaching them on the street. A patient with this particular type of visual dysfunction has recently been studied in detail by the research team at Saarland University led by Professor Georg Kerkhoff and Anna-Katharina Schaadt in collaboration with colleagues at the Charit  university hospital in Berlin. The team has developed the first effective treatment regime and have identified the area of the brain that, when damaged, may cause loss of binocular depth perception. The results of the study have been published in the journal  Neuropsychologia . Strokes can result in a wide variety of visual impairments.  A patient may, for example, be blind on one side so that he fails to perceive obstacles or people on that side or have problems when reading,  explains Georg Kerkhoff, Professor of Clinical Neuropsychology at Saarland University and head of the Neuropsychological Outpatient Service. In some cases, however, the consequences are even more serious. Recently, the team around Kerkhoff and Schaadt collaborated with Professor of Neurology Dr. Stephan Brandt and his colleague Dr. Antje Kraft, both at the Berlin Charit , in treating and supervising a patient who had lost his stereoscopic visual perception as a result of a stroke. Although the patient was able to perceive all the details of his surroundings, he was not able to assess distances with any accuracy.  Everything for him was flat, like on a painting,  explains Anna-Katharina Schaadt, a doctoral research student who is supervised by Kerkhoff and is the study s lead author.  He moved as if in slow-motion and was very uncertain about how far away a coffee cup was on a table or how quickly a car was approaching.  Like a blind person, he used a long cane to find his way around. Kerkhoff and Schaadt s team at the Neuropsychological Outpatient Service on the Saarbr cken campus began by looking for the cause of the patient s visual impairment.  We discovered that the patient was unable to converge the visual impressions from each eye into a single overall image,  says Schaadt. In healthy individuals, this process is known technically as  binocular fusion  and is important for three-dimensional vision. Once the diagnosis had been made, the team of neuropsychologists provided a three-week block of therapy during which the patient undertook daily training to improve his visual perception of depth. Three different training methods were employed. Special visual training equipment (prisms, vergence trainer and cheiroscope) were used to present the patient with two images with a slight lateral offset between them. By using what are known as convergent eye movements, the patient attempts to fuse the two images into a single image. This involves directing the eyes inward towards the nose while always keeping the images in the field of view. With time, the two separate images fuse to form a single image that exhibits stereoscopic depth, i.e. the patient has re-established binocular single vision.  It was as if a switch had been thrown; the patient was suddenly able to perceive spatial depth again, judge distances correctly and reach out and hold objects with confidence , describes Schaadt. The patient has now returned to work as a lawyer. At a follow-up examination a year later, the patient still exhibited good stereoscopic depth perception, and can therefore be considered to be permanently cured according to Professor Kerkhoff. The procedure could be used in future by therapists to help treat other stroke patients suffering from this extreme form of visual impairment. The results of the study are also of interest to researchers working in the field, as Professor Brandt explains:  The results illustrate the very specific functional organization of our brains. Damage to the areas known as V6 and V6A in the parietal lobe is associated with impaired three-dimensional visual perception. This area of the brain has been studied in primates. However, further research is required to understand its function in humans.  Saarland University Anna-Katharina Schaadt, Stephan A. Brandt, Antje Kraft, Georg Kerkhoff.

While standard chemotherapy drugs damage DNA to stop cancer cells from reproducing, the new method stops the source that creates those cancer cells: genes that are overexpressing certain proteins.  Our study identified miR-182 as a glioblastoma tumor suppressor that reduces the expression of several oncogenes that promote cancer development,  said senior author of the study Alexander Stegh, an assistant professor in the Ken and Ruth Davee department of neurology and of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. The study, published April 2 in Genes and Development, used a nanostructure called spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) to safely deliver miR-182 across the blood-brain barrier to reach tumor cells. There it directly targeted multiple oncogenes at once, increasing cancer cell death and reducing cancer cell growth. SNAs are composed of multiple strands of DNA and RNA densely arranged around a nanoparticle center.  We demonstrate a more specific, more personalized approach to therapy,  Stegh said.  SNAs are a very promising platform to silence the particular genes that drive or contribute to cancer progression in individual patients.  There are 16,000 new cases of the deadly brain tumor reported in the U.S. every year. Patients have a very poor prognosis, with median survival of just 14 to 16 months. The molecule miR-182 is a microRNA, a type of short non-coding RNA that can bind to hundreds of genes to reduce their protein expression in cells. Looking at large-scale genomic datasets, Stegh and colleagues saw that patients with higher levels of miR-182 had a better chance of surviving glioblastoma mulitforme longer. In the study, they found that miR-182 suppressed Bcl2L12, a cancer gene that blocks cancer cell death in response to chemo- and radiation therapy. The microRNA also impeded two other oncogenes, c-Met and HIF2A. The next challenge was establishing a way to get miR-182 to those specific targets. The solution was in SNAs, a structure invented by Northwestern colleague and co-author Chad Mirkin, the George B. Rathmann Professor of Chemistry at the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and a professor of medicine at Feinberg.  We designed a novel delivery method for miR-182 using SNAs,  Stegh said.  Small gold nanoparticles are conjugated with miR-182 sequences. They cross the blood-brain/blood-tumor barrier, and accumulate within brain tumor sites, where they target oncogenes, regulate cell growth and differentiation, reduce tumor burden and prolong survival in our mouse models.  SNAs have unique properties that allow them to reach cells safely without causing toxicity or activating the immune system.  Our approach to gene silencing has not been demonstrated before in such a powerful way for the treatment of brain cancers,  Stegh said.  These particles, microRNA based SNAs, could also potentially be used for gene silencing in other cancers and diseases of genetic origin.  Additional studies will be needed to test miR-182 and the nanoparticle delivery before it becomes an option for patients with glioblastoma mulitforme. But first, Stegh and colleagues want to hone the particle design and to investigate treatments that combine miR-182 with established chemotherapy drugs in mouse models.

Detecting these cells could give doctors a new way to predict whether patients  tumors will metastasize, or monitor how they are responding to treatment, but finding these extremely rare cells has proven challenging because there might be only one to 10 such cells in a 1-milliliter sample of a patient s blood. A team of engineers from MIT, Penn State University, and Carnegie Mellon University is developing a novel way to isolate these cells: using sound waves to separate them from blood cells. Their new cell-sorting device is 20 times faster than the original version that they first reported last year, approaching the speed that would be necessary to make it useful for testing patient blood samples. The researchers have also demonstrated that the device can successfully capture circulating tumor cells from patient samples, which could enable many clinical applications as well as fundamental research on how these cells escape from their original tumor site. Ming Dao, a principal research scientist in MIT s Department of Materials Science and Engineering; Subra Suresh, president of Carnegie Mellon and, at MIT, the Vannevar Bush Professor Emeritus of Engineering and a former dean of engineering; and Tony Jun Huang, a professor of engineering science and mechanics at Penn State, are senior authors of a paper describing the device in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the week of April 6. The research team also includes the lead author, Peng Li, a postdoc at Penn State; Zhangli Peng, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor at the University of Notre Dame; and Joseph Drabick, a professor of medicine at Penn State s Hershey Cancer Institute, among others. Gentle cell separation Most existing cell-sorting technologies require tagging cells with chemicals or exposing them to strong mechanical forces that may damage them. To sort cells using sound waves, which offer a gentler alternative, the researchers built microfluidic devices with two acoustic transducers, which produce sound waves, on either side of a microchannel. When the two waves meet, they combine to form a standing wave (a wave that remains in constant position). This wave produces pressure nodes, or lines of low pressure. Because the sound waves are tilted so they run across the microchannel at an angle, each cell encounters several pressure nodes as it flows through the channel. As cells encounter each node, they are pushed further to the side of the channel; the distance of cell movement depends on their size and other properties, such as compressibility. In the previous study, the researchers were able to separate cancer cells from red and white blood cells, but the sample flow rate through the device was only 1 to 2 microliters per minute. At that rate, it would take more than 50 hours to process a typical patient sample of about 6 milliliters. The new version of the device has a working flow rate about 20 times faster, allowing it to process a patient sample in about five hours. To achieve this, the researchers used computer modeling of cell trajectories, confirmed by experimentation, to adjust some of the device s other features, including the tilting angle   the angle at which the sound waves strike the channel   and the distance over which the cells are exposed to sound waves. Rare cells detected The researchers tested the new acoustic device with samples consisting of a mix of cancer cells and white blood cells grown in the lab. In these studies, they were able to isolate at least 83 percent of the cancer cells from samples that had as few as one cancer cell per 100,000 white blood cells. The device also performed well in tests of blood samples from three breast cancer patients. From those samples, the researchers isolated one, eight, and 59 tumor cells, respectively; the first sample was from a patient who was responding very well to treatment, and therefore had few tumor cells circulating. Their results were similar to those from a commercially available device that can sort cancer cells; however, that device damages cells so they are not viable for further studies, Dao says. In contrast, the acoustic technique is very mild and does not require the cells to be tagged with magnetic beads, antibodies or any other molecules, so they are ideal for further analyses once isolated.  With further improvements in cell throughput, this work could offer a useful new tool, for both basic research into the complex topic of circulating tumor cells and for clinical assessment of different types of cancer,  Suresh says.  The new system s success in sorting patient samples represents a  significant advance  over the team s original device, says Taher Saif, a professor of mechanical science and engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who was not part of the research team.  Now one can imagine a product that could be implemented based on the design they have come up with,  Saif says. The researchers are now working on further improving the device s flow rate, as well as making it more robust and cost-effective.

The simple test developed by University of Central Florida scientist Qun  Treen  Huo holds the promise of earlier detection of one of the deadliest cancers among men. It would also reduce the number of unnecessary and invasive biopsies stemming from the less precise PSA test that s now used.  It s fantastic,  said Dr. Inoel Rivera, a urologic oncologist at Florida Hospital Cancer Institute, which collaborated with Huo on the recent pilot studies.  It s a simple test. It s much better than the test we have right now, which is the PSA, and it s cost-effective.  When a cancerous tumor begins to develop, the body mobilizes to produce antibodies. Huo s test detects that immune response using gold nanoparticles about 10,000 times smaller than a freckle. When a few drops of blood serum from a finger prick are mixed with the gold nanoparticles, certain cancer biomarkers cling to the surface of the tiny particles, increasing their size and causing them to clump together. Among researchers, gold nanoparticles are known for their extraordinary efficiency at absorbing and scattering light. Huo and her team at UCF s NanoScience Technology Center developed a technique known as nanoparticle-enabled dynamic light scattering assay (NanoDLSay) to measure the size of the particles by analyzing the light they throw off. That size reveals whether a patient has prostate cancer and how advanced it may be. And although it uses gold, the test is cheap. A small bottle of nanoparticles suspended in water costs about $250, and contains enough for about 2,500 tests.  What s different and unique about our technique is it s a very simple process, and the material required for the test is less than $1,  Huo said.  And because it s low-cost, we re hoping most people can have this test in their doctor s office. If we can catch this cancer in its early stages, the impact is going to be big.  After lung cancer, prostate cancer is the second-leading killer cancer among men, with more than 240,000 new diagnoses and 28,000 deaths every year. The most commonly used screening tool is the PSA, but it produces so many false-positive results   leading to painful biopsies and extreme treatments   that one of its discoverers recently called it  hardly more effective than a coin toss.  Pilot studies found Huo s technique is significantly more exact. The test determines with 90 to 95 percent confidence that the result is not false-positive. When it comes to false-negatives, there is 50 percent confidence   not ideal, but still significantly higher than the PSA s 20 percent   and Huo is working to improve that number. The results of the pilot studies were published recently in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces. Huo is also scheduled to present her findings in June at the TechConnect World Innovation Summit & Expo in suburban Washington, D.C. Huo s team is pursuing more extensive clinical validation studies with Florida Hospital and others, including the VA Medical Center Orlando. She hopes to complete major clinical trials and see the test being used by physicians in two to three years. Huo also is researching her technique s effectiveness as a screening tool for other tumors.  Potentially, we could have a universal screening test for cancer,  she said.  Our vision is to develop an array of blood tests for early detection and diagnosis of all major cancer types, and these blood tests are all based on the same technique and same procedure.  Huo co-founded Nano Discovery Inc., a startup company headquartered in a UCF Business Incubator, to commercialize the new diagnostic test. The company manufacturers a test device specifically for medical research and diagnostic purposes.","Published: April 7, 2015"

The traditional test used by the NHS to identify kidney dysfunction, measures the level of a waste product (Creatinine), which is only raised when up to 60% of the kidney has already been damaged.  This damage is irreversible, with dialysis or transplant the only available therapies. As kidney disease progresses, waste builds up in the blood which can have a significant impact on other key areas of the body; impairing heart health, weakening bones, reducing immune response and damaging the central nervous system.  If left unchecked, CKD can cause kidney failure and death. With early detection, the progression of CKD can be prevented; in response to this the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, has drafted new guidance for doctors to improve diagnosis and identify kidney dysfunction in the earliest stages.  The health watchdog makes it clear that a highly sensitive test for the biomarker Cystatin C, should be used alongside the traditional creatinine test, for more accurate and earlier identification of kidney function deterioration. Cystatin C is a protein produced by the body at a constant rate, its small molecular weight allows it to be completely broken down and removed by the kidneys; levels therefore, remain steady if the kidneys are working efficiently and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is normal.  If kidney function deteriorates, Cystatin C concentrations rise.   Testing for cystatin c means doctors can pick up on even the smallest changes in GFR, identifying a drop in kidney function at the earliest opportunity.  Once a problem has been spotted early it can be managed through medication and/or changes to diet and lifestyle, preventing chronic kidney disease from occurring. Around 2 million adults in England have CKD   but as it is largely asymptomatic and often undiagnosed, it is thought a further 1 million could also be suffering from the advanced stages of the disease.  Dr Gilbert Wieringa, Consultant Biochemist at Bolton NHS Foundation Trust, a keen advocate of the test commented:   I welcome the fact that NICE now recognises Cystatin C as a key biomarker in the differential diagnosis of CKD. The ready availability of this blood test ensures the right treatment can be started for the right patient in the right time in turn helping to prevent or delay progression of CKD, reducing or delaying complications, and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. It provides a key example where investment in a diagnostic test helps reduce far greater cost burdens of managing secondary complications further down the line  NICE says that while using the cystatin c test will increase the cost of diagnosis  accuracy is expected to improve and fewer people are expected to require treatment and monitoring .   Dr Peter FitzGerald, MD at UK Biotech firm Randox, which has created a cystatin C test for use in every standard hospital lab in the UK, believes the new diagnostic method could have a significant impact on the financial burden of CKD on the NHS:   CKD is closely linked with diabetes, obesity, stoke and cardio vascular disease   as we see these conditions increase across the UK, so too will the prevalence of CKD, but if we can catch kidney function damage early, we can prevent CKD and prevent the need for expensive medical interventions such as dialysis, the cost of which per patient, per year is around  31,000. Needless to say, it also comes at considerable personal expense, but this does not have to be the way.  NICE estimates that up to 20% of the current CKD population may not have needed medication, if the new testing method was introduced and says  savings are expected at a local level as a result of this change.

This finding, published in Nature, is expected to help make the CRISPR toolbox accessible for in vivo experimental and therapeutic applications. Originally discovered in bacteria, the CRISPR-Cas9 system enables the cutting of DNA as a defense mechanism against viral infection. Although numerous microbial species possess this system, the Cas9 enzyme from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) was the first to be engineered for altering the DNA of higher organisms, and has since emerged as the basis for a series of highly versatile genome modification technologies. In order to perturb genes in adult animals, key components of the CRISPR-Cas9 system must be introduced into cells using delivery vehicles known as vectors. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is considered one of the most promising candidate vectors, as it is not known to cause human disease and has already gained clinical regulatory approval in Europe. However, the small cargo capacity of AAV makes it challenging to package both the SpCas9 enzyme and the other components required for gene editing into a single viral particle. The Cas9 nuclease from the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9), presented in this new work, is 25% smaller than SpCas9, offering a solution to the AAV packaging problem. The Broad/MIT team, led by Feng Zhang, core member of the Broad Institute and investigator at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, along with collaborators at MIT, led by MIT Institute Professor Phillip Sharp, and the NCBI led by Eugene Koonin, set out to identify smaller Cas9 enzymes that could replicate the efficiency of the current SpCas9 system, while allowing packaging into delivery vehicles such as AAV. The researchers began by using comparative genomics to analyze Cas9s from more than 600 different types of bacteria, selecting six smaller enzymes for further study.  Sifting through the 600 or so available Cas9 sequences, we identified a group of small variants in which the enzymatic domains were intact whereas the non-enzymatic portion was substantially truncated,  said Eugene Koonin, senior investigator with the NCBI and a contributing author of the study.  Luckily, one of these smaller Cas9 proteins turned out to be suitable for the development of the methodology described in this paper. We are now actively exploring the diversity of Cas9 proteins and their relatives in the hope to find new varieties that could potentially lead to even more powerful tools.  After rigorous testing, only the Cas9 from S. aureus demonstrated DNA cutting efficiency comparable to that of SpCas9 in mammalian cells. The team then used a method known as BLESS, previously developed by Nicola Crosetto of the Karolinska Institute and Ivan Dikic at the Goethe University Medical School, to determine the presence of unintended  off-targets  across the entire genomic space. Again, SaCas9 and SpCas9 demonstrated comparable DNA targeting accuracy. The team demonstrated the power of in vivo gene editing with AAV/SaCas9-mediated targeting of PCSK9, a promising drug target. The loss of PCSK9 in humans has been associated with the reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and lower levels of LDL cholesterol. In a mouse model, the team observed almost complete depletion of PCKS9 in the blood one week after administration of AAV/SaCas9 and a 40% decrease in total cholesterol. The mice showed no overt signs of inflammation or immune response.  While we have chosen a therapeutically relevant target, PCSK9, in this proof-of-principle study, the greater goal here is the development of a versatile and efficient system that expands our ability to edit genomes in vivo,  said Fei Ann Ran, co-first author of the study, along with Le Cong and Winston Yan. More broadly, SaCas9 is expected improve scientists  ability to screen for the effects of mutations and better understand gene function using animal models. In the future, it may also be engineered to allow the targeted control of gene expression, which can be employed to expand our understanding of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation in the cell. The next step, says senior author Feng Zhang, is to compare and contrast the two Cas9s in the hope of recognizing ways to further optimize the system.  This study highlights the power of using comparative genome analysis to expand the CRISPR-Cas9 toolbox,  said Zhang.  Our long-term goal is to develop CRISPR as a therapeutic platform. This new Cas9 provides a scaffold to expand our Cas9 repertoire, and help us create better models of disease, identify mechanisms, and develop new treatments. ","Published: April 7, 2015"

Novel mechanism behind Alzheimer s-related circadian rhythm disruptions Alzheimer s disease (AD), a progressive and highly disruptive neurodegenerative condition, leads to a severe decrease in cognitive capabilities. Though the root cause of AD is unclear, it is known that increased levels of amyloid- a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) are associated with development of the disease. Additionally, disruptions of sleep cycles are known to occur in AD patients, with increased sleep activity during daytime and increased wakefulness at night. These sleep disruptions suggest a link between the circadian clock and AD pathogenesis.   Clues found into cognitive dysfunction in chronic fatigue syndrome Scientists at Columbia University s Mailman School of Public Health have identified a unique pattern of immune molecules in the cerebrospinal fluid of people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) that provides insights into the basis for cognitive dysfunction frequently described by patients as  brain fog as well as new hope for improvements in diagnosis and treatment.   Depression often co-occurs with joint diseases Those suffering from depressive symptoms have an increased risk for physical diseases, especially for arthrosis and arthritis. These findings were reported by researchers from the University of Basel and the Ruhr-University Bochum. Their results, based on data from 14,300 people living in Switzerland, have been published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health.   Migrating immune cells promote nerve cell demise in the brain The slow death of dopamine-producing nerve cells in a certain region of the brain is the principal cause underlying Parkinson's disease. In mice, it is possible to simulate the symptoms of this disease using a substance that selectively kills dopamine-producing neurons. Scientists from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) have now shown for the first time in mouse experiments that after this treatment, cells of the peripheral immune system migrate from the bloodstream into the brain, where they play a major role in the death of neurons. The investigators were able to reduce the level of neurodegeneration using a substance that blocks a specific surface molecule on these inflammatory cells.

But a new study shows there's also good news from up in the aspens and pines: The prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) decreases substantially as altitude increases. In Utah, for example, an analysis of information from two national health surveys correlated with the average state elevation of 6,100 feet showed that the rate of diagnosed ADHD cases is about 50 percent of states at sea level. In Salt Lake City, whose elevation is about 4,300 feet, diagnosed ADHD prevalence is approximately 38 percent less than at sea level. One potential reason for the decreased rate of ADHD, University of Utah researchers believe, is higher levels of dopamine produced as a reaction to hypobaric hypoxia -- a condition caused when people breathe air with less oxygen at higher elevations. Decreased dopamine levels are associated with ADHD so when levels of the chemical increase with elevation, the risk for getting the disorder diminishes. There are other potential reasons for the disparities in the rates of the disorder, such as regional inconsistencies in diagnosing ADHD. The study findings, published online in the Journal of Attention Disorders, have important implications for potentially treating ADHD, according to Douglas G. Kondo, M.D., assistant professor of psychiatry and senior author on the study. ""Our previous studies of mood disorders and suicide consistently suggest that hypobaric hypoxia associated with altitude may serve as a kind of environmental stressor,"" Kondo says. ""But these results raise the question of whether, in the case of ADHD, altitude may be a protective factor."" Rebekah Huber, a doctoral candidate in educational psychology at the University of Utah, is the first author. Huber works in the research group of Perry F. Renshaw, M.D., Ph.D., M.B.A., a University of Utah professor of psychiatry, USTAR investigator and a co-author on the study. Huber, Kondo, Renshaw and their colleagues conducted the study with data from two national health surveys and information on average state elevations taken from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. The National Survey on Children's Health contacted 91,642 households in 2007 and found that 73,123 children ages 4-17 had been diagnosed with mild, moderate or severe ADHD by a physician or other health care provider. The 2010 National Survey of Children with Special Healthcare Needs contacted 372,689 households and found that 40,242 children in that age range had been diagnosed with full ADHD. The researchers correlated the number of cases of diagnosed ADHD with average elevations in the lower 48 states and the District of Columbia as reported by the federal agencies to determine rates of ADHD. From this, they derived data on ADHD rates at sea level and above and found that for every 1-foot increase in elevation, the likelihood of being diagnosed with ADHD by a healthcare provider decreases by .001 percent. The data showed that North Carolina, whose average elevation is 869 feet above sea level, had the highest percentage of children diagnosed with ADHD -- 15.6 percent. Delaware, Louisiana and Alabama -- all states with an average elevation of less than 1,000 feet -- followed closely behind North Carolina with high percentages of ADHD. Nevada -- with an average elevation of 5,517 feet above sea level -- had the lowest percentage at 5.6. Utah had one of the lowest rates of ADHD, 6.7 percent. All of the Mountain West states rated well below average for the percentage of children diagnosed with ADHD. The study also took into account other factors -- such as birth weight, ethnicity, and sex (males are more likely to have ADHD) -- that could affect ADHD diagnoses and influence the rate of the disorder in each state. This study follows research in which Renshaw and colleagues at the University of Utah and in South Korea showed correlations between increased rates of suicide and depression with higher altitudes. The decrease in ADHD at elevation doesn't mean people need to start moving to the mountains, according to Renshaw. But the research results do have potential implications for treating the disorder. ""To treat ADHD we very often give someone medication that increases dopamine,"" he says. ""Does this mean we should be increasing medications that target dopamine?

The team demonstrated that the drug, saracatinib, restores memory loss and reverses brain problems in mouse models of Alzheimer s, and now the researchers are testing saracatinib s effectiveness in humans. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health as part of an innovative crowdsourcing initiative to repurpose experimental drugs. Researchers from the Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, conducted the animal study, published for early view on March 21 in the Annals of Neurology External Web Site Policy, with support from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) through its Discovering New Therapeutic Uses for Existing Molecules (New Therapeutic Uses) program. Launched in May 2012, this program matches scientists with a selection of pharmaceutical industry assets that have undergone significant research and development by industry, including safety testing in humans, to test potential ideas for new therapeutic uses. Alzheimer s disease is the most common form of dementia, a group of disorders that cause progressive loss of memory and other mental processes. An estimated 5 million Americans have Alzheimer s disease, which causes clumps of amyloid beta protein to build up in the brain, and these protein clusters damage and ultimately kill brain cells (neurons). Alzheimer s disease also leads to loss of synapses, which are the spaces between neurons through which the cells talk to each other and form memories. Current Alzheimer s drug therapies can only ease symptoms without stopping disease progression. New treatments are needed that can halt the condition by targeting its underlying mechanisms. Through NCATS  New Therapeutic Uses program, Yale neurobiology researcher, neurologist and senior author of the study Stephen Strittmatter, M.D., Ph.D., and his colleagues obtained saracatinib (AZD0530), which the biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca previously developed to treat cancer. Strittmatter and his team knew from previous studies that a protein called Fyn kinase plays a central role in how amyloid beta clusters damage brain cells. Saracatinib targets the same Fyn protein and already had cleared several key steps in the development process, giving Strittmatter s team a critical head start on the research.  The investigational drug already had been developed, optimized and studied in animals as well as tested for safety in humans, so our ability to obtain this asset through NCATS and AstraZeneca gave us an incredible shortcut in the drug development process,  Strittmatter explained. Typically, drug development can take at least a decade from the discovery of a therapeutic target to an experimental compound s entry into a Phase 2a human clinical trial to test effectiveness. In the case of saracatinib, the research team completed required preclinical and clinical safety studies and began a Phase 2a trial within about 18 months.  This work demonstrates what can happen when NIH, the biopharmaceutical industry and academia innovate and collaborate to share resources and knowledge,  said NCATS Director Christopher P. Austin, M.D.  The speed with which this compound moved to human trials validates our New Therapeutic Uses program model and serves NCATS  mission to deliver more treatments to more patients more quickly.   No one individual or group has complete knowledge of disease pathways and treatment targets,  said Craig D. Wegner, Ph.D., head, Boston Emerging Innovations Unit, Scientific Partnering & Alliances within AstraZeneca s Innovative Medicines and Early Development Biotech Unit.  This program enabled us to pair AstraZeneca s data on this compound with the Strittmatter group s specialized Alzheimer s disease knowledge to uncover a potential new therapeutic use for saracatinib. It s a great example of how scientists from industry and academia can synergistically work together to push the boundaries of medical science.  In the animal study, the Yale team gave the experimental drug to mice with Alzheimer s-like symptoms, such as memory loss and age-related buildup of abnormal amyloid beta clusters, modeling the development of the disease in humans. After four weeks, the Alzheimer s mice showed complete reversal of spatial learning and memory loss. When the scientists examined the brains of the mice, they found that the characteristic synapse loss had been fully restored, providing a biological explanation for the memory improvement. The treatment also reduced several other Alzheimer s-related biochemical changes in the mice and did not appear to be toxic. Already, the Yale scientists have completed a successful Phase 1b safety trial in humans with Alzheimer s disease (NCT01864655). Now the team is enrolling more participants in a larger, multisite Phase 2a trial (NCT02167256) to assess safety, tolerability and effectiveness of the experimental compound. A total of 152 participants will receive saracatinib or placebo for one year, and the researchers expect to have final results within two years. Individuals interested in participating in the trial can find more information at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02167256?term=Alzheimer+AND+Fyn&rank=2. Both human trials were funded by the New Therapeutic Uses program (Phase 1b: 1UH2TR000967-01; Phase 2a: 4UH3TR000967-02). The Phase 2a study will take place at multiple clinical sites as part of the Alzheimer s Disease Cooperative Study External Web Site Policy, an initiative for multisite clinical studies sponsored by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) to facilitate the development and testing of new therapeutics for the condition.","Published: April 4, 2015"

ECR will provide analytical microscopes for conducting analyses of various engine components. The company develops and builds Chevrolet engines for numerous NASCAR Sprint Cup, XFINITY Series and Camping World Truck Series teams, including RCR s seven full-time teams. ECR is using the latest ZEISS EVO MA25 scanning electron microscope (SEM) for material analysis studies, the ZEISS SteREO Discovery.V20 stereo microscope and the ZEISS Smartzoom 5 digital microscope for imaging larger parts, and a confocal light microscope for measuring surface roughness and 3D-topographical characterization.  We are proud of this new partnership with ZEISS, the leader of the microscopy industry,  said Jim Suth, Quality Manager and Engineer for ECR.  Having access to the latest advanced, analytical technology from ZEISS will be an asset and provide us a distinct advantage that will undoubtedly translate to success on the race track.  ECR, which manufactures engines at its Welcome, NC campus, will use the microscopes for quality control, research and development, and failure analysis work. Data obtained by using these analytical tools will allow engineers to be completely confident in their decision making on both new part acceptance and failed part corrective actions. The work is being carried out as part of the company s ongoing implementation of cleaner components, stronger raw materials and higher performing lubricants. Engineers have found that ever-increasing demands on engines for power and fuel economy places greater pressure on various critical engine components, which can cause premature wear and/or fatigue. Occurrences of premature wear and fatigue can lead to catastrophic failure, resulting in the race team having to exit the race. ECR will use the newest version of ZEISS EVO MA25 to study these different types of component wear and material fatigue. The SEM is equipped with ZEISS SmartBrowse software for particle analysis and report generation. As an essential part of the EVO workflow, ZEISS SmartBrowse provides an interactive map of the entire sample. By providing in-context visualization of all optical and SEM images in data layers, ZEISS SmartBrowse greatly improves post image analysis and provides an innovative and striking data review method. For macro scale imaging, failure analysis of larger parts, and sample preparation for electron microscopy, ECR will also utilize ZEISS SteREO Discovery.V20 light microscope. Using ZEISS  correlative microscopy solution, images collected with the stereo microscope can be easily translated to ZEISS EVO MA25 for precise overlay with electron microscopy data. This imaging capability saves time usually spent locating points of interest under the electron microscope s high magnification. Also available is a ZEISS confocal light microscope, which provides quantitative measurements of surface finishes for studying associated friction and wear of internal engine components.","Published: April 4, 2015"

UT Southwestern researchers identified how a combination of signaling molecules inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells, improving clinical outcomes for some subtypes of breast cancers. The combination - the steroid hormone estradiol and the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF ) - act to expand the number of sites where estrogen receptor alpha (ER ) can bind to the genome in breast cancer cells. The new sites of ER  binding turn new genes on and off, which alters the growth response of the breast cancer cells, inhibiting their growth and improving clinical outcomes in certain cases. The newly identified gene set can be used as a biomarker that can help physicians determine who is at risk and how they might react to certain therapies.  Our study uncovered the molecular mechanisms that alter the expression of the new set of genes in response to estradiol and TNF , and identified potential target genes for future therapy,  said senior author Dr. W. Lee Kraus, Director of the Cecil H. and Ida Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.  Since the altered pattern of gene expression can predict outcomes in breast cancer, there are important diagnostic and prognostic implications.  Approximately 12.3 percent of women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point during their lifetime, and nearly 2.9 million women are living with breast cancer in the United States, according to statistics from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). About 232,670 new cases were reported in 2014, constituting about 14 percent of all new cancer cases. About 40,000 deaths were attributed to breast cancer in 2014. Cancer cells release signals that can prompt the body to respond with an inflammatory response. As part of this response, TNF  is released and can impact the growth of the cancer cells. Previous studies suggested that inflammation might exacerbate the cancer, while the present study suggests that, in some cases, it might actually promote a better outcome. The study revealed that, when present together, TNF  and estradiol cause ER , a nuclear transcription factor that is present in about two-thirds of breast cancers (so-called ER+ cancers), to bind to new sites in the genome where the protein does not bind with either TNF  or estradiol alone. These new ER  binding sites allow altered gene expression and, for some subtypes of breast cancers, inhibit the growth of cancer cells. Since the effect only happens when the two are combined, researchers can use the altered gene expression patterns as an indicator that both agents are at work in the cancer and as a biomarker that may help determine who might be more at risk and how they might react to therapy, said Dr. Kraus, Professor and Vice Chair for Basic Sciences in Obstetrics and Gynecology, Professor of Pharmacology, and holder of the Cecil H. and Ida Green Distinguished Chair in Reproductive Biology Sciences. The mission of the Cecil H. and Ida Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences, endowed by Cecil and Ida Green in 1974, is to promote and support cutting-edge, integrative, and collaborative basic research in female reproductive biology, with a focus on signaling, gene regulation, and genome function.","Published: April 4, 2015"

Using an FDA approved substance for treating stomach cancer, Rehen and colleagues were able to grow dopamine-producing neurons derived from embryonic stem cells that remained healthy and functional for as long as 15 months after implantation into mice, restoring motor function without forming tumors. Parkinson's, which affect as many 10 million people in the world, is caused by a depletion of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Current treatments include medications and electrical implants in the brain which causes severe adverse effects over time and fail to prevent disease progression. Several studies have indicated that the transplantation of embryonic stem cells improves motor functions in animal models. However, until now, the procedure has shown to be unsafe, because of the risk of tumors upon transplantation. To address this issue, the researchers tested for the first time to pre-treat undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells with mitomycin C, a drug already prescribed to treat cancer. The substance blocks the DNA replication and prevents the cells to multiply out of control. The researchers used mice modeled for Parkinson's. The animals were separated in three groups. The first one, the control group, did not receive the stem cell implant. The second one, received the implant of stem cells which were not treated with mitomycin C and the third one received the mitomycin C treated cells. After the injection of 50,000 untreated stem cells, the animals of the second group showed improvement in motor functions but all of them died between 3 and 7 weeks later. These animals also developed intracerebral tumors. In contrast, animals receiving the treated stem cells showed improvement of Parkinson's symptoms and survived until the end of the observation period of 12 weeks post-transplant with no tumors detected. Four of these mice were monitored for as long as 15 months with no signs of pathology. Furthermore, the scientists have also shown that treating the stem cells with mitomycin C induced a four-fold increase in the release of dopamine after in vitro differentiation. ""This simple strategy of shortly exposing pluripotent stem cells to an anti-cancer drug turned the transplant safer, by eliminating the risk of tumor formation,"" says the leader of the study Stevens Rehen, Professor at UFRJ and researcher at IDOR. The discovery, reported in the journal Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience, could pave the way for researchers and physicians to propose a clinical trial using pluripotent stem cells treated with mitomycin C prior to transplant to treat Parkinson's patients and also other neurodegenerative conditions.

But the mechanism by which we judge how far away that sound is coming from was a mystery until now. Researchers from UConn Health (University of Connecticut) report in the Journal of Neuroscience that echoes and fluctuations in volume (amplitude modulation) are the cues we use to figure the distance between us and the source of a noise.  This opens up a new horizon,  says Duck O. Kim, a neuroscientist at UConn Health. Researchers have long understood how we can tell a sound s direction  whether it s to our left or right, front or back, and above or below us. But how we tell how far away it is had remained a mystery.  The third dimension of sound location was pretty much unknown,  says Kim. All natural sounds, including speech, have amplitude modulation. Kim and his colleague Shigeyuki Kuwada, also a neuroscience researcher, suspected that amplitude modulation, and how echoes muddy it, were together key to the ability to perceive a sound s distance. To explore the idea, they used tiny microphones to record the sounds inside rabbits  ears as they played sounds at different locations. They used these recordings to simulate modulated or unmodulated noise coming from different distances away from the rabbit. Then Kim and Kuwada played the simulated sounds back to the rabbit, and measured the responses of neurons in the rabbit s inferior colliculus (IC), a region of the midbrain known to be important for sound perception. When the rabbit heard the simulated sounds, certain types of IC neurons fired more when the sound was closer and the depth of modulation was higher   that is, when there was a bigger difference between the sound s maximum and minimum amplitude. Reverberations, or echoes, tend to degrade amplitude modulation, smoothing out the amplitude s peaks and valleys. Almost any environment has echoes, as sounds bounce off objects, walls and trees, the ground, et cetera. The farther away the source of a sound is from a listener, the more echoes there are, and the more degraded the depth of amplitude modulation becomes. As expected, in the experiment the neurons fired less and less when the sound moved farther away and the depth of amplitude modulation degraded more and more. Pavel Zahorik, an auditory researcher at the University of Louisville School of Medicine, tested the same amplitude-modulated noise using human volunteers and got the same results: people need both amplitude modulation and reverberation to figure out how far away a sound is. Without amplitude modulation, a person can t tell how far away that noise is. Neither can she do it in an anechoic (echo-free) room.  Reverberation is usually considered a bad thing,  detrimental to hearing clearly, says Kuwada.  But it is necessary and beneficial in order to recognize distance.  Judging sound distance is a crucial survival skill, whether you re a bunny or a human   is that monster breathing down my neck, or huffing and puffing 20 yards behind me? Do I have time to cross the street before that car I hear in the distance pulls around the bend? Kim and Kuwada suggest that getting a better understanding of the acoustics and neuroscience of distance perception could contribute to making better hearing aids and prostheses, and perhaps reveal more subtle aspects of sound perception. The importance of amplitude modulation is still poorly understood. Laurel Carney, a colleague at the University of Rochester, modeled the ear and inferior colliculus neural circuitry and replicated the neural firing patterns recorded by Kim and Kuwada. The researchers hope that tweaking the model will give them more insight into the neurons  responses. Kim and Kuwada s next step will be to do a two-eared study, and tie together the perception of distance with horizontal and vertical directions of sound.

The finding, reported in the journal American Journal of Human Genetics, may help scientists unravel the complex biological mechanism behind these diseases. ""These findings allow us to open up what was, up to this point, a 'black box' and more fully understand the biological pathways associated with these disorders and why some individuals do not respond to treatment,"" said Alex Paciorkowski, M.D., an assistant professor of Neurology at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) and lead author of the study. Epileptic seizures are the result of bursts of electrical activity in the brain caused when groups of neurons fire in an abnormal pattern. The study focuses on a severe form of seizure disorders -- early myoclonic encephalopathy, Ohtahara syndrome, and infantile spasms -- collectively referred to as developmental epilepsies. These seizures appear early in life, in some instances hours after birth, and can be fatal. Individuals with the condition who survive beyond infancy will often struggle for the rest of their lives will developmental disabilities, autism, and uncontrollable seizures. The researchers analyzed the genetic profiles of 101 individuals with developmental epilepsy and were able to identify a mutation in a gene called salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1), a gene previously unidentified with the disease and one which the researchers believe plays a role in a chain reaction of gene and protein interactions in neurons that contribute to seizures. The link between the SIK1 mutation and developmental epilepsy was made possible through the intersection of genetics, neurobiology, and high performance computing. In the latter case, the researchers utilized a supercomputer cluster at the University of Rochester that allowed the scientists to sift through enormous sets of genetic information quickly and more efficiently. ""High performance computational capabilities were key to this research and enabled us to analyze essentially the full genetic profile -- more than 20,000 genes -- for each study subject and simultaneously compare the results with data from other families,"" said Paciorkowski. ""In the past, this type of analysis would have taken months of computing time to accomplish. We can now get results in a matter of days."" Once the mutation was identified, the researchers worked with neurobiologists in the URMC lab of Marc Halterman, M.D., Ph.D., and were able to identify the downstream impact of the mutation, namely that it regulated another gene that has been associated with severe seizures called myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C). While the biological chain of events caused by the mutation is not fully understood, the researchers believe that malfunctioning SIK1 and MEF2C genes interfere with the cellular machinery in neurons that that are responsible for guiding proper development, namely, the growth, maintenance, and maturation of synapses, the connections that allow neurons to communicate with their neighbors. Using an array of experiments, including in brain tissue from an affected individual, Paciorkowski and colleagues showed that the proteins created by the mutated SIK1 did not behave normally. In healthy cells, the proteins eventually make their way from the cytoplasm into the cell's nucleus and, once there, help ""instruct"" the cell to carry out specific functions. The researchers observed that the proteins created by mutated SIK1 genes remained stuck in the cytoplasm. While the finding sheds light on the biological mechanisms of these diseases, it may also guide treatment in the near future. The primary drug used to treat developmental epilepsy is adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). However, the drug is ineffective in about 40 percent of cases. ACTH is also very expensive and has significant, including life-threatening, side effects. The hormone is known to regulate SIK1 levels. The new finding may enable researchers to better identify which individuals are more likely to benefit from the treatment.

The licensed intellectual property is the result of many years of research and collaboration between renowned cannabinoid scientists, Raphael Mechoulam, Professor of medicinal chemistry, and Ruth Gallily, Professor of immunology, both from the Hebrew University; the distinguished immunologist, Professor Sir Marc Feldman, Director of the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology; and prominent physicians and scientists at Hadassah Professors Chaim Lotan and Ronen Durst, and Dr. Lola Weiss. Yaacov Michlin, Chief Executive Officer of Yissum, stated:  We are very pleased with this business collaboration, which is a result of many years of multi-disciplinary cooperation between distinguished scientists in the field of CBD chemistry and biology, together with leading clinicians and researchers in the area of diabetes, cardiovascular disorders and inflammation diseases. We are confident that ISA Scientific is the right partner to translate these academic accomplishments into CBD treatments that will benefit patients worldwide.   ISA Scientific is pleased to be collaborating with Yissum, Hadasit and KIR in making the human therapeutic use of CBD a reality,  said Mark J. Rosenfeld, M.S., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of ISA Scientific.  The licensing agreement is very well timed because our Phase 1 clinical trials on dosing and safety are now underway in Israel, and arrangements for Phase 2 trials on treating diabetes and neuropathic pain are in process. It is important to recognize that very little CBD usually gets into the bloodstream when it is taken by mouth, and this inefficiency is a major obstacle to making oral CBD medicines with consistent dosing and reliable therapeutic outcomes. ISA Scientific has uniquely resolved this key problem with proprietary drug delivery technology now being integrated into our clinical trials. Besides maximizing the therapeutic utility of ISA Scientific s CBD formulations, this technology also helps reduce production costs and thus the price of medicine to patients.   The licensed technology encompasses diabetes and other disorders of immense public health relevance, and these are impacting hundreds of millions of people around the world. That there is tremendous demand for alternatives to more successfully treat these diseases is an understatement. What ISA Scientific is doing to make efficient and affordable CBD medicine will prove eminently valuable in that regard. ","Published: April 3, 2015"

A report of the study, conducted in animals by researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine, appears online in the journal Neurobiology of Disease.  These findings are an important contribution to our understanding of the alcohol-induced brain changes that make alcohol problems in adulthood more likely among young people who abuse alcohol,  said NIAAA Director George F. Koob, Ph.D. Previous studies have shown that people who start drinking before the age of 15 are four times more likely to meet the criteria for alcohol dependence at some point in their lives, and young people consume more than 90 percent of their alcohol by binge drinking. Researchers led by Subhash C. Pandey, Ph.D., professor of psychiatry and director of neuroscience alcoholism research at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a Research Career Scientist at Jesse Brown Veteran Affairs Medical Center in Chicago, investigated the effects of intermittent binge alcohol exposure during the adolescent stage of development in rats. To model adolescent binge-drinking in humans, the researchers gave 28-day-old rats alcohol for two days in a row, followed by two days off, and repeated this pattern for 13 days. Some rats were followed into adulthood and observed for abnormal behaviors. They were offered both alcohol and water, and their alcohol-drinking behavior was monitored. Rats exposed to alcohol during adolescence exhibited changes in behavior that lasted into adulthood, long after their adolescent binge exposure to alcohol had ended. For example, they showed increased anxiety-like behaviors and drank more alcohol in adulthood. Prior research has implicated a brain structure known as the amygdala in anxiety and alcohol-drinking behaviors. When Dr. Pandey and his colleagues analyzed the amygdala of alcohol-exposed rats in their study, they found that the complex of DNA and histone proteins within the amygdala cell nuclei appeared to be tightly wrapped. They also found increased levels of a protein called HDAC2, which modifies histones in a way that causes DNA to be wound tighter around them. Collectively, these kinds of changes to DNA or its associated proteins that change its function but do not affect the DNA sequence are referred to as epigenetic changes.  Genes that lie within DNA that is tightly wrapped around the histones are less active than they are if the DNA is loosely wrapped,  explains Dr. Pandey.  The looser the DNA is coiled, the more accessible are the genes to the cellular machinery that makes relevant proteins.  Dr. Pandey and his team found that the epigenetic changes they observed in alcohol-exposed rats were linked to lowered expression of two genes - brain-derived neurotrophic factor and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated - that nerve cells need to form new connections with each other. The diminished expression of the genes persisted in adulthood, even if alcohol exposure was stopped weeks before, and the researchers observed diminished nerve connectivity in the amygdala of these affected adult rats. But they then showed that a drug that blocks the activity of HDAC2 could loosen the coiling of DNA in amygdala cell nuclei of alcohol-exposed rats, and increased the expression of the gene needed for nerve cell connectivity in those animals. The animals then also exhibited less anxiety and reduced alcohol intake. The researchers plan additional studies of this target and other epigenetic drugs to investigate their possible use in reversing the persistent harmful effects of adolescent alcohol exposure.","Published: April 3, 2015"

The powerful new tool may help researchers better explain why some people get sick and others do not despite being the same age and weight, or having the same bad habits (e.g. smoking). Researchers have long sought to determine these risks by looking at diet and variations in nuclear genes inherited from both parents. These analyses have left out differences in mitochondrial genes (mtDNA), the second kind of DNA in every cell, which we inherit from our mothers. Research in recent years revealed that miscues in mitochondrial energy production can cause several diseases. Determining the contribution of variations in mtDNA to a person s disease risk is complicated by heteroplasmy, where DNA in different sets of mitochondria across many cells, randomly change over time, resulting in slightly different DNA code, and so a differing genetic component of risk. The Mount Sinai study developed the sequencing technology, called Mseek, which helped accurately identify heteroplasmy in a person s mtDNA for the first time. Past efforts in this regard had been hindered by the very small amounts mtDNA in each cell. Studies had documented heteroplasmy, but none had established it conclusively at the single cell level. ""Researchers have struggled to sequence mtDNA accurately and in a cost effective manner,"" said Ravi Sachidanandam, PhD, Assistant Professor, Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. ""The technique we have developed will allow us to identify dysfunction within mitochondria and makes mtDNA a useful biomarker as well as a potential therapeutic target in cancer and many inherited diseases."" Dr. Sachidanandam said the new technology shows unprecedented sensitivity, specificity and sequencing depths. It also has the ability to yield highly pure mtDNA and to detect different versions of mtDNA code or variants. The Mseek technique uses enzymes to purify mitochondrial DNA by deleting the nuclear DNA, leaving behind the pure mitochondrial DNA to be sequenced. By applying Mseek to several cell lines, researchers identified mtDNA ""fingerprints"" in each cell sample. Additionally, they established that heteroplasmy is stably maintained at a single-cell level over multiple divisions by tracking mtDNA variants. ""We hypothesized that heteroplasmy could be stabilized by intercellular exchange of mtDNA,"" said Sachidanandam. ""Our results demonstrated the exchange of mtDNA is possible and heteroplasmy can be maintained stably through this mechanism. This technique could provide a novel platform to investigate features of heteroplasmy in normal and diseased state and in the future, the exchange mechanism could be used as a treatment that targets bad mtDNA and exchanges it with good mtDNA.""","Published: April 3, 2015"

To detect food allergies, physicians typically use skin prick tests or blood tests that measure levels of allergen-specific IgE (sIgE), a protein made by the immune system. However, these tests cannot predict the severity of allergic reactions. Oral food challenges, in which specific allergens are given to patients to ingest under physician supervision to test for signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction, remain the gold standard for diagnosing food allergy even though the tests themselves can trigger severe reactions. In the newly published study, Mount Sinai researchers from The Mindich Child Health and Development Institute and the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute report that by counting the numbers of one type of immune cell activated by exposure to a food, a simple, safe blood test can accurately predict the severity of each person s allergic reaction to it. The immune cell measured is the basophil, and the blood test, the basophil activation test or BAT, requires only a small blood sample and provides quick results.  While providing crucial information about their potential for a severe allergic reaction to a food, having blood drawn for BAT testing is a much more comfortable procedure than food challenges.  says first author Ying Song, MD.  Although food challenges are widely practiced, they carry the risk of severe allergic reactions, and we believe BAT testing will provide accurate information in a safer manner,  says Dr. Song, also a researcher in the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at The Mount Sinai Hospital.  Although the blood basophil activation test has been shown to be an important addition to the tools available for discriminating between allergic and non-allergic individuals and predicting the severity of food allergy reactions, at this time it is only approved for research purposes,  says senior author Xiu-Min Li, MD, Professor of Pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine. Investigators took blood samples from 67 patients, ages 12 to 45 years, who also underwent a food challenge with a placebo or with peanut, tree nut, fish, shellfish, or sesame. The goal was to see if the BAT test results would correlate with food challenge results. The study was double blinded, so neither researchers nor patients knew which person received a placebo or one of the allergens, which were administered at random. Before the randomized food challenge, researchers collected blood from all patients and analyzed the results, which showed a strong correlation between BAT testing data and food challenge severity scores. This finding provides evidence that BAT testing can reduce the need for food challenges not only for peanut, but also for tree nut, fish, shellfish, and sesame and perhaps for other foods.","Published: April 3, 2015"

While standard chemotherapy drugs damage DNA to stop cancer cells from reproducing, the new method stops the source that creates those cancer cells: genes that are overexpressing certain proteins. ""Our study identified miR-182 as a glioblastoma tumor suppressor that reduces the expression of several oncogenes that promote cancer development,"" said senior author of the study Alexander Stegh, an assistant professor in the Ken and Ruth Davee department of neurology and of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. The study, published in Genes and Development, used a nanostructure called spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) to safely deliver miR-182 across the blood-brain barrier to reach tumor cells. There it directly targeted multiple oncogenes at once, increasing cancer cell death and reducing cancer cell growth. SNAs are composed of multiple strands of DNA and RNA densely arranged around a nanoparticle center. ""We demonstrate a more specific, more personalized approach to therapy,"" Stegh said. ""SNAs are a very promising platform to silence the particular genes that drive or contribute to cancer progression in individual patients."" There are 16,000 new cases of the deadly brain tumor reported in the U.S. every year. Patients have a very poor prognosis, with median survival of just 14 to 16 months. The molecule miR-182 is a microRNA, a type of short non-coding RNA that can bind to hundreds of genes to reduce their protein expression in cells. Looking at large-scale genomic datasets, Stegh and colleagues saw that patients with higher levels of miR-182 had a better chance of surviving glioblastoma mulitforme longer. In the study, they found that miR-182 suppressed Bcl2L12, a cancer gene that blocks cancer cell death in response to chemo- and radiation therapy. The microRNA also impeded two other oncogenes, c-Met and HIF2A. The next challenge was establishing a way to get miR-182 to those specific targets. The solution was in SNAs, a structure invented by Northwestern colleague and co-author Chad Mirkin, the George B. Rathmann Professor of Chemistry at the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and a professor of medicine at Feinberg. ""We designed a novel delivery method for miR-182 using SNAs,"" Stegh said. ""Small gold nanoparticles are conjugated with miR-182 sequences. They cross the blood-brain/blood-tumor barrier, and accumulate within brain tumor sites, where they target oncogenes, regulate cell growth and differentiation, reduce tumor burden and prolong survival in our mouse models."" SNAs have unique properties that allow them to reach cells safely without causing toxicity or activating the immune system. ""Our approach to gene silencing has not been demonstrated before in such a powerful way for the treatment of brain cancers,"" Stegh said. ""These particles, microRNA based SNAs, could also potentially be used for gene silencing in other cancers and diseases of genetic origin."" Additional studies will be needed to test miR-182 and the nanoparticle delivery before it becomes an option for patients with glioblastoma mulitforme. But first, Stegh and colleagues want to hone the particle design and to investigate treatments that combine miR-182 with established chemotherapy drugs in mouse models.

In a paper published in the journal Science, cognitive psychologists Aimee E. Stahl and Lisa Feigenson demonstrate for the first time that babies learn new things by leveraging the core information they are born with. When something surprises a baby, like an object not behaving the way a baby expects it to, the baby not only focuses on that object, but ultimately learns more about it than from a similar yet predictable object. ""For young learners, the world is an incredibly complex place filled with dynamic stimuli. How do learners know what to focus on and learn more about, and what to ignore? Our research suggests that infants use what they already know about the world to form predictions. When these predictions are shown to be wrong, infants use this as a special opportunity for learning,"" said Feigenson, a professor of psychological and brain sciences in the university's Krieger School of Arts and Sciences. ""When babies are surprised, they learn much better, as though they are taking the occasion to try to figure something out about their world."" The two researchers' study involved four experiments with preverbal 11-month-old babies, designed to determine whether babies learned more effectively about objects that defied their expectations. If they did, researchers wondered if babies would also seek out more information about surprising objects and if this exploration meant babies were trying to find explanations for the objects' strange behavior. First the researchers showed the babies both surprising and predictable situations regarding an object. For instance, one group of infants saw a ball roll down a ramp and appear to be stopped by a wall in its path. Another group saw the ball roll down the ramp and appear to pass -- as if by magic -- right through the wall. When the researchers gave the babies new information about the surprising ball, the babies learned significantly better. In fact, the infants showed no evidence of learning about the predictable ball. Furthermore, the researchers found that the babies chose to explore the ball that had defied their expectations, even more than toys that were brand new but had not done anything surprising. The researchers found that the babies didn't just learn more about surprising objects -- they wanted to understand them. For instance, when the babies saw the surprising event in which the ball appeared to pass through the wall, they tested the ball's solidity by banging it on the table. But when babies saw a different surprising event, in which the ball appeared to hover in midair, they tested the ball's gravity by dropping it onto the floor. These results suggest that babies were testing specific hypotheses about the objects' surprising behavior. ""The infants' behaviors are not merely reflexive responses to the novelty of surprising outcomes, but instead reflect deeper attempts to learn about aspects of the world that failed to accord with expectations,"" said Stahl, the paper's lead author and a doctoral student in psychological and brain sciences. ""Infants are not only equipped with core knowledge about fundamental aspects of the world, but from early in their lives, they harness this knowledge to empower new learning.""

The study is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  The role of the hippocampus in spatial cognition versus memory formation is a major debating point in our understanding of how the human brain processes its exterior environment,  said senior author Larry Squire, PhD, Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry, Neurosciences, and Psychology.  This study shows that the hippocampus is primarily associated with memory. It s an adjudication on two perspectives that span more than 60 years of research.  In one of these perspectives, developed in the 1950s, the hippocampus is viewed as being the critical structure enabling the formation of declarative, long-term memories, such as the ability to remember one s high-school prom. That view shifted in the 1970s when experiments conducted largely with rats showed that the hippocampus plays a major role in spatial skills, such as those needed to navigate through a maze. The experiments led some researchers to speculate that the human hippocampus might also be active in spatial cognition and mapmaking skills.  We have not found evidence that this is the case,  said Squire, who is also a research career scientist at the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System.  Patients with hippocampal lesions can perform spatial tasks as long as these tasks don t depend on long-term memory. We think they can do these spatial tasks because these tasks can be managed within short-term memory functions, supported by the frontal lobe of the neocortex. The discrepancy we see with rats may reflect the fact that rodents don t have a well-developed frontal cortex or the associated short-term memory processing skills. The spatial tasks that we can do with our neocortex using short-term memory must be performed by the hippocampus in rats.  The results are based on experiments with six adults with hippocampal lesions, one adult with damage to the medial temporal lobe, which includes the hippocampus, and 12 control subjects. For the experiments, participants were asked to study a simple scene, such as a pair of boots, and to draw the scene from memory. The drawings were scored for detail and accuracy on a 1-5 scale. Participants were also evaluated for a normal tendency, known as boundary extension, in which people tend to recall an image as having a larger background and smaller foreground than is present in reality. In the boot example, this means people tend to draw the boots smaller than they were in the original photograph. The background consequently takes up a larger fraction of the image, hence the term boundary extension. In a second set of experiments, participants were asked to look at a scene, such as a slide in a park, and describe what might come into view if the image were enlarged. The participants  narratives were scored for details, spatial references, thoughts and emotions. All participants with hippocampal damage demonstrated an impaired ability to accurately recall details about the boots. Their average score was 2, compared with 3 for the control group. However, the patients displayed normal boundary extension. Both patients and control subjects shrunk the size of the boots relative to the background by about 60 percent. Both groups were also equally skilled in imagining and constructing detailed narratives about what might come into view if the scenes were expanded.  The value of this type of research is that we are building an understanding of how the brain works,  Squire said.  We know Alzheimer s disease usually begins in the medial temporal lobe and this study reminds us that it s not the patients  spatial skills that are immediately at risk, it is their memory. This is consistent with clinical experiences. Patients don t complain about loss of spatial skills, they complain about memory loss.

Results show that 3.9 percent of participants reported having frequent nightmares during the previous 30 days, including 4.8 percent of women and 2.9 percent of men. Frequent nightmares were reported by 28.4 percent of participants with severe depressive symptoms and 17.1 percent of those with frequent insomnia. Further analysis that adjusted for potential confounders found that the strongest independent risk factors for nightmares were insomnia, exhaustion and the depressive symptom of  negative attitude toward self.   Our study shows a clear connection between well-being and nightmares,  said lead author Nils Sandman, a researcher in the Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Turku in Finland.  This is most evident in the connection between nightmares and depression, but also apparent in many other analyses involving nightmares and questions measuring life satisfaction and health.  Study results are published in the April issue of the journal Sleep. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine reports that nightmares are vivid, realistic and disturbing dreams typically involving threats to survival or security, which often evoke emotions of anxiety, fear or terror. A nightmare disorder may occur when repeated nightmares cause distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning. The study was a joint effort of the University of Turku and the Finnish National Institute of Health and Welfare. Sandman and the research team analyzed data from two independent cross-sectional surveys of the Finnish general adult population conducted in 2007 and 2012. Participants were 13,922 adults between 25 and 74 years of age. Fifty-three percent were women. The surveys involved a questionnaire that was mailed to the participants and a health examination at the local primary health care center, where the completed questionnaire was returned and checked by a nurse. Occasional nightmares in the past 30 days were reported by more than 45 percent of participants, and 50.6 percent reported no nightmares at all. Sandman noted that the cross-sectional study did not allow for an examination of causality. However, he suggested that the results do raise intriguing possibilities worth investigating in the future.  It might be possible that nightmares could function as early indicators of onset of depression and therefore have previously untapped diagnostic value,  he said.  Also, because nightmares, insomnia and depression often appear together, would it be possible to treat all of these problems with an intervention directed solely toward nightmares?

And now, an international team of scientists has found tiny triggers inside those cells that give rise to this ""voice,"" and keep it speaking throughout life. The new research, done in fish and mice, can't yet be applied to humans who eat too much or too little. But it reveals how tiny bits of DNA can have a big influence on how the body regulates appetite and weight. It's the first documentation of exactly how a brain cell gene involved in weight regulation is controlled. In a new paper published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), and a recent paper in PLoS Genetics, the team reports their discoveries on genetic factors key to the neurons called POMC cells. Located deep inside the brain, in the hypothalamus, the cluster of POMC neurons act as a control center for feelings of fullness or hunger. They take in signals from the body, and send out chemical signals to regulate appetite and eating. When POMC neurons are absent, or not working correctly, animals and humans grow dangerously obese. Now, the new findings show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the POMC cells aren't working. The team, led by Malcolm Low, M.D., Ph.D. of the University of Michigan Medical School and Marcelo Rubinstein, Ph.D., of the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina, has studied the POMC system for years. Their new findings center on the gene inside the cells that generates the appetite-regulating signals -- the Pomc ( proopiomelanocortin) gene. But studying the gene itself doesn't tell the whole story of why and how POMC cells do what they do. In the two new papers, the team reports how a protein called a transcription factor, and two small stretches of DNA called enhancers, act as triggers for the Pomc gene. All three regulate how often and when the POMC cells use the gene to create the signal molecules that then go out to the body. The transcription factor, called Islet 1, also plays a key role in helping POMC cells form correctly during the earliest stages of the brain's development, before birth. ""The POMC region is a central node of the brain's means for regulating body weight, in response to influences from the hormone leptin,"" says Low, a professor in the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology. ""We're interested in understanding how the Pomc gene is regulated in these neurons, which are a very small population with a big job."" Probing gene triggers The discovery reported in PLoS Genetics shows the impact of two different gene enhancers -- stretches of DNA near the Pomc gene that make it easier for the cell to read it. Like signal lights that show pilots the path to an airport runway, enhancers guide proteins toward the gene so it can be read. The researchers found that the two enhancers act in ways that complement one another, both encouraging the expression of the Pomc gene at key times. One of the two is found in the same form among all mammals, the other among all placental mammals -- suggesting that they've been kept intact throughout the evolutionary process. The new research shows the enhancers, called nPE1 and nPE2, specifically regulate the Pomc gene only in the brain. Mice born without both of them became obese -- as if their Pomc gene had been deactivated. Meanwhile, mice that just lacked nPE2 grew normally, as the presence of nPE1 compensated. The redundant enhancer system for Pomc suggests the gene's importance, Low says. But when it comes to understanding what triggers a cell to read a gene, gene enhancers are only part of the equation. The protein that latches on to the enhancer, called a transcription factor, is also vital. In the new PNAS paper, the researchers report that the transcription factor Islet 1, encoded by the Isl1 gene, plays this important role for Pomc. As its name suggests, Islet 1 plays a transcription factor role in the islet cells of the pancreas, which make insulin to help the body process sugar from food. But, it turns out, it also plays this role in POMC cells. When the researchers blocked cells of the hypothalamus from making Islet 1 halfway through pregnancy, the fetal mice failed to develop any POMC cells. Moreover, when they allowed mice to make Islet 1 normally in the hypothalamus before birth, then blocked it, the amount of POMC was markedly reduced and obesity resulted. The researchers were also able to show the importance of Islet 1 in zebrafish, which also fail to develop POMC neurons when the transcription factor was blocked early in development. Since zebrafish use different gene enhancers to regulate the reading of the Pomc gene, this shows the true importance of Islet 1 by itself. ""Taken together, this work represents the first example of a neuron-specific gene in vertebrates where we have found both the enhancers and a shared transcription factor that control gene expression in the developing brain and then throughout the life span of the adult,"" says Low. Future directions Studying the impact of a total loss of Islet 1 or one or both of the two Pomc gene enhancers in animals showed the importance of these triggers, he says. But looking to see if the same factors do the same thing in humans will be more complex -- and there may be other enhancers and transcription factors involved. So far, genome-wide studies of humans have not shown any relationship between obesity and changes in the Isl1 gene. Brain imaging that tracks the binding of signals to and from POMC cells could reveal further clues. And in theory, it could be possible to find drugs to increase the production of Pomc gene products, or to grow replacement cells for malfunctioning POMC cells. ""For humans, Pomc regulation may be part of the equation of weight control,"" says Low. ""We don't know, but we think it likely, that it may be similar to the mouse model, where its role is like a dial, with a linear relationship between the amount of Pomc expression and the degree of obesity. This research opens up our overall understanding of how the brain works to regulate feeding."" Low and Rubinstein just received a new National Institutes of Health grant to continue their POMC cell work. They hope to look for other transcription factors, and to examine the roles of leptin and estrogen in stimulating POMC cells. They also hope to use neurons grown from induced pluripotent stem cells to study genetic activity during POMC cell development. And they'll study POMC activity in mice that are pregnant or nursing, when POMC expression goes down and feeding increases.

For more than 50 years, it has been known that mice sing. That is, they emit what s called  ultrasonic vocalizations  or USVs, sounds so high-pitched that people can t hear them. These vocalizations are known to occur in the wild when a mouse pup calls for its mother. And USVs grow more complex as mice reach adulthood. But researchers are still trying to decode the songs and determine how they vary across different social situations. The new results add to evidence suggesting that although mice have a more limited ability to modify their songs than songbirds, they may be useful in research to understand some features of vocal communication and communication disorders, said co-corresponding author Erich Jarvis, an associate professor of neurobiology at Duke University and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. Duke postdoctoral fellow Jonathan Chabout exposed adult male mice to different social contexts, and, in collaboration with David Dunson and Abhra Sarkar in Duke s Department of Statistical Science, developed a new computational approach for analyzing mouse songs. Informed by their analyses of male songbirds' courtship songs, the team studied the dynamics between the various syllables in a given mouse song, defined as a series of utterances or syllables strung together, sometimes with a tempo. The team found that males sing more complex songs -- and louder -- when they smell a female s urine but don t see her. By comparison, the songs are longer and simpler when the males sing directly to the female in her presence. We think this has something to do with the complex song being like a calling song, and then when he sees the female, he switches to a simpler song in order to save energy to chase and try to court her at the same time,  said Jarvis, who is also a member of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences.  It was surprising to me how much change occurs to these songs in different social contexts, when the songs are thought to be innate,  Jarvis added.  It is clear that the mouse s ability to vocalize is a lot more limited than a songbird s or human s, and yet it's remarkable that we can find these differences in song complexity.  Within a given song, the mice produce specific patterns rather than random strings of syllables, Chabout said. But what did the female mice think of this? Most female mice prefer spending time by speakers playing the complex tunes. The fact that the females reacted differently to the different songs further strengthens the group s conclusion that these various calls carry meaning, Chabout said. The scientists plan to investigate the role of various genes and brain areas in the songs. The researchers aren't sure yet how much the mice can learn to modify their songs rather than choosing among fixed patterns. Jarvis said the answer will be important for the study of autism spectrum disorders, characterized in part by deficits in social communication and, presumably, in brain circuits that control learned behavior.  That s why we and other scientists from all over the globe are studying mice to test the limits of vocal learning and plasticity,  Jarvis said. The researchers uploaded their recordings to  MouseTube,  a growing repository built by scientists at the Institute Pasteur in Paris that is expected to contain USVs from around the world, across different strains and in different experimental contexts. (The particular mouse that scientists used in the new study they already knew to be more vocal than others.)  We hope to help other researchers study USVs,  Chabout said.  And we bring a new way of looking at them dynamically.  The new method, Mouse Song Analyzer v1.3, and an Excel-based song analysis tool, are freely available on the Jarvis lab website.

For this, quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) is a popular method that often involve the use of constitutively expressed endogenous reference (or 'housekeeping') gene for normalization of data. Thus, it is essential to use reference genes that have been verified to be stably expressed within the specific experimental setting. Here, we have analysed the expression stability of 12 commonly used reference genes (Actb, B2m, Gapdh, Hprt, Pgk1, Rn18s, Rpl13a, Rps18, Rps29, Sdha, Tbp and Ubc) across several juvenile and adult rat tissues (liver, adrenal, prostate, fat pad, testis and ovaries), both under normal conditions and following exposure to various chemicals during development. Employing NormFinder and BestKeeper softwares, we found Hprt and Sdha to be amongst the most stable genes across normal and manipulated tissues, with several others also being suitable for most tissues. Tbp and B2m displayed highest variability in transcript levels between tissues and developmental stages. It was also observed that the reference genes were most unstable in liver and testis following toxicological exposure. For future studies, we propose the use of more than one verified reference gene and the continuous monitoring of their suitability under various experimental conditions, including toxicological studies, based on changes in threshold (Ct) values from cDNA samples having been reverse-transcribed from a constant input concentration of RNA.

The researchers compared three methods to detect malaria parasites to look for Plasmodium falciparum in 498 samples randomly selected from a malaria survey in Tanzania: light microscopy, the current standard molecular assay, and the new assays. Parasites were detected in 25% of samples by light microscopy, in 50% by the standard assay, and in 58% by the new assays. Compared to the new assays, the current molecular standard assay failed to identify 16% of infections, and at least 40% of those contained parasite gametocytes, the parasite stage that is transmitted when mosquitoes bite an infected person. The new assays detect only the most common malaria parasite, P. falciparum, and while they can use very small blood samples collected  in the field , the analysis itself needs to be done in a biomedical laboratory. Nonetheless, because low-density infections without disease symptoms are expected to become increasingly common as countries improve malaria control, ultra-sensitive tools such as these will likely be critical for malaria surveillance and for monitoring the progress of malaria control and elimination programs.

The diagnosis was confirmed by newborn exam, prenatal or postnatal genetic analysis. The test focuses on the small percentage of fetal DNA found floating in a pregnant woman s blood. DNA is amplified with a molecular  photocopying  technique known as polymerase chain reaction, and sequenced so that comparisons can be made between relative amounts of each chromosome s DNA. A greater quantity of DNA is indicative of some chromosomal conditions, including Down syndrome, which is characterized by an extra copy of chromosome 21, one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes. When the same women underwent standard screening, 30 of the 38 fetuses with Down syndrome were flagged, according to the study published on April 1, 2015, in the New England Journal of Medicine. The screening comprises a blood draw in which hormones and proteins associated with chromosomal defects are identified, together with an ultrasound of the nuchal fold fluid in the back of the neck, an excess of which is suggestive of Down syndrome. The average age of the pregnant women was 30 and approximately one-quarter were over 35   the age at which women have traditionally been considered high risk and offered prenatal invasive testing with procedures like amniocentesis. A second compelling advantage of cell-free DNA analysis, reported by the researchers who were led by first author Mary Norton, MD, professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at UCSF, was the relatively low incidence of Down syndrome misdiagnoses. While standard testing is acknowledged to result in a large number of false positives, these were significantly less likely with the cell-free DNA tool. There were nine false positives resulting from this method, vs. 854 with standard screening. While far fewer cases of two other less common chromosomal abnormalities were found in the study population, the accuracy of cell-free DNA screening still surpassed the other standard screening method. Among 10 cases of trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome, the cell-free DNA technique pinpointed nine and flagged one false positive. With standard screening, eight were identified and there were 49 false positives. For trisomy 13, also known as Patau syndrome, the cell-free DNA test identified both cases and flagged one false positive, while standard screening identified one case and flagged 28 false positives. Although these findings suggest the superiority of cell-free DNA screening over standard protocol, the study highlighted areas of caution. Standard screening  can identify risk for a broad array of abnormalities that are not detectable on cell-free DNA testing,  the researchers wrote in their paper. Cases of Down syndrome comprise just over 50 percent of aneuploidies, the disorders that result from an abnormal number of chromosomes, they noted. Additionally, a surprisingly high number of aneuploidies were present in the 488 pregnant women whose plasma samples were disqualified due to an inadequate or immeasurable quantity of fetal DNA, or assay failure or high sequencing variance that can lead to difficulties interpreting results. Some 2.7 percent of these fetuses had chromosomal defects, which included those that would not have been identified with the cell-free DNA technique. This was markedly higher than the 0.4 prevalence in the overall group. Had this disqualified cohort been included in the findings, the detection rates of the cell-free DNA tool would have been lower. Dr. Norton said that use of the cell-free DNA test will result in far fewer false positives than current screening, and can consequently reduce the number of invasive tests and miscarriages attributed to them. However, patients should be made aware of its limitations, she added.  Providers need to be attuned to patients  preferences and counsel them about the differences in prenatal screening and diagnostic testing options. Those women who do opt for cell-free DNA testing should be informed that it is highly accurate for Down syndrome, but it focuses on a small number of chromosomal abnormalities and does not provide the comprehensive assessment available with other approaches.  Counseling should also include information about the risks associated with failed tests and the pros and cons of pursuing invasive testing if no results are obtained,  she said. The study was supported by funds from Ariosa Diagnostics in collaboration with the Perinatal Quality Foundation.","Published: April 2, 2015"

This collaboration advances Merck Serono s comprehensive, science-driven strategy to develop innovative therapies that modulate the immune system's natural ability to fight tumors.  The collaboration with Intrexon underlies Merck Serono s focus on innovation, and enhances its R&D technology portfolio in immuno-oncology,  says Belen Garijo, President and CEO of Merck Serono.  Moreover, it showcases Merck Serono s commitment to developing therapies that have the potential to significantly evolve the way cancer is treated.  CAR-T cells are genetically engineered T-cells with synthetic receptors that recognize a specific antigen expressed on tumor cells. When CAR-T cells bind to a target, an immunological attack against the cancer cells is triggered. Utilizing Intrexon s cell engineering techniques and RheoSwitch  platform, the collaboration aims to develop leading-edge products that empower the immune system in a regulated manner to overcome the current challenges of CAR-T therapy. The agreement provides Merck Serono exclusive access to Intrexon s proprietary and complementary suite of technologies to engineer T-cells with optimized and inducible gene expression, as recently strengthened by a license agreement with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Intrexon will be responsible for all platform and product developments until IND filing. Merck will nominate targets of interest for which CAR-T products will be developed.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/experimental-ebola-vaccine-safe-prompts-immune-response-194140,Experimental Ebola Vaccine Safe  Prompts Immune Response Results from US government sponsored phase   trial of VSV vaccine reported  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. An early-stage clinical trial of an experimental Ebola vaccine conducted at the National Institutes of Health and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) found that the vaccine, called VSV-ZEBOV, was safe and elicited robust antibody responses in all 40 of the healthy adults who received it. The most common side effects were injection site pain and transient fever that appeared and resolved within 12 to 36 hours after vaccination. A report describing preliminary results of the NIH-WRAIR study appears online in The New England Journal of Medicine. The VSV-ZEBOV candidate is one of two experimental Ebola vaccines now being tested in the phase 2/3 PREVAIL clinical trial that is enrolling volunteers in Liberia.  The ongoing Ebola ongoing outbreak in West Africa is unprecedented in scope and duration,  said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of NIH.  The outbreak is slowly coming under control, thanks to extraordinary and multi-faceted efforts in the affected nations. However, there still are no licensed specific therapies or vaccines for Ebola. Until a safe and effective vaccine is available, the world will continue to be under-prepared for the next Ebola outbreak.  Scientists at the Public Health Agency of Canada developed the candidate vaccine. It was licensed to NewLink Genetics Corp. of Ames, Iowa, a company collaborating with Merck & Co. Inc., of Kenilworth, New Jersey, which is responsible for advancing this vaccine towards regulatory approval. The investigational vaccine is based on a genetically modified and attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a virus that mainly affects cattle. In the investigational vaccine, a gene for a VSV protein is replaced with a gene segment from a key protein in the Zaire species of Ebola virus. The vaccine does not contain the whole Ebola virus and therefore cannot infect vaccinated persons with Ebola. The new report summarizes results of the first 52 volunteers enrolled in the study: 26 at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and 26 at the WRAIR clinic in Silver Spring, Maryland. Six volunteers at each site received a placebo injection of saline solution, and the remaining 40 received the experimental vaccine at either one of two different dosages (2 x107 or 3 x106 in 20 volunteers at each site.) The NIH trial was led by NIAID investigators Richard T. Davey, Jr., M.D., and John H. Beigel, M.D., while Jason A. Regules, M.D., and Stephen J. Thomas, M.D., headed the trial at WRAIR. The candidate vaccine s ability to stimulate immune responses was assessed by sampling the volunteers  blood at multiple time points following injection. (The blood sampling schedule differed between the two trial sites.) Of those volunteers tested at 14 days after injection, 93 percent (26 out of 28) of whose who had received vaccine developed antibodies against Zaire species of Ebola virus. Antibodies were detected in the remaining 14 volunteers who had received vaccine by 28 days after injection. Antibody responses were approximately three-fold greater in those who received the higher vaccine dose. This information was available to the designers of the PREVAIL trial and was used to guide the decision to use VSV-ZEBOV at the higher dosage level in that trial.  The prompt, dose-dependent production of high levels of antibodies following a single injection and the overall favorable safety profile of this vaccine make VSV-ZEBOV a promising candidate that might be particularly useful in outbreak interventions,  said Dr. Davey. The volunteers tolerated the vaccine well. Thirty percent (12 out of 40) of those who received the vaccine experienced mild or moderate fever; in all but one case, fever appeared and resolved within 24 hours of vaccination. The VSV-ZEBOV vaccine is made from live, weakened VSV and self-limiting fever following immunization with a live virus vaccine is not unexpected. Some volunteers in a separate, Swiss study of this candidate vaccine reported experiencing arthritis that started in the second week after vaccination. Therefore, volunteers in the NIH-WRAIR study were specifically queried about new arthritis symptoms. No episodes of frank arthritis were reported by any volunteer.","Published: April 2, 2015"

Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria alters itself to reduce the effectiveness of drugs designed to eliminate bacteria. The most common cause of resistance is overuse of antibiotics. As bacteria are increasingly exposed to antibiotic treatments, they evolve in ways that make them less vulnerable to the treatments. This resistance gives rise to superbugs that do not respond to current antibiotic therapies. Fast is studying a class of enzymes called metallo-beta-lactamases that confer resistance to almost all clinically used beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and even carbapenems that are often used as drugs of last resort for treating resistant infections. One of the more prominent examples is a superbug called NDM, named after its primary resistance determinant New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase, which has quickly spread worldwide since its 2008 discovery in India.  Inhibitors of these enzymes could resurrect our ability to use a whole class of antibiotics on resistant infections,  Fast said,  but there are currently no approved drugs that counter metallo-beta-lactamase activity.  Fast had studied metallo-beta-lactamases as a postdoctoral fellow, but when he joined the UT Austin faculty in 2002, he moved his focus to structurally related proteins that interfere with interbacterial communication pathways.  After hearing about NDM on the news,  said Fast,  I felt like we could build on what we ve learned from related proteins and really make a meaningful contribution.  He recruited an interdisciplinary research team with labs headed by Dr. Seth Cohen at the University of California, San Diego; Dr. Robert Bonomo at Case Western Reserve University; and Drs. Michael Crowder, David Tierney and Rick Page at the University of Miami, Ohio. The teams use fragment-based library design, high-throughput screening, enzymology, biophysical characterization, X-ray crystallography and microbiology to develop drug-like inhibitors that target the most clinically prevalent metallo-beta-lactamases. The Center for Infectious Disease and the small-molecule screening core of the Texas Screening Alliance at The University of Texas at Austin will also provide resources for the project. Ultimately, the team s goal is to develop a suite of structurally diverse inhibitors suitable for pre-clinical trials.","Published: April 2, 2015"

High-speed spectroscopic imaging makes it possible to observe the quickly-changing metabolic processes inside living cells and to image large areas of tissue, making it possible to scan an entire organ. ""For example, we will be able to image the esophagus or urinary bladder for diagnosis of tumors,"" said Ji-Xin Cheng, a professor in Purdue University's Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Chemistry. ""If you were to take one millisecond per pixel, then it would take 10 minutes to obtain an image, and that's too slow to see what's happening in cells. Now we can take a complete scan in two seconds."" The technology represents a new way to use stimulated Raman scattering to perform microsecond-speed vibrational spectroscopic imaging, which can identify and track certain molecules by measuring their vibrational spectrum with a laser, a sort of spectral fingerprint. Findings appeared on March 27 in the Nature Publishing Group journal Light: Science & Application. The imaging technique is ""label free,"" meaning it does not require samples to be marked with dyes, making it appealing for diagnostic applications. Another advantage of the new system is that it can be combined with another technique called flow cytometry to look at a million cells per second. ""You can look at large numbers of cells from a patient's blood sample to detect tumors, for example, and you can also look directly at organs with an endoscope,"" said Cheng, scientific director of the Label-free Imaging lab in the Birck Nanotechnology Center in Purdue's Discovery Park. ""These capabilities will change how people use Raman spectroscopy for medicine. There are many organelles in each cell, and spectroscopy can tell us what's in the organelles, which is information not available by other techniques."" The paper was authored by Cheng; graduate students Chien-Sheng Liao, Junjie Li and Seung-Young Lee; research scientist Mikhail Slipchenko; Ping Wang, a post-doctoral research associate; and Robert Oglesbee, a former engineer at Purdue's Jonathan Amy Facility for Chemical Instrumentation in the Department of Chemistry. As a proof of concept, the researchers demonstrated the new system by observing how human cancer cells metabolize vitamin A and how medications are distributed in the skin. The technology, which is about 1,000 times faster than a commercial Raman microscope, is made possible with an electronic device developed at the Jonathan Amy Facility called a 32-channel tuned amplifier array, or TAMP array. Two patents have been issued for the new technology. Cheng said the idea for this imaging technology was inspired by teaching undergraduates how the human ear amplifies sound. Circuits in the TAMP device do the same thing for optical signals, he said.","Published: April 2, 2015"

Manicke has received a $273,826 award from the U.S. Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice to improve the speed and accuracy of mass spectrometry for detecting drugs and poisons in blood samples. On ""CSI,"" ""NCIS"" and other popular television shows, mass spectrometers rapidly analyze biological samples and spit out definitive results of complex analyses. But in real life, mass spectrometry findings are less straightforward and slower paced. ""Current technology does not meet the demand for rapid, effective and simple drug screening methodologies for forensic toxicology applications,"" said Manicke, assistant professor of chemistry and chemical biology and a faculty member of the School of Science's Forensic and Investigative Sciences Program at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. With the NIJ award, Manicke will proceed with his work to simultaneously advance the quality and throughput rate of mass spectrometry analysis of biosamples, specifically blood samples, to determine cause of death. The participation of an IUPUI graduate student in the project is supported by the grant, and several undergraduates will also be involved. ""Hundreds of common drugs could cause death. Current broad screening and detection methods catch wide swaths but are not ideal,"" said Manicke. ""Unfortunately, the large number of false positives that arise from current screening methods increase the burden for laboratories to do confirmatory tests. Also, their poor sensitivity can mean that drugs at low concentrations may not be detected at all during the initial screen.  ""AIT Laboratories, an Indianapolis-based company specializing in toxicological analyses, will help in the testing of this new approach to drug screening,"" Manicke said. ""AIT Labs will provide real forensic specimens for testing, and the results we obtain will be validated against their standard confirmatory tests."" Before joining the IUPUI faculty in 2013, Manicke and colleagues at Purdue University, where he completed graduate studies and served as a postdoctoral research associate, developed paper spray. A mass spectrometry ionization method, paper spray allows for quantitative and qualitative analysis from complex samples without prior sample purification. In a study published in June 2014 in the American Chemical Society's peer-reviewed journal Analytical Chemistry, Manicke and colleagues reported on the successful use of paper spray to detect very low concentrations of eight common drugs of abuse in blood samples. This work demonstrated the value of paper spray for rapid investigation of biological samples, allowing for the direct analysis of complex samples without the laborious sample preparation process normally associated with mass spectrometry. Manicke said that because of its sensitivity and specificity, the paper spray mass spectrometry method has potential use in such diverse fields as biomedical research and clinical testing, homeland security, drug screening and food safety, in addition to forensic science. ""The development of paper spray mass spectrometry, which requires no sample preparation, has been driven primarily by the need for faster and simpler procedures for the analysis of drugs and pharmaceuticals directly from whole blood,"" he said. ""With this support from the National Institute of Justice we hope to develop paper spray mass spectrometry into an effective drug screening tool for applications in forensic toxicology, particularly analysis of postmortem blood samples."" The School of Science at IUPUI is committed to excellence in teaching, research and service in the biological, physical, behavioral and mathematical sciences. The school is dedicated to being a leading resource for interdisciplinary research and science education in support of Indiana's effort to expand and diversify its economy.","Published: April 2, 2015"

The goal of this new part of the alliance is to leverage insights from human genetics to help create new cardiovascular therapies.  It is exciting to be expanding on our ongoing, successful partnership with Bayer in oncology,  said Professor Eric Lander, President and Director of Broad Institute.  We are looking forward to a fruitful collaboration combining Bayer s expertise in the cardiovascular therapeutic area with Broad s deep knowledge of genomics and biology . Cardiovascular genomics is an emerging field of cardiology that uses genomic information to characterize disease risk and identify new therapeutic targets for drug discovery. Cardiovascular disease is responsible for approximately one-third of all deaths worldwide each year. While a majority of cardiovascular disease can be associated with lifestyle factors such as tobacco consumption, diet, and level of physical activity, risk genes can influence the predisposition to cardiovascular disease, age of onset, and severity.  We are excited to broaden our collaboration with the Broad Institute to the area of cardiovascular genomics to discover genes and mutational changes underlying cardiovascular disorders in order to develop new therapies and diagnostic options for these diseases,  said Prof. Andreas Busch, Head of Global Drug Discovery and member of the Executive Committee of Bayer HealthCare.  We have been collaborating already for the last two years and have developed a very constructive partnership during this time.  As part of this strategic alliance, Broad Institute and Bayer HealthCare will collaborate on genetic discovery, target validation, and drug discovery activities.

But it turns out the immune system has traitors amongst their ranks. Dr. Karin de Visser and her team at the Netherlands Cancer Institute discovered that certain immune cells are persuaded by breast tumors to facilitate the spread of cancer cells. In Western countries about one in eight women will develop breast cancer. Of the women who die of this disease, 90 percent dies because the cancer has spread to other parts of their body and formed metastases. For this reason, cancer researchers are trying to understand how the process of metastasis occurs. A few years ago, it was reported that breast cancer patients with a high number of immune cells called neutrophils in their blood are at increased risk of developing metastases. Immune cells are supposed to protect our body. So why are high neutrophil levels linked to worse outcome in women with breast cancer? Domino effectDr. Karin de Visser, group leader at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, and her team discovered that certain types of breast tumors cause a domino effect of reactions within the immune system. The tumor sends out signaling molecules that through a number of steps cause the immune system to produce lots of neutrophils. This normally happens as part of an inflammatory reaction, but the neutrophils that are activated by the tumor behave differently. It turns out they are able to block the actions of other immune cells, called T cells. T cells are the cells that can (sometimes) recognize and kill cancer cells. IL17De Visser and her team went on to discover that a signaling protein called interleukin 17 (or IL17) is important for this process. ""We saw in our experiments that IL17 is crucial for the increased production of neutrophils"", says De Visser. ""And not only that, it turns out that this is also the molecule that changes the behavior of the neutrophils, causing them to become T cell inhibitory."" The first author of the study, postdoctoral researcher Seth Coffelt, showed the importance of the IL17-neutrophil pathway by inhibiting this pathway in a mouse model that mimics human breast cancer metastasis. When neutrophils were inhibited, the animals developed much less metastases than animals from the control group, in which the IL17-neutrophil route was not inhibited. ""What's notable is that blocking the IL17-neutrophil route prevented the development of metastases, but did not affect the primary tumor,"" De Visser comments. ""So this could be a promising strategy to prevent the tumor from spreading."" Anti-IL17 drugsSince neutrophils are important to protect us from infections, drugs that inhibit neutrophils would make patients susceptible to all kinds of infections. Inhibition of IL17 might be a safer strategy. In fact, drugs that do so already exist. Anti-IL17 drugs are currently being tested in clinical trials as a treatment for inflammatory diseases, like psoriasis and rheumatism. Last month, the first anti-IL17 based therapy for psoriasis patients was approved by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA). ""It would be very interesting to investigate whether these already existing drugs are beneficial for breast cancer patients. It may be possible to turn these traitors of the immune system back towards the good side and prevent their ability to promote breast cancer metastasis,"" De Visser says.","Published: April 2, 2015"

Their results are published in Current Biology. We've all had that 'Aha!' moment when pieces of a puzzling problem seem to fall into place as we gain insight into a previously obscured solution. But what happens in our brains when we think 'Aha!'? That was the question that Branka Milivojevic, Alejandro Vicente-Grabovetsky and Christian D ller, researchers from the Donders Institute at Radboud University, sought to answer. Branka and her colleagues used The Sims 3 life-simulation game to make animated videos of life-like events which they showed to participants whose brain activity was monitored using an MRI scanner. They found that after people realized how some events fit together into a story, the memories of those events were joined together -- just like pieces of a puzzle -- to form a new memory of the entire story. This effect could be seen in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex: brain regions involved in memory for personal, autobiographical, events. This is the first time scientists have been able to visualize how the brain flexibly recombines memories of past events when new information comes to light. This research has important implications for knowledge acquisition in educational settings. It suggest that teachers can aid learning, not only by explicitly providing the context for new material as they already do, but also by pointing out links within previously learned material, thus eliciting reorganization of neural representations of knowledge and the accompanying formation of an integrated ""big picture.""

In mice, it is possible to simulate the symptoms of this disease using a substance that selectively kills dopamine-producing neurons. Scientists from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) have now shown for the first time in mouse experiments that after this treatment, cells of the peripheral immune system migrate from the bloodstream into the brain, where they play a major role in the death of neurons. The investigators were able to reduce the level of neurodegeneration using a substance that blocks a specific surface molecule on these inflammatory cells. The small midbrain area, the substantia nigra, is the control center for all bodily movement. Increasing loss of dopamine-generating neurons in this part of the brain therefore leads to the main symptoms of Parkinson's disease -- slowness of movement, rigidity and shaking. In recent years, there has been increasing scientific evidence suggesting that inflammatory changes in the brain play a major role in Parkinson's. So far, it has been largely unclear whether this inflammation arises inside the brain itself or whether cells of the innate immune system that enter the brain from the bloodstream are also involved. At the DKFZ, a team led by Prof. Dr. Ana Martin-Villalba is investigating causes of cell death in the central nervous system. Neuroscientist Martin-Villalba has suspected that a specific pair of molecules, the CD95 system, is involved in neuronal death in Parkinson's. This pair consists of the CD95 ligand and its corresponding receptor, CD95, also known as the ""death receptor."" Martin-Villalba recently showed that after spinal cord injury, inflammatory cells use these molecules to migrate to the injury site, where they cause damage to the tissue. Martin-Villalba then wanted to investigate whether peripheral inflammatory cells also play a role in chronic neurodegenerative processes such as Parkinson's disease. To investigate the process of neurodegeneration in mice, the scientists utilized a model system using the substance MPTP, which causes the selective death of dopamine-generating neurons in the human brain. In mice, MPTP typically causes Parkinson-like symptoms. However, in mice whose inflammatory cells (monocytes, microglia) were unable to produce CD95L, MPTP treatment resulted in almost no neurodegeneration. This suggested that CD95L-bearing inflammatory cells are involved in the destruction of neurons. However, it remained unclear whether the true culprits are specific macrophages in the brain called microglia, or rather monocytes in the bloodstream that infiltrate the brain. In order to make this distinction, the investigators used a chemical that blocks CD95L without being able to pass the blood-brain barrier. This substance therefore reaches only the inflammatory cells that circulate in the bloodstream and not the microglia that reside in the brain. Mice that had received this substance were also protected from MPTP-induced neurodegeneration. ""Thus, we have shown for the first time that peripheral inflammatory cells of the innate immune system also play a role in neurodegeneration,"" say Liang Gao and David Brenner, first authors of the publication. ""A key role in this process is played by CD95L, which enhances the mobility of these cells."" Project leader Martin-Villalba speculates that a self-reinforcing vicious cycle arises in the brain: The breakdown of a few neurons that die from various causes attracts inflammatory cells that, in turn, further fuel the death of more neurons through inflammation-promoting signaling molecules. At present, the researchers can only indirectly conclude that the results obtained in the artificial animal model are also relevant in human Parkinson's disease. In collaboration with colleagues from Ulm, Martin-Villalba's team recently found elevated quantities of inflammatory monocytes that were hyperactive in blood samples from Parkinson's patients. Monocyte number correlated with the severity of disease symptoms. However, the researchers do not yet know whether these inflammatory cells also migrate into the brains of patients and contribute to the demise of neurons there, like they do in the mice with Parkinson's. ""If this is the case, drugs that inhibit CD95L might mitigate Parkinson's symptoms if administered early on -- similar to what we observed in our experimental mice,"" says Martin-Villalba. The substance required for this has already been investigated in clinical Phase II trials. Martin-Villalba also suspects that activated cells of the peripheral immune system might drive neurodegeneration not only in Parkinson's disease but also in other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's.

Dr. Mark Fisher, a professor of neurology and pathology & laboratory medicine, and colleagues evaluated 75 stroke patients at UC Irvine Medical Center to learn whether this left atrial septal pouch could be a potent source of stroke-causing blood clots. Of the 23 patients who had experienced a stroke of undetermined origin (a ""cryptogenic"" stroke), 30 percent possessed the left atrial septal pouch. It was present in only 10 percent of the 52 patients who'd had a stroke with an identifiable trigger. Stroke is the leading cause of long-term severe disability and the fourth-most-common cause of death in the U.S. About 80 percent of the 700,000-plus strokes that occur annually in this country are due to blood clots blocking a brain artery. In up to a third of these cases, the clots' origin cannot be determined. UC Irvine cardiologists first discovered this pouchlike structure inside the heart's left atrial chamber in a 2010 study. ""The cul-de-sac nature of this heart pouch may promote stagnation of the blood, forming clots that can travel into the brain and cause a stroke,"" Fisher said. ""This finding points to a potentially important cause of strokes,"" he added.

These findings were reported by researchers from the University of Basel and the Ruhr-University Bochum. Their results, based on data from 14,300 people living in Switzerland, have been published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health. Depression is one of the leading health risks and affects 350 million people worldwide. In Switzerland, around 400,000 people individuals suffer from it each year. Several studies in countries around the globe have shown that depression is associated with an elevated risk for a variety of physical diseases. However, for Switzerland, a country ranked as one of the wealthiest and with one of the best and most expensive health care systems worldwide, the association between depressive symptoms and physical diseases had yet been unclear. A research group led by Prof. Gunther Meinlschmidt from the Faculty of Psychology at the University of Basel and the Faculty of Medicine at the Ruhr-University Bochum has now attempted to close this gap. They conducted analyses, using data from the Swiss Health Survey, comprising of 14,348 subjects aged 15 years and older. The psychologists report that participants with depressive symptoms have a higher risk of suffering from a physical disease. Roughly one third of the participants suffering from depression also suffer from at least one physical disease. This association was evident especially with arthrosis and arthritis that are degenerative and inflammatory diseases of the joints. More studies are now needed to further scrutinize the association between depression and joint diseases. According to the study, it can be speculated that depressive symptoms result in a lack of interest in physical activity, which may then lead to joint diseases. However, it could also be the other way around: People with joint diseases may be impaired in their daily activities negatively affecting their mental health and ultimately resulting in depressive symptoms. Or: Joint diseases are often caused by inflammatory processes, which have also been speculated for certain types of depressive disorders. Therefore, inflammatory processes may represent the link between depressive symptoms and physical diseases. ""A better understanding of the association between depressive symptoms and physical diseases in Switzerland is the basis for a better health care provision for people suffering from mental disorders as well as physical diseases,"" says Gunther Meinlschmidt, author of the study. In addition, these findings are also important for health care policy, for example by improving the precision of future estimates of societal burden and costs related to depression.

This is about to change thanks to research by University of Toronto Professors Ben Blencowe and Sabine Cordes, who have developed a powerful model that will allow researchers to better understand the physiology behind many disorders. Blencowe and Cordes joined forces to create a mouse model that lacks the nSR100 gene (also known as SRRM4), which is important for brain development. They found that brains of mutant mice had many defects, including faulty neuron formation and brain wiring. Blencowe is a Professor in the University of Toronto's Donnelly Centre and Cordes is an Associate Professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics and Senior Investigator at the Mount Sinai Hospital's Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute. The results are published in the journal Genes & Development. nSR100 regulates the process by which proteins, the cell's workhorses, are built in the brain. Proteins are made based on a blueprint in the DNA sequence of genes. But it is not quite so simple. Genes are divided into protein coding parts, called exons, separated by non-coding spacers, called introns. To make a protein, the cell uses only exons, which are cut and pasted together in a process known as ""splicing."" What's more, these exons can be shuffled like LEGO blocks to make slightly different proteins from a single gene and nSR100 is a key regulator of this process in the brain. nSR100 is able to control the splicing and shuffling of tiny gene snippets, called microexons. Microexons code for very small bits of proteins, adding specks of material to protein surfaces that help them stick together. This is how proteins work; they come together as teams to, for example, help organize neurons into different parts of the brain and into neural networks. Microexons may be small, but they are mighty. Recent work from the Blencowe lab showed that brains of people with autism had lower levels of nSR100 that correlated with defective splicing of microexons. This meant that their proteins couldn't be made properly, but how this could lead to changes in the brain wasn't clear. To answer this question, Mathieu Quesnel-Vallieres, a graduate student jointly supervised by Blencowe and Cordes and the lead author of the study, removed the nSR100 gene altogether from mice to see what happens to their brains during development. The researchers found that most of the mice lacking the nSR100 gene died early, while those that survived had tremors. Upon close examination, their brains showed many errors in neuron formation and wiring. For example, cortical neurons that lacked the nSR100 gene made shorter processes. Neuronal processes are key to neuronal function; they're like cables that connect neurons together to facilitate communication. In addition, the cortical neurons looked similar to those found in people with autism and schizophrenia. ""The study is confirming in a whole animal model that nSR100 is very important for multiple neurodevelopmental processes. Our mutant mouse has potential for modeling neurological disorders in humans,"" says Blencowe. Looking into the future, Cordes believes that measuring nSR100 levels, whose deficit has been linked to autism, may be used to diagnose the disorder in newborns. These children could then undergo early intervention therapy that could significantly improve their social and behavioral outcomes. Blencowe and Cordes are also trying to figure out what makes nSR100 levels drop in people with autism. If they could bring it back to normal, this could potentially lead to a future treatment.

The drug, AZD05030, developed by Astra Zeneca proved disappointing in treating solid tumors but appears to block damage triggered during the formation of amyloid-beta plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer s disease. The new study, funded by an innovative National Institutes of Health (NIH) program to test failed drugs on different diseases, has led to the launch of human trials to test the efficacy of AZD05030 in Alzheimer s patients.  With this treatment, cells under bombardment by beta amyloid plaques show restored synaptic connections and reduced inflammation, and the animal s memory, which was lost during the course of the disease, comes back,  said Stephen M. Strittmatter, the Vincent Coates Professor of Neurology and senior author of the study. In the last five years, scientists have developed a more complete understanding of the complex chain of events that leads to Alzheimer s disease. The new drug blocks one of those molecular steps, activation of the enzyme FYN, which leads to the loss of synaptic connections between brain cells. Several other steps in the disease process have the potential to be targets for new drugs, Strittmatter said.

The two companies will work closely together as they establish Centrum Badan as Premaitha s preferred partner laboratory within Poland. The IONA  test is the first CE-marked in vitro diagnostic (IVD) product for NIPT, enabling genetic laboratories such as Centrum Badan to offer NIPT in-house. It uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to estimate the risk of a fetus having serious genetic disorders such as Down s syndrome (Trisomy 21), Edwards  syndrome (Trisomy 18) and Patau s syndrome (Trisomy 13) by analyzing cell-free fetal DNA from a sample of maternal blood. The IONA test  has a higher detection rate and lower false positive rate than the current combined test available to pregnant women in Poland. Last year there were 376,000 live births in Poland according to the Polish Statistical Office, and the uptake of NIPT tests is on the increase. The IONA  test will be available for pregnant women who wish to have a private non-invasive screening test and Centrum Badan will work with national hospitals wishing to offer high-risk pregnant women the test. Jacek Wojciechowicz, CEO of Centrum Badan, commented:  In our opinion, the IONA  test is superior over other tests due to the complete workflow package from DNA extraction through to analysis software and reporting. Premaitha s test also offers the highest accuracy and reliability with results available to clinicians in just three days. Having exclusive access to the only regulated CE-IVD NIPT in Europe for the pregnant women of Poland is a significant commercial advantage to our company. We anticipate launching the IONA  test in Poland over the next few weeks and look forward to working with the Premaitha team.  Dr Stephen Little, CEO of Premaitha said:  We have selected Centrum Badan as our preferred collaborator in Poland due to the company s technical next-generation sequencing expertise and its close network of obstetricians and clinicians. This collaboration is another fantastic endorsement of our IONA  test following so soon after our recent contract wins in Switzerland with Genoma and in the UK with St George s NHS Foundation Trust. We are very pleased with the progress we are making across Europe to bring NIPT to pregnant women. ","Published: April 1, 2015"

Analysis showed that its Quantose IR  test tracked changes in insulin sensitivity better than the hemoglobin A1C test in patients treated with the insulin sensitizer, pioglitazone. In the ACT NOW study, patients with impaired glucose tolerance were randomized to pioglitazone (45mg/day) or placebo and followed for an average of 2.4 years. Researchers conducted a retrospective study using samples from 210 subjects treated with pioglitazone to assess the clinical validity of Quantose IR for monitoring changes in insulin sensitivity. Quantose IR tracked insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, with a significant 29 percent improvement in Quantose IR scores in pioglitazone-treated patients. In contrast, A1C scores worsened slightly in the same subjects. Insulin resistance is a root cause of prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and other health conditions.  Identifying and managing insulin resistance play significant roles in guiding interventions to delay or prevent these conditions,  said study investigator Ralph A. DeFronzo, MD, Texas Diabetes Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center.  Until now, though, there were no simple tests to easily identify insulin resistance. Quantose IR appears to be a useful tool to identify and monitor therapy in insulin-resistant patients because of its strong correlation with improved insulin sensitivity and ease of use.   The Quantose IR test will help clinicians implement the recently issued American Diabetes Association intervention guidelines for prediabetes,  said Eric Button, senior vice president of diagnostics for Metabolon. Button continued,  While A1C is an excellent test for measuring changes in glucose, insulin resistance may occur more than 10 years before changes in glucose levels can be seen in a patient. Earlier clinical intervention along the continuum may prevent the progression to type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems. ","Published: April 1, 2015"

Now, nearly 15 years after it was declared safe, University of Florida Health researchers have found that the artificial sweetener can inhibit cancer cell growth. Saccharin shows considerable promise for its ability to inhibit an enzyme upregulated in many cancers, helping tumor cells survive and metastasize, said Robert McKenna, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology in the UF College of Medicine. After testing its effectiveness on cancer cells, researchers believe saccharin could eventually lead to the development of drugs that treat highly aggressive cancers affecting the breast, liver, prostate, kidney and pancreas. The findings were published recently in the journal Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry and are being presented Wednesday at the American Chemical Society convention in Denver. The discovery might never have happened if not for Brian Mahon, a curious UF graduate research assistant. He wanted to know how saccharin might affect the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase IX, which is found in aggressive cancers. But Mahon didn t want to wait a week for an order of pure saccharin to arrive at the lab. He bounced an idea off Jenna Driscoll, an undergraduate student majoring in microbiology and nutritional science, and Mam Mboge, a graduate student who had just joined the lab.  So we just went to a coffee shop and got some Sweet  N Low. I said,  Let s just try it  and we did and collected some data,  Mahon recalled. After doing some initial experimenting, the researchers are collaborating with Susan Frost, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology, to look at saccharin s effect on breast cancer cells.  Mam literally took Sweet  N Low and saccharin and showed that the rate of growth of the cancer cell slows down when you added it,  said McKenna, the paper s lead author and Mahon s mentor. The saccharin disrupts carbonic anhydrase IX s ability to regulate the cancer cell s pH level - its hydrogen ion concentration. That ultimately makes it harder for the cancer cell to grow and metastasize, researchers found. Targeting carbonic anhydrase IX is also an attractive option because it s not expressed in most other cells throughout the body, meaning that healthy tissue should remain unaffected even as cancer cells are weakened, McKenna said. Any saccharin-based drugs would probably be used in conjunction with traditional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation, according to the researchers. A saccharin drug would slow the cancer s growth, providing the opportunity for radiation or chemotherapy to be more effective at killing off the cancer cell.  It could help make conventional chemotherapy more effective,  McKenna said. The irony of a chemical that was once labeled a potential carcinogen now having potential as an anti-cancer agent wasn t lost on the research team. Studies in the 1970s linked saccharin to bladder cancer in laboratory rats, according to the National Cancer Institute. Congress ordered further study and passed a law in 1977 that mandated a warning label. Later studies found that the cancer incidence in rats was irrelevant to humans, leading to a repeal of the labeling requirement in late 2000. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration declared saccharin safe for consumption the following year.  The public only remembers the negative attention. Saccharin was seen as the bad guy and it s definitely not the bad guy. It may actually be a good guy,  McKenna said. The researchers want to further test saccharin s effectiveness in cancer cells and eventually move to mouse models. This summer, they plan to submit grant requests that will allow additional study and build on the data that have been acquired, McKenna said.","Published: April 1, 2015"

As the demand for instant, constant communication grows, so too does the urgency for more convenient portable devices - especially devices, like computer displays, that can be easily rolled up and put away, rather than requiring a flat surface for storage and transportation. A new Tel Aviv University study, published recently in Nature Nanotechnology, suggests that a novel DNA-peptide structure can be used to produce thin, transparent, and flexible screens. The research, conducted by Prof. Ehud Gazit and doctoral student Or Berger of the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology at TAU's George S. Wise Faculty of Life Sciences, in collaboration with Dr. Yuval Ebenstein and Prof. Fernando Patolsky of the School of Chemistry at TAU's Faculty of Exact Sciences, harnesses bionanotechnology to emit a full range of colors in one pliable pixel layer - as opposed to the several rigid layers that constitute today's screens. ""Our material is light, organic, and environmentally friendly,"" said Prof. Gazit. ""It is flexible, and a single layer emits the same range of light that requires several layers today. By using only one layer, you can minimize production costs dramatically, which will lead to lower prices for consumers as well."" From genes to screens For the purpose of the study, a part of Berger's Ph.D. thesis, the researchers tested different combinations of peptides: short protein fragments, embedded with DNA elements which facilitate the self-assembly of a unique molecular architecture. Peptides and DNA are two of the most basic building blocks of life. Each cell of every life form is composed of such building blocks. In the field of bionanotechnology, scientists utilize these building blocks to develop novel technologies with properties not available for inorganic materials such as plastic and metal. ""Our lab has been working on peptide nanotechnology for over a decade, but DNA nanotechnology is a distinct and fascinating field as well. When I started my doctoral studies, I wanted to try and converge the two approaches,"" said Berger. ""In this study, we focused on PNA - peptide nucleic acid, a synthetic hybrid molecule of peptides and DNA. We designed and synthesized different PNA sequences, and tried to build nano-metric architectures with them."" Using methods such as electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, the researchers discovered that three of the molecules they synthesized could self-assemble, in a few minutes, into ordered structures. The structures resembled the natural double-helix form of DNA, but also exhibited peptide characteristics. This resulted in a very unique molecular arrangement that reflects the duality of the new material. ""Once we discovered the DNA-like organization, we tested the ability of the structures to bind to DNA-specific fluorescent dyes,"" said Berger. ""To our surprise, the control sample, with no added dye, emitted the same fluorescence as the variable. This proved that the organic structure is itself naturally fluorescent."" Over the rainbow The structures were found to emit light in every color, as opposed to other fluorescent materials that shine only in one specific color. Moreover, light emission was observed also in response to electric voltage - which make it a perfect candidate for opto-electronic devices like display screens. The study was funded by the Momentum Fund of Ramot, TAU's technology transfer company, which also patented the new technology. The researchers are currently building a prototype of the screen and are in talks with major consumer electronics companies regarding the technology.","Published: April 1, 2015"

The research led by the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience's David Rosenberg, M.D., and Vaibhav Diwadkar, Ph.D., sheds significant light on our understanding of how brain networks contribute to obsessive-compulsive disorder in youth. The study included youth with a diagnosis of OCD and a comparison group free of psychiatric illness. The investigators used functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, to collect brain responses while participants engaged in a basic working memory task. Task difficulty was varied to evoke activity in a core brain sub-network responsible for implementing complex processes such as cognitive control. Then, using sophisticated network analyses, the investigators quantified differences in brain network function between the two groups. ""Most fundamentally, we show that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, a key region of the brain associated with cognitive control, exerts exaggerated brain network effects in OCD,"" said Dr. Diwadkar, an associate professor. ""This result provides a putative scientific framework for what clinicians have noted about OCD-related behaviors. These network-based effects have been suggested, but not explicitly demonstrated before in brain imaging data in the disorder. Our studies are perfectly aligned with the renewed emphasis of the National Institute of Mental Health to discover mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disease in the brain. If you can discover a reliable mechanism underlying disease, you have the promise of improved pathways toward treatment."" The results are highly consistent with observations in the clinic, said Dr. Rosenberg, who is a professor and the department's chair. ""Children with OCD are beset by preoccupations and can't easily move on from certain tasks and behaviors. As all complex behavior arises from brain networks, being trapped in this mode must arise from impaired brain network interactions in OCD. In our previous studies we had focused on assessing the structure and the neurochemistry of the anterior cingulate.

Veterans in the study wear a helmet lined with light-emitting diodes that apply red and near-infrared light to the scalp. They also have diodes placed in their nostrils, to deliver photons to the deeper parts of the brain. The light is painless and generates no heat. A treatment takes about 30 minutes. The therapy, though still considered ""investigational"" and not covered by most health insurance plans, is already used by some alternative medicine practitioners to treat wounds and pain. The light from the diodes has been shown to boost the output of nitric oxide near where the LEDs are placed, which improves blood flow in that location. ""We are applying a technology that's been around for a while,"" says lead investigator Dr. Margaret Naeser, ""but it's always been used on the body, for wound healing and to treat muscle aches and pains, and joint problems. We're starting to use it on the brain."" Naeser is a research linguist and speech pathologist for the Boston VA, and a research professor of neurology at Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM). She is also a licensed acupuncturist and has conducted past research on laser acupuncture to treat paralysis in stroke, and pain in carpal tunnel syndrome. The LED therapy increases blood flow in the brain, as shown on MRI scans. It also appears to have an effect on damaged brain cells, specifically on their mitochondria. These are bean-shaped subunits within the cell that put out energy in the form of a chemical known as ATP. The red and near-infrared light photons penetrate through the skull and into brain cells and spur the mitochondria to produce more ATP. That can mean clearer, sharper thinking, says Naeser. Naeser says brain damage caused by explosions, or exposure to pesticides or other neurotoxins--such as in the Gulf War--could impair the mitochondria in cells. She believes light therapy can be a valuable adjunct to standard cognitive rehabilitation, which typically involves ""exercising"" the brain in various ways to take advantage of brain plasticity and forge new neural networks. ""The light-emitting diodes add something beyond what's currently available with cognitive rehabilitation therapy,"" says Naeser. ""That's a very important therapy, but patients can go only so far with it. And in fact, most of the traumatic brain injury and PTSD cases that we've helped so far with LEDs on the head have been through cognitive rehabilitation therapy. These people still showed additional progress after the LED treatments. It's likely a combination of both methods would produce the best results."" The LED approach has its skeptics, but Naeser's group has already published some encouraging results in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Last June in the Journal of Neurotrauma, they reported the outcomes of LED therapy in 11 patients with chronic TBI, ranging in age from 26 to 62. Most of the injuries occurred in car accidents or on the athletic field. One was a battlefield injury, from an improvised explosive device (IED). Neuropsychological testing before the therapy and at several points thereafter showed gains in areas such as executive function, verbal learning, and memory. The study volunteers also reported better sleep and fewer PTSD symptoms. The study authors concluded that the pilot results warranted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial--the gold standard in medical research. That's happening now, thanks to VA support. One trial, already underway, aims to enroll 160 Gulf War veterans. Half the veterans will get the real LED therapy for 15 sessions, while the others will get a mock version, using sham lights. Then the groups will switch, so all the volunteers will end up getting the real therapy, although they won't know at which point they received it. After each veteran's last real or sham treatment, he or she will undergo tests of brain function. Naeser points out that ""because this is a blinded, controlled study, neither the participant nor the assistant applying the LED helmet and the intranasal diodes is aware whether the LEDs are real or sham. So they both wear goggles that block out the red LED light."" The near-infrared light is invisible to begin with. Besides the Gulf War study, other trials of the LED therapy are getting underway: Naeser hopes the work will validate LED therapy as a viable treatment for veterans and others with brain difficulties. She foresees potential not only for war injuries but for conditions such as depression, stroke, dementia, and even autism. ""There are going to be many applications, I think. We're just in the beginning stages right now."" U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs   press release Margaret A. Naeser, Ross Zafonte, Maxine H. Krengel, Paula I. Martin, Judith Frazier, Michael R.

The study results suggest that gaming not only improves their visual skill but also may improve their learning ability for those skills. If the association the researchers document in the journal PLoS ONE indeed proves to be causal, then the implication would be that practice not only improves performance but also augments the capacity to improve performance further. ""When we study perceptual learning we usually exclude people who have tons of video game playing time because they seem to have different visual processing. They are quicker and more accurate,"" said senior author Yuka Sasaki, associate professor (research) of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences at Brown. ""But they may be in an expert category of visual processing. We sometimes see that an expert athlete can learn movements very quickly and accurately and a musician can play the piano at the very first sight of the notes very elegantly, so maybe the learning process is also different. Maybe they can learn more efficiently and quickly as a result of training."" After all, video gaming has become a significant part of popular culture, making the study of gaming performance and its effects on perception and learning more important, said Aaron Berard, lead author and graduate student. ""In the last 20 years, video game playing as an activity has gone from simple entertainment to a serious hobby,"" he said. ""Video games are even played as a sport in some organizations today. It is important to recognize that more and more people are engaging in video games in modern society on a regular basis, which lends credit to why we should study gaming's effects on the brain."" To conduct the study, the researchers pitted nine frequent gamers against a control group of nine people who game rarely if ever. They participated in a two-day trial of visual task learning. Subjects were shown an on-screen ""texture"" of either visual or horizontal lines and had to quickly point out -- in a fraction of a second -- the one area where an anomalous texture appeared. In visual processing research this is a standard protocol called a ""texture discrimination task."" Prior studies have shown that most people can be trained to improve their performance on such tasks, but only if they are given enough time for the learning to ""consolidate"" in their mind, presumably as neural circuits embodying the learning take shape. If they move on to a second task too quickly, for example, that could interfere with their learning of the first one. Sasaki, Berard, and their co-authors wanted to find out if gamers were better able to overcome this interference, compared to non-gamers. They therefore trained the subjects on a second similar task soon after training them on the first. If in the first task the main texture was horizontal, for example, the second time it was vertical, or vice versa. The first day the subjects trained on each of the two tasks (in a randomized order). The next day they did each again (and again in a randomized order) so the researchers could assess whether they improved. To improve, a person had to reduce the milliseconds of time it took to discriminate the textures at a given level of accuracy. What the researchers found was that gamers managed to improve performance on both tasks, while non-gamers did what was expected: They improved on the second task they trained on, but not on the first. Learning the second task interfered with learning the first. The data show that gamers on average improved their combination of speed and accuracy by about 15 percent on their second task and about 11 percent on their first task. Non-gamers produced the same average 15 percent improvement on their second task, but they actually got a bit worse on the first task they learned, by about 5 percent. Despite the small number of participants, the results proved statistically significant. The exact neural mechanisms underlying visual or perceptual learning are not yet known, Sasaki said, but the study suggests that gamers may have a more efficient process for hardwiring their visual task learning than non-gamers. ""It may be possible that the vast amount of visual training frequent gamers receive over the years could help contribute to honing consolidation mechanisms in the brain, especially for visually developed skills,"" the researchers wrote. Being certain will require more research. Importantly, the study doesn't prove whether playing video games improves learning ability or whether people with an innate ability become gamers because they find gaming more rewarding. The study also has a stark gender imbalance between the nearly all-male gamer group and the nearly all-female non-gamer group. But the researchers could not find evidence in the literature for gender differences in perceptual learning that would make this disparity worrisome. By documenting these and other apparent cognitive differences between gamers and non-gamers, the field is discovering that there is more to video games than merely passing the time, Berard said. ""A lot of people still view video games as a time-wasting activity even though research is beginning to show their beneficial aspects,"" Berard said. ""If we can demonstrate that video games may actually improve some cognitive functioning, perhaps we, as a society, can embrace newer technology and media with positive application.""

In particular, depression is an increasing problem in children and teenagers. The most commonly prescribed antidepressants are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), only two of which are FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approved to treat depression in children and adolescents. However, the therapeutic benefit afforded by SSRIs in kids is very limited. Nathan Mitchell, a graduate student at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio wanted to know why the therapeutic benefit afforded by SSRIs was so limited in children and teenagers. If researchers can uncover the biological mechanisms preventing available treatments from producing antidepressant effects, scientists can then target those mechanisms to develop new antidepressants that will treat childhood and adolescent depression more effectively. SSRIs are thought to relieve depressive symptoms by increasing levels of serotonin. SSRIs do so by blocking the serotonin transporter, which acts like a vacuum cleaner to clear serotonin from the space around neurons in the brain. However, Mitchell and colleagues have recently found that there is more than one kind of ""vacuum cleaner"" for serotonin in the brain. They reasoned that the action of these auxiliary transporters may serve to undermine the therapeutic utility of blocking the serotonin transporter. To test this hypothesis, Mitchell investigated the expression and function of these auxiliary transporters in the hippocampus, a brain region critical in regulating mood. The research is being presented at the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (ASPET) Annual Meeting during Experimental Biology 2015 taking place in Boston from March 28 to April 1. Their research found that in juvenile mice there was much greater expression of one auxiliary ""vacuum cleaner for serotonin"" in particular, called the plasma membrane monoamine transporter, than in adult mice. Moreover, the serotonin transporter was less functional in juvenile mice than in adults. Like children and adolescents, the research team also found juvenile mice to be less sensitive to the effects of SSRIs in behavioral tests that provide measures of antidepressant-like activity. These results suggested that increased activity of the plasma membrane monoamine ""auxiliary vacuum cleaner"" during childhood may help to explain their poor therapeutic response to SSRIs. Another interesting outcome indicated that blocking this transporter produced antidepressant-like effects in juvenile mice, but not in adults. Together these results uncover a putative new target, the plasma membrane monoamine transporter, for the development of novel antidepressants with improved therapeutic benefit in children and teenagers and Mitchell and colleagues are continuing research to achieve this goal.

In most species, some portions of male and female brains are a different size, and often have a different number of neurons and synapses. However, scientists have known little about how this differentiation occurs. Now, a new study by researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UM SOM) has illuminated details about this process. Margaret McCarthy, PhD, professor and chairman of the Department of Pharmacology, studied brain development in newborn rats. She found that giving estradiol, a testosterone derivative, triggers a mechanism by which certain genes in the brain are ""unsilenced,"" allowing them to initiate the process of masculinization. This process involves a group of enzymes known as DNA methyltransferases, or Dnmts, which modify DNA to repress gene expression. The paper was published in the latest issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience. ""Nobody has ever shown that this is how the process works,"" said Prof. McCarthy. She collaborated with Bridget Nugent, PhD, who is now a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. ""This gives us a new understanding of how gender is determined in the brain. Prof. McCarthy and Nugent also found that inhibiting Dnmts has powerful effects, even outside the usual window of development. During prenatal development there is a restricted time frame during which the brain takes on male or female characteristics. Scientists had thought that once this window closed, it could not be reopened. But the two researchers found otherwise. They succeeded in transforming the brain of a female rat after the window had closed, giving it the characteristics of a male rat brain. Prof. McCarthy and Nugent injected Dnmt inhibitors into a specific region of the female brains, a region known as the preoptic area, or POA. In every species that's been studied, including humans, the POA plays a key role in governing male sexual behavior. The injections occurred after the first week of birth, the time when the window for brain sexual differentiation was thought to have been closed. Despite this, the preoptic area in these animals was transformed, and took on structural characteristics of a male rat. The female rats also behaved differently, displaying sexual behavior typical of male rats. In another experiment, they genetically deleted the Dnmt gene in female mice; these animals also showed male behavior patterns. ""Physically, these animals were females, but in their reproductive behavior, they were males,"" said Nugent. ""It was fascinating to see this transformation."" Prof. McCarthy has focused much of her work on the neuroscience of sex differences. In previous research she found sex and gender differences in levels of a protein associated with language acquisition and development. This finding may be associated with higher levels of communication among females in some species. Intriguingly, the latest study also found that inflammatory immune cells known as microglia appear to play a role in masculinization, in part through their production of prostaglandins, a neurochemical normally associated with illness. In recent years, scientists have increasingly realized that the immune system is integral to the development of the brain; Prof. McCarthy and her group are the first to show that it is also important for establishment of sex differences in the brain. The current discovery is another piece in that puzzle; they showed that Dnmt enzymes control expression of genes that play a role in inflammation and immunity, and also in the sexual differentiation of the brain. Prof. McCarthy is now doing additional research on the links between the immune system and brain sex differences. ""Prof. McCarthy's work provides new insight into brain development and gender,"" said Dean E.

In the study published in Molecular Psychiatry, Mady Hornig, MD, and colleagues used immunoassay testing methods to measure levels of 51 immune biomarkers called cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid of 32 people with ME/CFS for an average of seven years, 40 with multiple sclerosis, and 19 non-diseased controls. The researchers found that levels of most cytokines, including the inflammatory immune molecule interleukin 1, were depressed in individuals with ME/CFS compared with the other two groups, matching what was seen in a blood study in patients who had the disease for more than three years. One cytokine eotaxin was elevated in the ME/CFS and MS groups, but not in the control group.  We now know that the same changes to the immune system that we recently reported in the blood of people with ME/CFS with long-standing disease are also present in the central nervous system,  says Dr. Hornig, professor of Epidemiology and director of translational research at the Center for Infection and Immunity at the Mailman School.  These immune differences may contribute to symptoms in both the peripheral parts of the body and the brain, from muscle weakness to brain fog.   Diagnosis of ME/CFS is now based on clinical criteria. Our findings offer the hope of objective diagnostic tests for disease as well as the potential for therapies that correct the imbalance in cytokine levels seen in people with ME/CFS at different stages of their disease,  adds W. Ian Lipkin, MD, John Snow Professor of Epidemiology and director of the Center for Infection and Immunity.  There is precedent for use of human monoclonal antibodies that regulate the immune response in a wide range of disorders from rheumatoid arthritis to multiple sclerosis.

The technique, demonstrated with a 56-year-old man whose right hand had been amputated, uses non-invasive brain monitoring, capturing brain activity to determine what parts of the brain are involved in grasping an object. With that information, researchers created a computer program, or brain-machine interface (BMI), that harnessed the subject s intentions and allowed him to successfully grasp objects, including a water bottle and a credit card. The subject grasped the selected objects 80 percent of the time using a high-tech bionic hand fitted to the amputee s stump. Previous studies involving either surgically implanted electrodes or myoelectric control, which relies upon electrical signals from muscles in the arm, have shown similar success rates, according to the researchers. Jose Luis Contreras-Vidal, a neuroscientist and engineer at UH, said the non-invasive method offers several advantages: It avoids the risks of surgically implanting electrodes by measuring brain activity via scalp electroencephalogram, or EEG. And myoelectric systems aren t an option for all people, because they require that neural activity from muscles relevant to hand grasping remain intact. The results of the study were published March 30 in Frontiers in Neuroscience, in the Neuroprosthetics section. Contreras-Vidal, Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen Distinguished Professor of electrical and computer engineering at UH, was lead author of the paper, along with graduate students Harshavardhan Ashok Agashe, Andrew Young Paek and Yuhang Zhang. The work, funded by the National Science Foundation, demonstrates for the first time EEG-based BMI control of a multi-fingered prosthetic hand for grasping by an amputee. It also could lead to the development of better prosthetics, Contreras-Vidal said. Beyond demonstrating that prosthetic control is possible using non-invasive EEG, researchers said the study offers a new understanding of the neuroscience of grasping and will be applicable to rehabilitation for other types of injuries, including stroke and spinal cord injury.  T he study subjects   five able-bodied, right-handed men and women, all in their 20s, as well as the amputee   were tested using a 64-channel active EEG, with electrodes attached to the scalp to capture brain activity. Contreras-Vidal said brain activity was recorded in multiple areas, including the motor cortex and areas known to be used in action observation and decision-making, and occurred between 50 milliseconds and 90 milliseconds before the hand began to grasp. That provided evidence that the brain predicted the movement, rather than reflecting it, he said.  Current upper limb neuroprosthetics restore some degree of functional ability, but fail to approach the ease of use and dexterity of the natural hand, particularly for grasping movements,  the researchers wrote, noting that work with invasive cortical electrodes has been shown to allow some hand control but not at the level necessary for all daily activities.  Further, the inherent risks associated with surgery required to implant electrodes, along with the long-term stability of recorded signals, is of concern.   Here we show that it is feasible to extract detailed information on intended grasping movements to various objects in a natural, intuitive manner, from a plurality of scalp EEG signals.  Until now, this was thought to be possible only with brain signals acquired invasively inside or on the surface of the brain. Researchers first recorded brain activity and hand movement in the able-bodied volunteers as they picked up five objects, each chosen to illustrate a different type of grasp: a soda can, a compact disc, a credit card, a small coin and a screwdriver. The recorded data were used to create decoders of neural activity into motor signals, which successfully reconstructed the grasping movements. They then fitted the amputee subject with a computer-controlled neuroprosthetic hand and told him to observe and imagine himself controlling the hand as it moved and grasped the objects.   The subject s EEG data, along with information about prosthetic hand movements gleaned from the able-bodied volunteers, were used to build the algorithm. Contreras-Vidal said additional practice, along with refining the algorithm, could increase the success rate to 100 percent.

Now a team of University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) researchers has shown for the first time in a large cohort of patients that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), sometimes referred to as shock treatment, change certain areas of the brain that play a role in how people feel, learn and respond to positive and negative environmental factors. The team imaged the hippocampus and amgydala in patients before, during and after undergoing ECT and compared those images to healthy control subjects. They also showed that the hippocampus changes, or increases in size, correlated to improved mood in patients with major depression and indicated how well they were responding to treatment. Additionally, using leading-edge methods to look at brain shape, the team showed that parts of these structures change more with treatment, providing vital clues to how the connections in the brain may be used to select for patients who will respond well to treatment. That would also result in sparing those patients who won't respond from months of taking drugs that ultimately won't work for them, said study senior author Katherine L. Narr, an associate professor of neurology. ""Major depression is common, affects all ages, races and ethnic groups and has a serious consequence on people's family lives and work,"" Narr said. ""People with depression also are at higher risk for suicide, which accounts for more deaths than car accidents, natural disasters and war each year on average. Unfortunately, standard types of medication used to treat major depression take a long time to work, and for at least a third of people, the medication will not work well enough to provide any real help."" The study appears in the early online edition of the journal Biological Psychiatry. ECT, which has been used for more than 50 years, carries with it a certain stigma. However, within the last decade, advances in anesthesia, electrical stimulation equipment and new evidence about electrode lead placement have improved safety and reduced side effects, said study first author Shantanu H. Joshi, an assistant professor of neurology. Further advances in high-resolution MRI also allow the measurement of the induced brain changes with improved accuracy and precision. ""ECT has been shown to be very effective for treating patients with major depression who don't respond well to other treatments,"" Joshi said. ""During the treatment course, ECT leads to plastic changes in the brain that are linked with improvements in mood. Specifically, we saw the hippocampus and amygdala - important for memory and emotion - are shown to increase in size. People with smaller hippocampal size prior to starting treatment are less likely to respond as well to treatment. While our research investigates structural neuroplasticity in depression in response to ECT, our findings are considered to be of much broader interest to the field."" In addition to ECT, the team expects that the effects shown would extend to more standard, less rapidly acting antidepressant treatments and could be used to predict patient response. In this study, the team imaged 43 patients undergoing ECT at three time points, before beginning treatment, after the second ECT session and within one week of completing treatment, resulting in 129 brain scans. They also imaged 32 healthy controls twice, and compared those images to the ECT patients. Going forward, the UCLA team will examine the relationship between the hippocampal structural neuroplasticity and its neurochemistry in terms of the metabolite response, which has important implications for understanding the brain's metabolic regulation and the excitation and suppression as a response to ECT. Additionally, the hippocampal and amgydalar shape will be used as features for classification and prediction of depression diagnosis and treatment response using advanced machine-learning techniques. The changes in the hippocampal and the amgydalar structure will be further investigated with regards to novel disease maintenance treatments along with relapse/recurrence rates. Major depression affects 350 million people each year and leads to enormous personal suffering, loss of productivity and is aburden to family, the health care system and the economy. Finding better ways to select patients for treatments that will alleviate their symptoms would go a long way to reducing that suffering, Narr said. ""Our findings newly show that hippocampal structure prior to ECT may be an important indicator of treatment outcome,"" the study states. ""That is, patients with smaller hippocampal volumes at baseline are shown to more likely exhibit increases in volume with ECT and to show concomitant improvements in clinical symptoms. Results further indicate that both clinical response to ECT and ECT-induced changes in volume occur rapidly."" University of California, Los Angeles Shantanu H. Joshi, Randall T.

Kinneret Savitsky, Ph.D., CEO of BioLineRx, remarked,  2014 marks a year of significant progress for BioLineRx on multiple fronts, both from a product development perspective, as well as from a business perspective. We have continued our focus on the therapeutic areas of oncology and immunology, while increasing the emphasis on our clinical-stage programs.   During the past year, we significantly enhanced and expanded the development strategy for our unique BL-8040 cancer therapy platform across a variety of hematological indications. Results to date from our ongoing Phase 2a clinical study of BL-8040 in relapsed and refractory AML patients continue to show substantial mobilization of leukemic cells from the bone marrow and robust induction of cancer cell apoptosis, as well as excellent safety and tolerability. Top-line results from this study are expected in the second half of 2015. BL-8040 is also in the midst of a Phase 1 safety and efficacy study in stem cell mobilization, with top-line results expected by the end of this month. We eagerly await the data from both of these important studies. In addition, we recently expanded our clinical strategy for BL-8040 to include new clinical trials in three additional hematological indications, all of which are expected to commence by the end of the second quarter of this year. We look forward to executing our comprehensive development plan for this promising treatment platform and to reaching several meaningful value inflection points during 2015.   With regard to BL-7010, our product for the treatment of celiac disease, we are very pleased with the positive results we reported for the Phase 1/2 safety study completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, including the determination of the optimal safe dose for continued development. We are also very encouraged that the results further support previous preclinical data showing that BL-7010 is not absorbed systemically, which will likely support a medical-device classification and an expedited development pathway for the product in Europe. We are now conducting additional non-clinical studies and formulation development for BL-7010 in preparation for the upcoming efficacy study, which we plan to initiate in the second half of this year.   In December 2014, our partner Bellerophon reached a significant milestone in the development of BL-1040 for the prevention of ventricular remodeling following AMI - the completion of enrollment in the large CE Mark registration trial that has been ongoing for the past three years. We look forward to the top-line results from this trial, expected in mid-2015.   During the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced two significant business development achievements. First and foremost, we entered into a multi-year strategic collaboration with Novartis for the screening and co-development of therapeutic candidates through clinical proof-of-concept. As part of the collaboration, Novartis made an equity investment in BioLineRx of $10 million. We are very excited about the future potential of this collaboration, and view it as a strong validation of our core competencies by a world leader in our industry. In addition, we also announced the out-licensing to Omega Pharma of BL-5010, our skin lesion product, which we hope will begin to provide a royalty stream to us beginning in 2016.   Following the successful completion of our $29 million follow-on public offering earlier this month, we have a strong balance sheet, with enough cash to carry out our operating plan for at least the next three years. We expect to reach multiple significant catalysts during this period of time, both in the short term during 2015, as well as in 2016 and 2017.  Financial Results for Year Ended December 31, 2014 Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were NIS 42.5 million ($10.9 million), a decrease of NIS 1.6 million ($0.4 million), or 3.7%, compared to NIS 44.1 million ($11.3 million) for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease resulted primarily from termination of the BL-1020 CLARITY clinical trial in March 2013 and certain one-time costs associated with several clinical-stage projects in 2013, partially offset by increased spending on BL-8040, BL-7010 and BL-5010 in 2014. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were NIS 5.7 million ($1.5 million), an increase of NIS 1.6 million ($0.4 million), or 38.6%, compared to NIS 4.1 million ($1.1 million) for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase resulted primarily from professional fees related to increased business development activities, including professional services related to the collaboration agreement with Novartis and the out-licensing agreement with Omega regarding BL-5010. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were NIS 13.6 million ($3.5 million), an increase of NIS 0.4 million ($0.1 million) or 2.8%, compared to NIS 13.2 million ($3.4 million) for the year ended December 31, 2013. The small increase resulted primarily from an increase in salary-related payments. The Company s operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 amounted to NIS 61.7 million ($15.9 million), compared with an operating loss of NIS 61.4 million ($15.8 million) for the year ended December 31, 2013. The Company recognized net non-operating income of NIS 11.0 million ($2.8 million) for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of NIS 6.8 million ($1.7 million), compared to net non-operating income of NIS 4.2 million ($1.1 million) for the year ended December 31, 2013. Non-operating income for both periods primarily relates to fair-value adjustments of liabilities on account of warrants issued in the private and direct placements conducted in February 2012 and 2013. These fair-value adjustments were highly influenced by the Company s share price at each period end (revaluation date). Net financial income amounted to NIS 11.2 million ($2.9 million) for the year ended December 31, 2014, a change of NIS 15.5 million ($4.0 million), compared to net financial expenses of NIS 4.3 million ($1.1 million) for the year ended December 31, 2013. Net financial income and expenses result primarily from changes in the average exchange rate of the dollar in relation to the NIS during the respective periods, which have a direct effect on the Company s net assets denominated in dollars. The Company s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 amounted to NIS 39.6 million ($10.2 million), compared with a net loss of NIS 61.4 million ($15.8 million) for the year ended December 31, 2013. The Company held NIS 134.9 million ($34.7 million) in cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits as of December 31, 2014. In March 2015, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its American Depositary Shares for gross proceeds of $28.8 million. Net cash used in operating activities was NIS 56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with NIS 70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The NIS 14.1 million decrease in net cash used in operating activities during 2014 resulted primarily from a large decrease in net trade payables and accruals during the 2013 period. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was NIS 70.7 million, compared to net cash used for investing activities of NIS 19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The changes in cash flows from investing activities relate primarily to investments in, and maturities of, short-term bank deposits and other investments during the respective periods. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was NIS 117.8 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of NIS 55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The cash flows from financing activities in 2014 primarily reflect the underwritten public offering in March 2014 and the investment by Novartis in December 2014. The cash flows from financing activities in 2013 reflect the direct placement to OrbiMed completed in February 2013, as well as funding under the previous share purchase agreement with LPC.","Published: March 31, 2015"

Much of this movement is caused by the traditional carbon substrates used to support frozen samples in the electron microscope. The new gold supports nearly eliminate this motion resulting in improved image contrast and quality.  The gold supports were developed at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology by Dr Lori A Passmore and Dr Christopher J Russo and are described in Science (2014) Dec 12;346 (6215):1377-80 (doi:10.1126/science.1259530). A US provisional patent application for the technology was filed on 13 August 2013 followed by a PCT application on 20 June 2014. Dr Karen Law, Business Manager, MRC Technology, said:  We are delighted to have helped translate innovative research into a commercial reality. It is an exciting technology that will now be readily available to researchers, and will enable the elucidation of protein structures that were previously difficult using existing cryo-EM products.  Mr Kay Pfennighaus, Managing Director, Quantifoil, said:  We are excited to be part of this revolutionary progress in electron microscopy and prosperous collaboration with the MRC. Quantifoil hopes to strengthen its market position and to prove again its capabilities as a leading partner to transfer innovative research results into usable products.

For researchers around the world, the CRISPR-Cas9 technique is an exciting innovation because it is faster and cheaper than previous methods. Now, using a molecular trick, Dr. Van Trung Chu and Professor Klaus Rajewsky of the Max Delbr ck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) Berlin-Buch and Dr. Ralf K hn, MDC and Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), have found a solution to considerably increase the efficiency of precise genetic modifications by up to eightfold.  What we used to do in years, we can now achieve in months,  said gene researcher and immunologist Klaus Rajewsky, indicating the power of this new genome-editing technology. CRISPR-Cas9 not only speeds up research considerably - at the same time it is much more efficient, cheaper and also easier to handle than the methods used so far. The CRISPR-Cas9 technology allows researchers to transiently introduce DNA double-strand breaks into the genome of cells or model organisms at genes of choice. In these artificially produced strand breaks, they can insert or cut out genes and change the genetic coding according to their needs. Mammalian cells are able to repair DNA damage in their cells using two different repair mechanisms. The homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway enables the insertion of preplanned genetic modifications using engineered DNA molecules that share identical sequence regions with the targeted gene and which are recognized as a repair template. Thus, HDR repair is very precise but occurs only at low frequency in mammalian cells. The other repair system, called non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is more efficient in nature but less precise, since it readily reconnects free DNA ends without repair template, thereby frequently deleting short sequences from the genome. Therefore, NHEJ repair can only be used to create short genomic deletions, but does not support precise gene modification or the insertion and replacement of gene segments. Many researchers, including Van Trung Chu, Klaus Rajewsky and Ralf K hn, are seeking to promote the HDR repair pathway to make gene modification in the laboratory more precise in order to avoid editing errors and to increase efficiency. The MDC researchers succeeded in increasing the efficiency of the more precisely working HDR repair system by temporarily inhibiting the most dominant repair protein of NHEJ, the enzyme DNA Ligase IV. In their approach they used various inhibitors such as proteins and small molecules.  But we also used a trick of nature and blocked Ligase IV with the proteins of adeno viruses. Thus we were able to increase the efficiency of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology up to eightfold,  Ralf K hn explained. For example, they succeeded in inserting a gene into a predefined position in the genome (knock-in) in more than 60 per cent of all manipulated mouse cells. K hn has just recently joined the MDC and is head of the research group for  iPS cell based disease modeling . Before coming to the MDC, he was on the research staff of Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen.  The expertise of Ralf K hn is very important for gene research at MDC and especially for my research group,  Klaus Rajewsky said. Concurrent with the publication of the article by the MDC researchers, Nature Biotechnology published another, related paper on CRISPR-Cas9 technology. It comes from the laboratory of Hidde Ploegh of the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, MA, USA. Somatic gene therapy with CRISPR-Cas9 is a goalThe new CRISPR-Cas9 technology, developed in 2012, is already used in the laboratory to correct genetic defects in mice. Researchers also plan to modify the genetic set up of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), which can be differentiated into specialized cell types or tissues. That is, researchers are able to use the new tool to introduce patient-derived mutations into the genome of iPS cells for studying the onset of human diseases.  Another future goal, however, is to use CRISPR-Cas9 for somatic gene therapy in humans with severe diseases,  Klaus Rajewsky pointed out. Klaus Rajewsky:  One of the hottest topics in biomedicine and an innovative field The CRISPR-Cas9 technology is one of the hottest topics in biomedical research and an innovative field,  said Klaus Rajewsky. He pointed out that the new capabilities to precisely edit the genome has sparked off an intense debate in the USA and elsewhere, since the new precision tools could also be applied to modifying the genome in human germ cells or embryos. Although manipulation of the human germline is prohibited by law in many countries, including Germany, a global ban is not in effect. The MDC researchers are fascinated by the new opportunities the CRISPR-Cas9 system offers for biomedical research, but strictly reject genetic modification of the human germline.","Published: March 31, 2015"

They are in cosmetics and shampoo, food packaging and plastic containers, clothing and building materials, furniture and electronic devices. Although the U.S. now produces more than 500 million tons of synthetic chemicals annually, a major  toxicological information gap  has developed regarding the risks they pose to human health and the environment. According to a number of government reports, less than 10 percent of the 80,000-odd chemicals in general commerce have been tested adequately to determine their health risks. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has announced the establishment of three new centers to develop alternative approaches for toxicity testing that could help fill the troubling gap. One is the Vanderbilt-Pittsburgh Resource for Predictive Toxicology (VPROMPT), which will receive $6 million for four years to develop toxicity test procedures based on three-dimensional human cell cultures, rather than the combination of standard two-dimensional cell cultures and whole animal testing that has been de rigeur until now. VPROMPT is a collaboration between investigators at Vanderbilt University and the University of Pittsburgh. The lead principal investigator is M. Shane Hutson, associate professor of physics at Vanderbilt. The five co-principal investigators are Research Associate Professor Lisa McCawley, Professor Kevin Osteen, director of the Women s Reproductive Health Research Center, and Gordon A. Cain University Professor John Wikswo at Vanderbilt and Rocky Tuan, director of the Center for Cellular and Molecular Engineering, and D. Lansing Taylor, director of the Drug Discovery Institute, at Pittsburgh. Given the situation we face, traditional toxicology testing procedures are simply inadequate,  said Hutson.  A full toxicological evaluation for a single chemical using traditional methods can cost millions of dollars, involve hundreds of test animals and take years to complete. And, as if the time and cost weren t bad enough, existing tests haven t proven very good at predicting chemicals  effects on humans.  The primary goal of the new center is to develop a series of 3-D human cell cultures that are heavily wired up with different sensors to record how they respond when exposed to small concentrations of potentially toxic chemicals. The forefront of cell biology is moving away from traditional 2-D culture of a single cell type towards 3-D cell culture of multiple cell types that more closely mimic the microenvironment of particular organs. These more complex cultures exhibit cell behaviors that are much more like those seen by cells in living animals. By making sure the cultures use human cells, the researchers hope to avoid misleading toxicity results caused by differences in how animal and human cells respond to the same chemical.  We are very excited about the new Vanderbilt/Pittsburgh partnership to develop and apply innovative tissue-on-a-chip technologies to identify and evaluate potential harmful agents in the environment, and contribute towards improving the nation s health,  said Tuan. The researchers will develop four test platforms: one using liver cells; one using fetal membrane cells; one using mammary gland cells; and one using cells involved in limb and joint growth. They selected the liver because one of its functions is to remove toxic substances from blood coming from the digestive system before they can spread throughout the body. The fetal membrane and mammary gland cells were included because of the roles they play in reproduction. And they choose the cells involved in limb and joint growth because their role in development. The researchers will expose the 3-D cultures to a battery of previously identified toxic chemicals that have been extensively studied using traditional methods so they can compare the results and determine how well the procedures they have developed predict the results of the older tests.","Published: March 31, 2015"

The model also shows, however, that some TB bacteria can find a way to get around that protection, which helps explain how latent infections turn into active and transmissible disease. More than 2 billion people worldwide are thought to be infected with TB bacteria, and an estimated 1.3 million people died of TB in 2012. People who are infected can harbor the bacterium without symptoms for decades, but about one in 10 will develop active disease characterized by a chronic cough and chest pain.  Many people in the United States think of TB as a distant disease that doesn t pose much of a threat. But the recent discovery of latent infections in Kansas school children who had contact with a single actively ill patient shows how widespread infection can occur with minimal exposure,  said Larry Schlesinger, professor and chair of microbial infection and immunity at The Ohio State University and senior author of the study.  This research might help us better predict what puts people with latent infection at higher risk of later developing active disease.  The study is published in a recent issue of the journal mBio. In the study, scientists used human cells to create a model of a step in the immune response when immune cells gather together around a cluster of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells, creating what is called a granuloma. Researchers have known granuloma formulation is vital to keeping TB at bay, but haven t been able to observe cell behavior in these clusters until now. Knowing more about the intricacies of this collection of cells could speed testing of experimental drugs and establish a new part of the immune response to consider targeting with therapies, said Schlesinger, also director of the Center for Microbial Interface Biology at Ohio State. New therapies are badly needed because the antibiotics used to treat both active and latent infections are becoming less effective with the emergence of drug-resistant bacterial strains. The researchers created granuloma-like structures in cell cultures by adding TB bacterial cells to human white blood cell samples from people with and without latent TB infection. The cells from people with latent infection started forming large clusters as early as four days after infection, while cells from uninfected people took longer to produce smaller protective structures. Compared to samples from uninfected people, the granuloma model containing immune cells from people with latent infection was a more effective fighter against bacteria in numerous ways: More immune cells were activated, and these cells controlled the bacterial load better. They also produced more protective proteins important to an immune response and were more capable of staving off the bacteria s efforts to use fatty acids and sugars for energy to help them grow. But the study showed there is a downside to all of this heightened activity. Bacteria in these high-pressure immune environments were more likely to activate genes that let them adapt by changing their metabolism, giving the TB cells a place to thrive for the long term.  This model using human cells provides evidence that there is an immune response generated during latency that reduces Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth and thus is host protective,  Schlesinger said.  At the same time, we can see that bacteria are adapting early in this environment, suggesting that at least a subset can develop into what we call persisters. These persisters are the bacteria that would have the potential to reactivate later to cause active disease. ","Published: March 31, 2015"

The company, DeCode Genetics, based in Reykjav k, says it has collected full DNA sequences on 10,000 individuals. And because people on the island are closely related, DeCode says it can now also extrapolate to accurately guess the DNA makeup of nearly all other 320,000 citizens of that country, including those who never participated in its studies. That s raising complex medical and ethical issues about whether DeCode, which is owned by the U.S. biotechnology company Amgen, will be able to inform members of the public if they are at risk for fatal diseases. K ri Stef nsson, the doctor who is founder and CEO of DeCode, says he is worried about mutations in a gene called BRCA2 that convey a sharply increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. DeCode s data can now identify about 2,000 people with the gene mutation across Iceland s population, and Stef nsson said that the company has been in negotiations with health authorities about whether to alert them.  We could save these people from dying prematurely, but we are not, because we as a society haven t agreed on that,  says Stef nsson.  I personally think that not saving people with these mutations is a crime. This is an enormous risk to a large number of people.  The Icelandic Ministry of Welfare said a special committee had been formed to regulate such  incidental  findings and would propose regulations by the end of the year. The technique used by DeCode to predict people s genes offers clues to the future of so-called precision medicine in other countries, including the U.S., where this year President Barack Obama called for researchers to assemble a giant database of one million people (see  U.S to Develop DNA Study of One Million People ). A large enough U.S. database could also be used to infer genes of people whether or not they had joined it, says Stef nsson, and could raise similar questions about whether and how to report health hazards to the public.  This technique can be applied to any population,  says Myles Axton, chief editor of Nature Genetics, the journal in which DeCode today presented some of its findings. He said the tiny island s detailed genealogical records are why  it was achieved first in Iceland.  Various legal and ethical obstacles currently prevent DeCode from warning people who are at risk. Volunteers who signed up for DeCode s studies were promised anonymity, and also that they wouldn t learn of research findings. Bioethicists recognize that people have a right  not to know  of genetic hazards, which means they can t simply be told.  The rule is that you can only use and expose genetic data if you have the permission from the individual in question,  says G sli P lsson, an anthropologist at the University of Iceland.  But this is beyond informed consent. People are not even in the studies, they haven t submitted any consent or even a sample, yet the company claims to have knowledge about these people and that there is a health risk.  P lsson says traditional notions of medical ethics are now in open conflict with the aims and capabilities of precision medicine. He believes such standards will need to be adjusted in fundamental ways in the future, so that more weight is given to public health benefits over individual privacy rights. The life expectancy of women with the BRAC2 mutation is 12 years less than for women without it because 86 percent of those who have it will develop cancer. Men are also affected because the mutation raises the chance of prostate cancer. Stefansson says many of those deaths could be avoided by preventive surgery, like a mastectomy.  We could in Iceland, at the push of a button, find all women with a mutation in the BRCA2 gene,  says Stef nsson.  It is one tiny little example of what you can do. You can use this in preventive medicine like never before.  DeCode s data might also be able to predict who in the population is at elevated relative risk for Alzheimer s disease or who has an undiagnosed learning disability. DeCode was started in 1996 with the idea of linking DNA research to Iceland s national health system (see  Population Inc. ). The country s situation is unique because of its carefully kept genealogical records, which go back to the Ninth Century, when the island was settled. That also means most Icelanders are at least distant cousins. DeCode has generated rough gene maps, called genotypes, on about 150,000 Icelanders. More recently, advances in DNA sequencing technology have allowed it to obtain complete genome sequences of about 10,000 people, Stef nsson says, or about one in 30 Icelanders. Results from the first 2,636 full genomes were reported by the company in Nature Genetics. Combined with genealogical tables, these data are what allow DeCode to  impute  the genomes of nearly everyone born of Icelandic parents. That is because once the full genome of some people in a family tree is known, the genes of the others can be inferred. Sean Harper, head of R&D at Amgen, calls DeCode s ability to guess people s DNA a  conundrum.  He says it is not an unfamiliar problem to geneticists, however, since routine DNA tests of one person often reveal information about close relatives. But it has never before occurred at the level of an entire nation.  It s a gray area from a bioethics perspective, but we would be inclined to provide the data or at least a notice,  says Harper. He says Amgen, which uses gene information from DeCode to guide its drug research, had no plans to charge anyone for the risk information it has developed.  It would not be appropriate [to] try to make it a commercial process,  he says. The U.S. lacks a similar national database, although some private companies, like 23andMe and Ancestry.com, have generated rough gene maps of several million people altogether. The National Institutes of Health is planning to spend millions in the coming years on accumulating full genome data on tens of thousands of people. That means the entire world will soon confront the same types of ethical dilemmas that Iceland now faces, says P lsson.  Do you have the right to fiddle with people s lives on a massive scale? You can tell your neighbor,  You are smoking too much.  But it s another thing to approach 1,000 people and say,  You have the BRCA2 mutation,    he says.","Published: March 31, 2015"

Zhang, PhD led a team of bioengineers from the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth in demonstrating a novel system that couples nano-engineered particles and microfluidic chips for capturing and manipulating circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The microscale immunoassay can be further interfaced with a fluorescent microscope for cancer cell imaging. Their paper, ""Microscale Magnetic Field Modulation for Enhanced Capture and Distribution of Rare Circulating Tumor Cells,"" was published in Scientific Reports, Nature Publishing Group. ""This project demonstrates that a relatively simple blood test may eventually be able to provide unambiguous information to doctors about particular cancers in individuals,"" said Zhang. Live cells represent vital model systems for studying organism development and human disease. Invasive cancers shed tumor cells into the blood and, by detecting those cells at an early stage, physicians will be able to determine a patient's prognosis and best alternatives for therapies. The capture and immunophenotyping of CTCs shed by cancers at an early stage, and postulated as the mechanism of development of recalcitrant metastatic disease, is envisioned to revolutionize risk assessment, treatment selection, response monitoring, and development of novel therapies. Zhang's team focused on creating a new interface between living cells and hybrid microsystems, which enabled rigorous design, modeling, manufacturing, and validation of high-performance and massively deployable bio-analytical microsystems for point-of-care and globally-relevant diagnostic applications. ""The concept is to use novel cell-machine interfaces, integrated sensing, actuation and biomarker recognition functionalities to isolate these rare cells (1 per 109 hematologic cells) from whole blood to determine malignancy unambiguously,"" Zhang said. ""We will base the quantitative assessment on multiple tumor markers."" The Dartmouth group demonstrated they can effectively combine the benefits of immunomagnetic assay with microfluidic technology for high-throughput CTC screening. This resulted in a high sensitivity assay for increased cell capture rate and reduced cell aggregation that will be suitable for down-stream analyses of CTCs at the single cell level. Zhang's goal is to bring this technology from the bench to the clinics, enabling doctors to diagnose and manage cancer via simple blood tests. Operationalizing this technology will potentially increase the cure rate for cancers such as breast cancer.","Published: March 31, 2015"

Consumers are nearly 100 times more likely to get foodborne illness from drinking raw milk than they are from drinking pasteurized milk. In fact, the researchers determined that raw milk was associated with over half of all milk-related foodborne illness, even though only an estimated 3.5% of the U.S. population consumes raw milk. Based on their findings, the researchers discourage the consumption of raw milk, which some claim is healthier and tastes better than pasteurized milk. They note that the risks are better understood than the benefits, and that further research is needed to determine whether the health benefit claims are legitimate. The CLF analysis was prepared at the request of the Maryland House of Delegates  Health and Operations Committee as lawmakers considered relaxing regulations that currently prohibit the sale of unpasteurized milk in Maryland. In the 2014 legislative session, House Bill 3 aimed to legalize the on-farm sale of unpasteurized milk in Maryland. The bill was tabled as legislators considered the issue. The research team presented its report to the House of Delegates last month. Raw milk has become more popular in recent years, even though it is only available for direct purchase at farms in many states. Advocates believe that raw milk, which contains more natural antibodies, proteins and bacteria than pasteurized milk, is healthier, cleaner, tastes better and reduces lactose intolerance and allergies in certain people. Pasteurization, named after Louis Pasteur, involves heating milk to destroy microbes that may have entered the milk supply from fecal contamination, dairy operations, cow udders or other sources. The treated milk is then hermetically sealed to prevent recontamination.  Ultimately, the scientific literature showed that the risk of foodborne illness from raw milk is over 100 times greater than the risk of foodborne illness from pasteurized milk,  says report lead author, Benjamin Davis, a CLF-Lerner Fellow and doctoral candidate in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health s Department of Environmental Health Sciences.  Although potential benefits related to the consumption of raw milk would benefit from further investigation, we believe that from a public health perspective it is a far safer choice to discourage the consumption of raw milk.  For their study, a team of investigators led by Keeve Nachman, PhD, director of the Public Health and Food Production Program at CLF and an assistant professor with the Bloomberg School, screened approximately 1,000 articles and reviewed 81 published journal articles relevant to the health risks and benefits of consuming raw cow s milk. Microbial contaminants commonly found in milk include infectious Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Listeria species along with the Escherichia coli type O157:H7. These bacteria can cause foodborne illness in humans, including diarrhea, vomiting, cramping, fevers, and sometimes more serious consequences such as kidney failure or death.  The risks of consuming raw milk instead of pasteurized milk are well established in the scientific literature, and in some cases can have severe or even fatal consequences,  notes co-author Cissy Li, a CLF research assistant and doctoral candidate with the Bloomberg School s Department of Environmental Health Sciences.

To help scientists make sense of this  brain big data,  researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have used data mining to create www.neuroelectro.org, a publicly available website that acts like Wikipedia, indexing physiological information about neurons. The site will help to accelerate the advance of neuroscience research by providing a centralized resource for collecting and comparing data on neuronal function. A description of the data available and some of the analyses that can be performed using the site are published online by the Journal of Neurophysiology. The neurons in the brain can be divided into approximately 300 different types based on their physical and functional properties. Researchers have been studying the function and properties of many different types of neurons for decades. The resulting data is scattered across tens of thousands of papers in the scientific literature. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon turned to data mining to collect and organize these data in a way that will make possible, for the first time, new methods of analysis.  If we want to think about building a brain or re-engineering the brain, we need to know what parts we re working with,  said Nathan Urban, interim provost and director of Carnegie Mellon s BrainHubSM neuroscience initiative.  We know a lot about neurons in some areas of the brain, but very little about neurons in others. To accelerate our understanding of neurons and their functions, we need to be able to easily determine whether what we already know about some neurons can be applied to others we know less about.  Shreejoy J. Tripathy, who worked in Urban s lab when he was a graduate student in the joint Carnegie Mellon/University of Pittsburgh Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC) Program in Neural Computation, selected more than 10,000 published papers that contained physiological data describing how neurons responded to various inputs. He used text mining algorithms to  read  each of the papers. The text mining software found the portions of each paper that identified the type of neuron studied and then isolated the electrophysiological data related to the properties of that neuronal type. It also retrieved information about how each of the experiments in the literature was completed, and corrected the data to account for any differences that might be caused by the format of the experiment. Overall, Tripathy, who is now a postdoc at the University of British Columbia, was able to collect and standardize data for approximately 100 different types of neurons, which he published on the website www.neuroelectro.org. Since the data on the website was collected using text mining, the researchers realized that it was likely to contain errors related to extraction and standardization. Urban and his group validated much of the data, but they also created a mechanism that allows site users to flag data for further evaluation. Users also can contribute new data with minimal intervention from site administrators, similar to Wikipedia.  It s a dynamic environment in which people can collect, refine and add data,  said Urban, who is the Dr. Frederick A. Schwertz Distinguished Professor of Life Sciences and a member of the CNBC.  It will be a useful resource to people doing neuroscience research all over the world.  Ultimately, the website will help researchers find groups of neurons that share the same physiological properties, which could provide a better understanding of how a neuron functions. For example, if a researcher finds that a type of neuron in the brain s neocortex fires spontaneously, they can look up other neurons that fire spontaneously and access research papers that address this type of neuron. Using that information, they can quickly form hypotheses about whether or not the same mechanisms are at play in both the newly discovered and previously studied neurons. To demonstrate how neuroelectro.org could be used, the researchers compared the electrophysiological data from more than 30 neuron types that had been most heavily studied in the literature. These included pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, which are responsible for memory, and dopamine neurons in the midbrain, thought to be responsible for reward-seeking behaviors and addiction, among others. The site was able to find many expected similarities between the different types of neurons, and some similarities that were a surprise to researchers. Those surprises represent promising areas for future research. In ongoing work, the Carnegie Mellon researchers are comparing the data on neuroelectro.org with other kinds of data, including data on neurons  patterns of gene expression. For example, Urban s group is using another publicly available resource, the Allen Brain Atlas, to find whether groups of neurons with similar electrical function have similar gene expression.  It would take a lot of time, effort and money to determine both the physiological properties of a neuron and its gene expression,  Urban said.  Our website will help guide this research, making it much more efficient.  Carnegie Mellon University  Original reporting by: Jocelyn DuffyShreejoy J. Tripathy, Shawn D.

Finding cancer cells that have spread and threaten to grow into metastatic tumors is often a life-and-death matter. Now, a spinoff from the University of Wisconsin-Madison called Cellectar Biosciences is developing molecules that bind to more than 60 types of cancer. Several are being tested in early-stage clinical trials, including one for brain cancer. These custom-made molecules can carry either a ""flag"" that shines brightly in standard medical scanners or a bit of radiation to kill the targeted cancer cells. These molecules resemble natural components of cell membranes. Once injected intravenously, they are initially taken up throughout the body. Healthy cells break down these agents for elimination, but cancer cells lack that ability and therefore accumulate these molecules. This phenomenon was recognized in 1970 and preliminary studies were performed at the University of Michigan, where Jamey P. Weichert was a graduate student. He continued these studies when he joined the radiology faculty at UW-Madison in 1998. In 2003, Weichert created Cellectar, which employs 25 people, including six with doctorates from UW-Madison, at its office and lab in the southeast corner of Madison. Weichert, an associate professor, is Cellectar's chief scientific officer. Cellectar has altered the original molecule to produce a non-toxic agent that adheres tightly to cancer cells, but not to healthy cells. After years of testing in cancer cell lines and mice, Weichert and colleagues have demonstrated a phospholipid ether (PLE) compound that latches onto at least 60 types of cancer, producing a distinct signal that does not come from normal cells. In most normal tissues, says Weichert, ""there is almost no uptake. If you see a tumor, it shines like a light bulb."" One of the tags that can be joined to the engineered PLE shows up on PET scans. Another, which shines under near-infrared light, enables surgeons to easily see cancer cells during surgery. When bonded to a small dose of radioactive iodine, the PLE compound becomes a hunter-killer that can in theory deliver pinpoint radiation to cancer cells anywhere the body. The PLE also enters cancer stem cells, the seeds of resistant cancer cells that often cause a recurrence after treatment, says John Kuo, an associate professor of neurosurgery at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health. ""It was exciting to see that the cancer-selective property of the Cellectar agents also includes cancer stem cells. That's an important part of not missing cancer cells and achieving long-term cancer control."" The idea of easily and quickly identifying and treating cancer cells sounds too good to be true, concedes Kuo, who was initially ""quite skeptical. So many experimental treatments don't work in humans or may work against specific cancers or with specific mutations, but are still not effective against cancer stem cells."" After years of experimenting with PLE in animal models of brain cancer, Kuo is leading a nationwide phase 2 trial to test the timing and dosing of PLE for brain cancer. Weichert says Cellectar's compounds are involved in six other early-stage clinical trials. One will test the radioactive tag against multiple myeloma, a cancer of white blood cells. Cellectar agents recently received ""orphan drug"" status that allows smaller clinical trials and may lead to faster FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approval. In 12 years of existence, Cellectar has attracted $75 million in investments; in 2014 the company was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Despite the gathering momentum for PLE, obstacles remain. Curing cancer in mice is not the same as curing it in people. And cancer is a wily foe known for its ability to escape whatever is thrown at it. Yet even if PLE's cancer-killing potential does not live up to its billing, the ability to tag individual cancer cells may make it easier for surgeons to detect and remove cancer with even more precision. ""This is on the cusp of being able help surgeons and patients,"" says Weichert. ""Our job was to make the compounds and turn them over to our clinical colleagues at UW-Madison and elsewhere for testing. We think they will work, but their job is to prove it one way or the other in humans."" University of Wisconsin-Madison   Original reporting by: David Tenenbaum","Published: March 30, 2015"

Relationships between the brain and family income were strongest in the lowest end of the economic range -- suggesting that interventional policies aimed at these children may have the largest societal impact. The study, led by researchers at The Saban Research Institute of Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) and Columbia University Medical Center, will be published in the early online edition of the journal Nature Neuroscience. ""While in no way implying that a child's socioeconomic circumstances lead to immutable changes in brain development or cognition, our data suggest that wider access to resources likely afforded by the more affluent may lead to differences in a child's brain structure,"" said Elizabeth Sowell, PhD, director of the Developmental Cognitive Neuroimaging Laboratory, part of the Institute for the Developing Mind at CHLA. Sowell is also professor of Pediatrics at Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. In the largest study of its kind to date, the researchers looked at 1,099 typically developing individuals between the ages of 3 and 20 years, part of the multi-site Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition and Genetics (PING) study. Associations between socioeconomic factors (including parent education and family income) and measurements of surface area of the brain were drawn from demographic and developmental history questionnaires, as well as high-resolution brain MRIs. Statistics -- controlled for education, age and genetic ancestry -- showed that income was nonlinearly associated with brain surface area, and that income was more strongly associated with the brain than was parental educational attainment. ""Specifically, among children from the lowest-income families, small differences in income were associated with relatively large differences in surface area in a number of regions of the brain associated with skills important for academic success, "" said first author Kimberly G. Noble, MD, PhD, assistant professor of pediatrics and director of the Neurocognition, Early Experience and Development (NEED) Lab of Columbia University Medical Center. Noble is also an associate professor of Neuroscience and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University. Conversely, among children from higher-income families, incremental increases in income level were associated with much smaller differences in surface area. Higher income was also associated with better performance in certain cognitive skills -- cognitive differences that could be accounted for, in part, by greater brain surface area. ""Family income is linked to factors such as nutrition, health care, schools, play areas and, sometimes, air quality,"" said Sowell, adding that everything going on in the environment shapes the developing brain. ""Future research may address the question of whether changing a child's environment -- for instance, through social policies aimed at reducing family poverty -- could change the trajectory of brain development and cognition for the better.""

Using a new high-speed, high-resolution imaging method, Lihong Wang, PhD, and his team at Washington University in St. Louis were able to see blood flow, blood oxygenation, oxygen metabolism and other functions inside a living mouse brain at faster rates than ever before. Using photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), a single-wavelength, pulse-width-based technique developed in his lab, Wang, the Gene K. Beare Professor of Biomedical Engineering in the School of Engineering & Applied Science, was able to take images of blood oxygenation 50 times faster than their previous results using fast-scanning PAM; 100 times faster than their acoustic-resolution system; and more than 500 times faster than phosphorescence-lifetime-based two-photon microscopy (TPM). The results are published in Nature Methods advanced online publication. Other existing methods, including functional MRI (fMRI), TPM and wide-field optical microscopy, have provided information about the structure, blood oxygenation and flow dynamics of the mouse brain. However, those methods have speed and resolution limits, Wang says. To make up for these limitations, Wang and his lab implemented fast-functional PAM, which allowed them to get high-resolution, high-speed images of a living mouse brain through an intact skull. This method achieved a lateral spatial resolution of five times finer than the lab's previous fast-scanning system; 25 times finer than its previous acoustic-resolution system; and more than 35 times finer than ultrasound-array-based photoacoustic computed tomography. Most importantly, PAM allowed 3-D blood oxygenation imaging with capillary-level resolution at a one-dimensional imaging rate of 100 kHz, or 10 microseconds. ""Using this new single-wavelength, pulse-width-based method, PAM is capable of high-speed imaging of the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin,"" Wang said. ""In addition, we were able to map the mouse brain oxygenation vessel by vessel using this method."" ""Much of what we have learned about human brain function in the past decade has been based on observing changes in blood flow using functional MRI,"" said Richard Conroy, PhD, program director for Optical Imaging at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering. ""Wang's work dramatically increases both the spatial and temporal resolution of photoacoustic imaging, which now has the potential to reveal blood flow dynamics and oxygen metabolism at the level of individual cells. In the future, photoacoustic imaging could serve as an important complement to fMRI, leading to critical insights into brain function and disease development."" Concerned about the effects of the microscopy method on the living tissue, Wang and his team found that all red blood cells that were imaged were intact, and there was no damage to brain tissue. ""PAM is exquisitely sensitive to hemoglobin in the blood and to its color change due to oxygen binding,"" Wang said. ""Without injecting any exogenous contrast agent, PAM allows us to quantify vessel by vessel all of the vital parameters about hemoglobin and to even compute the metabolic rate of oxygen. Given the importance of oxygen metabolism in basic biology and diseases such as diabetes and cancer, PAM is expected to find broad applications.""

In a study to be published online in the journal Nature, the NYU Langone neuroscientists tracked neuronal activity in dendritic nerve branches as the mice learned motor tasks such as how to run forward and backward on a small treadmill. They concluded that the generation of calcium ion spikes -- which appeared in screen images as tiny ""lightning bolts"" in these dendrites -- was tied to the strengthening or weakening of connections between neurons, hallmarks of learning new information. ""We believe our study provides important insights into how the brain deals with vast amounts of information continuously as the brain learns new tasks,"" says senior study investigator and neuroscientist Wen-Biao Gan, PhD. Gan, a professor at NYU Langone and its Skirball Institute for Biomolecular Medicine, says, ""we have long wondered how the brain can store new information continuously throughout life without disrupting previously acquired memories. We now know that the generation of calcium spikes in separate branches of nerve cells is critical for the brain to encode and store large quantities of information without interfering with each other."" Lead study investigator Joseph Cichon, a neuroscience doctoral candidate at NYU Langone, says their discoveries could have important implications for explaining the underlying neural circuit problems in disorders like autism and schizophrenia. Cichon says the team's next steps are to see if calcium ion spikes are malfunctioning in animal models of these brain disorders. Among the study's key findings was that learning motor tasks such as running forward and backward induced completely separate patterns of lightning bolt-like activity in the dendrites of brain cells. These lightning bolts triggered a chain-like reaction, which changed the strength of connections between neurons. The study also identified a unique cell type in the brain that controlled where the lightning bolts were generated. When these cells were turned off, lightning bolt patterns in the brain were disrupted, and as a result, the animal lost the information it had just learned.

Researchers from the Niels Bohr Institute (NBI) have just developed a method that could be used to obtain extremely precise measurements of ultra-small magnetic fields. The results are published in Nature Physics. The tiny magnetic fields are all the way down on the atomic level. The atoms do not stand still, they revolve around themselves and the axis is like a tiny magnetic rod. But the axis has a slight tilt and as a result the magnetic rod swings in circles. To measure a swinging object you need to have both its position and the speed of the oscillation. But in the world of atoms, the laws of classical physics from the world as we know it do not apply - here the laws of quantum physics rule. Heisenberg and Bohr's laws of quantum uncertainty relations state that when one measures a system, you cannot simultaneously measure the position of a particle and its speed and get a precise number. You can measure one of these variables, for example, the position and get a number with almost unlimited precision. In the same measurement, the speed of the particle would then be uncertain. If you measure the precise speed of the particle, you would then get an uncertain position in the same measurement. Likewise, the laws of quantum physics state then when you measure a rotating motion, you cannot simultaneously measure the rotational speed and direction of the rotational axis. ""To get accurate measurements of ultra-small magnetic fields, we have devised a way to almost escape the limitations of quantum physics and we have conducted experiments in the laboratory where we improve the measurements of the oscillating atoms. The newly developed sensor that can measure the ultra-small magnetic field is comprised of a collection of atoms in gaseous form,"" explains professor Eugene Polzik, head of the research group Quantop at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen. In the quantum optics laboratory, the researchers have a small glass tube that contains a cloud of billions of caesium gas atoms. The glass tube is 10 millimeters long and has a diameter of only 300 micrometers (a micrometer is one millionth of a meter). The atoms revolve around themselves on a tilted axis, but the gas atoms are flying around helter skelter and the tilted axes of the atoms are oriented in all possible directions. Using laser light, the tilts of all the atoms are turned in the same direction. This direction could be knocked off course when the atoms crash into the glass wall, but the glass tube has an inner coating that ensures they hold course. Now the researchers send a new beam of laser light with a different frequency into the gas atoms and then a strange quantum phenomenon takes place, the light and the gas atoms become entangled. The fact that they are entangled means that they have established a quantum link - they are synchronised and are now totally aligned. The laser light is sent with a certain pulse and you can now measure the direction of the atomic axis, but only one direction. This means that when the atoms revolve around themselves, its tilted axis forms a circle and you cannot measure the precise position of the entire circular swing of the axis. But you can divide a circle into a north/south direction and an east/west direction. ""What we then do is measure one of the directions, for example, the east/west direction. This is called a squeezed state and this can be measured with very little inaccuracy. This is very useful, because for many measurements of external magnetic fields it is only necessary to measure the east/west direction and thus we can calculate the ultra-small magnetic fields with high precision,"" says Eugene Polzik. Super sensitive measurements of tiny electromagnetic fields and forces are important in relation to research in biology and medicine and the research group therefore has a collaboration with the doctors at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen.

The study, published in Nature Immunology, offers new insight into the link between neurodegenerative disorders and inflammation, and provides a framework to explore more fully the possibility that viral infection may lead to onset of these diseases. Matthew Miller, an investigator at the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Diseases Research, is the study's lead author. He said mutations in the senataxin gene (SETX) are known to cause certain types of neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 4 (ALS4 -- a type of Lou Gehrig's Disease) and ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2). However, no one currently understands why these mutations result in neurodegenerative diseases. ""We have found that senataxin deficiency, and cells from individuals with these neurodegenerative diseases, respond abnormally to viral infections,"" said Miller. ""Specifically, they generate abnormally high amounts of inflammation, which is known to play an important role in several neurological diseases. Our study identifies abnormal inflammation as a potential contributing factor in ALS, which opens the door to explore new therapeutic options."" The scientists studied senataxin, a protein implicated in a juvenile-onset form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in ataxia with oculomotor apraxia. ALS, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rare neurodegenerative condition that affects motor neurons and causes progressive muscle wasting and movement problems. Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia is a rare disorder with an average onset age of 15 that causes muscle control problems and loss of peripheral vision. The scientists used gene expression studies as well as in-depth chromatin analysis to uncover the regulatory role of the protein. While most previous work to characterize the protein has been conducted in yeast cells, this project gained new information by analyzing human cells as well. The team found that senataxin has far more power to regulate gene activity than was previously known. Using cutting-edge genomic tools, the researchers found that senataxin is deployed to regulate the body's natural antiviral response at a specific point. Without it, exposure to viral pathogens can lead to inflammation and potentially to life-threatening conditions. People with senataxin-related forms of ALS and ataxia have a defective SETX gene that leads to a dysfunctional form of the protein. ""This is the first protein implicated in neurodegenerative disease that has been linked to our innate antiviral mechanism, and it offers an intriguing clue to the inflammatory response associated with these diseases,"" said Ivan Marazzi, co-author of the paper and an assistant professor in the Department of Microbiology at Mount Sinai.

Researchers have discovered an unconventional way that serotonin is released from neurons that could play an important role in the mechanism through which antidepressant drugs work. The Journal of General Physiology study is highlighted in the April issue. Serotonin is a chemical in the brain that plays a key role in regulating various emotions and behaviors. Like other neurotransmitters, which relay signals between neurons, serotonin is stored in vesicles in the presynaptic terminal of one neuron and released into the synapse in response to neuronal firing to bind to receptors on a postsynaptic neuron. An imbalance in serotonin signaling is generally thought to contribute to depression. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of antidepressants that increase levels of extracellular serotonin by preventing its reuptake by neurons. However, one of the main drawbacks of SSRIs is their delayed effect. A contributing factor to the delay is thought to be that the firing of serotonergic neurons is itself suppressed by extracellular serotonin, which acts on inhibitory neuronal ""autoreceptors"" in a process known as autoinhibition. Thus, SSRIs -- which are intended to enhance serotonin signaling -- may actually initially slow the therapeutic process. Now, Boris Mlinar and colleagues from the University of Florence show that, remarkably, the serotonin that mediates autoinhibition appears to be released into the extracellular space through a distinct process. Rather than being released from vesicles in response to neuronal firing (in a process known as exocytosis), the study indicates that this pool of serotonin may be supplied by simple diffusion across the cell membrane. Mlinar and colleagues believe that a full understanding of this process might inform better strategies of modulating serotonin signaling in order to treat depression.

""Our results indicate that different sets of genes are used in immune responses to viruses versus other pathogens, and these anti-viral genes are regulated by two very distinct processes -- expression and DNA methylation,"" said David Galbraith, graduate student in entomology, Penn State. The results appear in the Mar. 26 issue of PLOS Pathogens. According to Christina Grozinger, director of the Penn State Center for Pollinator Research, beekeepers lose an average of 30 percent of their colonies every winter and an average of 25 percent in the summer. ""Honey bees have more than 20 types of viruses, and several of them have been linked to losses of honey bee colonies,"" she said. ""Yet, beekeepers currently do not have any commercially available methods to reduce viral infections."" With a goal of uncovering which genes increase or decrease their activity in response to the presence of viruses, the researchers measured expression levels of all genes in the honey bee genome in both infected and uninfected bees. They found that the RNAi pathway had increased activity and, therefore, is likely an important anti-viral immune pathway in bees. ""Previous studies suggested the RNAi pathway was involved in anti-viral immune responses in bees, but we showed that expression levels of many genes in this pathway are significantly higher in virus-infected bees,"" said Grozinger. ""The RNAi pathway helps to cut up and destroy viral RNA so it is not infectious."" Scientists and beekeepers are increasingly interested in using RNAi approaches to control viruses and parasites in agricultural crops and in honey bee colonies, according to Grozinger. ""We will need to make sure that any artificial RNAi approaches do not interfere with the natural anti-viral RNAi mechanisms in honey bees,"" Grozinger said. In addition to examining gene expression in virus-infected versus uninfected honey bees, the researchers also scanned the honey bee DNA for extra methylation marks that may have been added or removed from genes in virus-infected bees. The team found that viral infections do change the pattern of DNA methylation in honey bees, and in a completely different set of genes from the ones in the RNAi pathway. Many of these differentially methylated genes are also involved in anti-viral responses in mammals, but they have not previously been linked to anti-viral responses in insects, said Grozinger. ""We found that there was very little overlap between differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes, suggesting dual genomic response pathways to viral infection,"" said Galbraith. ""For the first time, we characterized both the global gene expression and DNA methylation patterns associated with acute viral infection in honey bees. We confirmed that the RNAi pathway, which has been seen in other insects, is also an antiviral defense mechanism in honey bees. And, for the first time, we observed alterations in DNA methylation patterns in response to viral infection in honey bees.""

But not all lettuce varieties have the same antioxidant effect. According to a study led by the researcher Usue P rez-L pez of the Department of Plant Biology and Ecology of the UPV/EHU's Faculty of Science and Technology, the colour of the leaves of these vegetables determines the speed at which their compounds act. So lettuces with green leaves have antioxidants that react more slowly while red-leaf ones have a faster effect. The results of this study have been set out in a paper ""Phenolic Composition and Related Antioxidant Properties in Differently Coloured Lettuces: A Study by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Kinetics"" recently published by the  Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry'. Antioxidants provide long-term protection against the chain reactions of free radical processes, in other words, of the molecules that are capable of causing cell damage and generating various diseases. Free radicals harm our body by causing, in the best of cases, ageing and, in the worse, serious diseases. Lettuce is rich in antioxidants, as it contains compounds like phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and vitamins A and C, among other things. Green, semi-red and red leaves To conduct this research, which started in 2011 and in which researchers of the UPV/EHU and the University of Pisa (Italy) have been participating, the compounds of three lettuce varieties were analysed: the green-leaf  Batavia', the semi-red-leaf  Marvel of Four Seasons', and the red-leaf  Oak Leaf'. Using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) techniques, they were able to observe the behaviour of the kinetics of the compounds of each variety. And the results show that the green-leaf lettuce contains water-soluble, antioxidant compounds that act at a slow and intermediate speed, the red-leaf one has compounds with intermediate and rapid kinetics, and the semi-red-leaf one has three kinds of compounds, with a rapid, intermediate and slow speed. As Dr P rez-L pez stressed, ""the fact that there are compounds that act at different speeds does not mean that some are better or worse than others. If we eat foods that can generate free-radical activity, there will be some compounds that act to eliminate them more quickly. But at the same time, it is also important that our bodies should acquire foods with antioxidants that have slower kinetics so that the latter will continue to act over a longer period of time. That is why people say that it is very interesting to mix different types of lettuce because they have different, complementary characteristics"". Boosting the properties Having determined the kinetics of the antioxidants, the research is currently continuing with the aim of achieving a nutraceutical improvement of these three varieties of lettuce. The research group is now trying to boost the effect of the specific compounds in each variety by subjecting the plants to short stresses. These compounds perform defence functions in plants. So if conditions that are not the normal ones are applied to them (such as watering them with salinated water, subjecting them to high lighting intensity or working with raised concentrations of CO2), these defences will become intensified and, as a result, the antioxidant qualities of the plants will be boosted. ""What matters in this process is not to lose productivity, and that is why we apply short-intensity stresses. With excessive stress, we could reach a point in which plant growth is reduced, and we are not interested in achieving greater quality at the cost of a reduction in size. The aim is to maintain production and achieve greater quality in this production,"" pointed out Dr Usue P rez-L pez.","Published: March 30, 2015"

A small number of children who catch the influenza virus fall so ill they end up in the hospital   perhaps needing ventilators to breathe   even while their family and friends recover easily. New research by Rockefeller University scientists, published March 26 in Science, helps explain why: a rare genetic mutation. The researchers scrutinized blood and tissue samples from a young girl who, at the age of two-and-a-half, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome after catching the flu, and ended up fighting for her life in the hospital. Years after her ordeal, which she survived, scientists led by Jean-Laurent Casanova discovered that it could be explained by a rare mutation she carries that prevented her from producing a protein, interferon, that helps fight off the virus.  This is the first example of a common, isolated and life-threatening infection of childhood that is shown to be also a genetic disease,  says Casanova. The good news from these results, however, is that clinicians have a new treatment option for children who mysteriously develop severe cases of the flu.  This finding suggests that one could treat severe flu of childhood with interferon, which is commercially available,  says Casanova, who is professor and head of the St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Disease at Rockefeller, as well as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. The fact that a child s genes could affect the severity of her illness wasn t a surprise to the members of Casanova s lab, who have been studying this phenomenon for decades. For instance, they have discovered genetic differences that help explain why the herpes simplex virus   which causes innocuous cold sores in most people   can, in rare cases, lead to potentially fatal infections that spread to the brain. Turning their attention to influenza, Michael J. Ciancanelli, a research associate and senior member of Casanova s lab, and his colleagues sequenced all genes in the genomes of the young girl who survived her dangerous bout of the flu and her parents, looking for mutations that might explain her vulnerability. Knowing how rare her reaction to the flu was, they narrowed their search to mutations that were unique to her, then focused only on those that affected the immune system. What emerged from their work was the finding that the girl had inherited two differently mutated copies of the gene IRF7, which encodes a protein that amplifies the production of interferon, a critical part of the body s response to viral infections.  No other mutations could have explained her reaction to the influenza virus,  says Ciancanelli.  Each mutation is very uncommon and thus the likelihood of carrying two damaged copies of the gene is extremely rare.  Indeed, when they infected a sample of her blood cells that normally produce interferon  plasmacytoid dendritic cells   the researchers measured no interferon. In contrast, blood cells from her parents, who each carried only one mutated version of the gene, produced healthy amounts of interferon when exposed to influenza.  That really was definitive proof that a single, non-mutated copy of this gene is enough to allow people to mount a response to the virus,  says Ciancanelli. The researchers also employed a cutting-edge technology developed by their collaborators at Columbia University to reprogram the child s skin cells into early progenitor cells, then differentiate those into lung cells, the front lines of influenza infections. Not surprisingly, the virus replicated more in the patient s cells than in the same cells from healthy people. Although the patient remains susceptible to severe reactions to new influenza viruses, annual vaccination against seasonal flu has, so far, prevented the occurrence of severe symptoms, indiciating that IRF7 is not needed for adaptive immunity to secondary infection by a flu virus. Moreover, she hasn t fallen nearly as ill from other viruses, suggesting her lack of IRF7-dependent interferon production may not leave her vulnerable to viruses overall   a situation the researchers say they have also noted with other mutations that underlie infectious disease.","Published: March 30, 2015"

Are its senses affected? Its behavior? Can it even survive? Thanks to the recent advance of gene editing technology, this gold standard genetic experiment has become much more accessible in a wide variety of organisms. Now, researchers at Rockefeller University have harnessed a technique known as CRISPR-Cas9 editing in an important and understudied species: the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, which infects hundreds of millions of people annually with the deadly diseases chikungunya, yellow fever, and dengue fever. Researchers led by postdoctoral fellow Benjamin J. Matthews adapted the CRISPR-Cas9 system to Ae. aegypti and were able to efficiently generate targeted mutations and insertions in a number of genes. The immediate goal of this project, says Matthews, is to learn more about how different genes help the species operate so efficiently as a disease vector, and create new ways to control it.  To understand how the female mosquito actually transmits disease,  says Matthews,  you have to learn how she finds humans to bite, and how she chooses a source of water to lay her eggs. Once you have that information, techniques for intervention will come.  In the study, published March 26 in Cell Reports, Matthews and research assistant Kathryn E. Kistler, both in Leslie B. Vosshall s Laboratory of Neurogenetics and Behavior, adapted the CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce precise mutations in Ae. aegypti. Previously, to create these types of mutations, scientists relied on techniques that used engineered proteins to bind to specific segments of DNA they wanted to remove, a process that was both expensive and unreliable. CRISPR-Cas9, in contrast, consists of short stretches of RNA that bind to specific regions of the genome where a protein, Cas9, cleaves the DNA. Scientists have been studying how RNA binds to DNA for decades and  the targeting is done with rules that we have a good handle on,  says Matthews, which makes it easy to reprogram CRISPR-Cas9 to target any gene.  This amazing technique has worked in nearly every organism that s been tried,  says Vosshall, who is Robin Chemers Neustein Professor and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.  There are lots of interesting animal species out there that could not be studied using genetics prior to CRISPR-Cas9, and as a result this technique is already revolutionizing biology.  This work opens the door to learning more about the role of specific genes the Vosshall lab suspects may help mosquitoes propagate, perhaps by finding the perfect spot to lay their eggs. Their protocols will likely also help other scientists apply the same technique to study additional organisms, such as agricultural pests or mosquitoes that carry malaria.  Before starting this project, we thought it would be difficult to modify many genes in the mosquito genome in a lab setting  Matthews says.  With a little tweaking, we were able to make this technique routine and it s only going to get easier, faster, and cheaper from here on out. ","Published: March 30, 2015"

This helps explain why survival prospects for women with the diagnosis tend to be either very good or very bad. The Sydney-based research team has found a gene that drives the aggressive disease, and hopes to find a way to  switch it off . The aggressive form of triple-negative breast cancer appears to arise from stem cells, while the more benign form appears to arise from specialised cells.  Stem cells have many of the same features as cancers. They are plastic and flexible, and have the ability to proliferate and spread into other tissues   deadly traits in cancers. Previous studies have shown that breast stem cells are needed for breast growth and development during puberty and pregnancy, although how they evolve from stem cells into specialist cells has been unclear.  The new study has shown that a gene known as  inhibitor of differentiation 4  (ID4) determines whether a stem cell remains a stem cell, or whether it differentiates into a specialist cell.  Notably, when the high levels of ID4 in a stem cell are  switched off , other genes that drive cell specialisation are  switched on . Drs Alex Swarbrick and Simon Junankar from Sydney s Garvan Institute of Medical Research spearheaded this large interdisciplinary study, which links the development of the mammary gland in mice with human breast cancer. Its main finding, that ID4 not only  marks , but appears to control, the highly aggressive form of triple negative breast cancer is published online today in Nature Communications.  We found that ID4 is produced at high levels in roughly half of all triple negative breast cancers, and that these cancers have a particularly poor prognosis,  said project leader Dr Alex Swarbrick.  We also showed that if you block the ID4 gene in experimental models of triple negative breast cancer, the tumour cells stop dividing.  It is interesting to note that blocking ID4 switches on the oestrogen receptor and several other genes expressed by the best-prognosis breast cancer.  Oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancers have a relatively good prognosis because the drug Tamoxifen is very effective at blocking the oestrogen receptor and hence their growth  noted Swarbrick.  We speculate, therefore, that by blocking ID4 it might be possible to turn stem-cell-like breast cancers into less aggressive breast cancers that may even respond to tamoxifen. If we are correct, that would be remarkable.  The next step for Dr Swarbrick and his team will be to study the biochemistry of ID4 in a cell   to determine how best to block it in people.  There are also plans to undertake therapeutic experiments in mice to test whether or not switching off ID4 sensitises a tumour to tamoxifen.  We don t know yet whether we are seeing a real oestrogen-dependent cancer after ID4 is blocked   one with an effective oestrogen receptor   or just a caricature of one.  We re very fortunate that our collaborator in Cambridge UK is a world expert on oestrogen receptor function.   We also have technologies that allow us to study processes on a genome-wide scale   so we can map the interactions of ID4 comprehensively. ","Published: March 30, 2015"

The company has entered into a major multiyear alliance with Aduro Biotech that is focused on the discovery and development of next generation cancer immunotherapies targeting the STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) pathway and launched a new immuno-oncology research group led by renowned cancer vaccine expert Glenn Dranoff, MD.   The addition of STING agonists adds firepower to Novartis' diverse portfolio of immunotherapies that includes chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) technology and novel checkpoint inhibitors. Currently the CART program, CTL019, is in phase 2 clinical trials and checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD1, LAG3, and TIM3 are expected to enter the clinic in mid-2015. STING is a signaling pathway that when activated is known to initiate broad innate and adaptive immune responses in tumors. Aduro's novel small molecule cyclic dinucleotides (CDN's) have proven to generate an immune response in preclinical models that specifically attacks tumor cells.  ""Immunotherapy is one of the exciting frontiers in oncology today. Current approaches with checkpoint inhibitors and T-cell modulation are potent but only in select tumor types. STING agonists have the potential to fully activate the immune system to attack a broader range of tumors,"" said Mark Fishman, President of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. ""Under Glenn Dranoff's leadership our new immuno-oncology research group will aggressively drive our current programs to the clinic and explore new directions for both mono and combination therapies."" Under the terms of the agreement with Aduro, Novartis will make an upfront payment of $200 million to Aduro and will make an initial equity investment in the company for $25 million, with a commitment for another $25 million equity investment at a future date. Aduro will lead commercialization activities and book sales in the US, with Novartis leading commercialization and recognizing sales in the rest of the world.

The Australian researchers have shown that graphene- a one-atom thick sheet of hexagonally arranged carbon, shaped like chicken wire - can detect the four nucleobases that make up DNA (cytosine, guanine, adenine and thymine). A unique combination of the four nucleobases makes up the individual DNA sequence of a gene. Currently, DNA sequencing is a fundamental tool for medical diagnostics, forensic testing and medical and biological research. The use of graphene to electrically sequence DNA promises to improve the speed, throughput, reliability and accuracy whilst reducing the price compared to current techniques said Nikolai Dontschuk from the University of Melbourne.  We found that each nucleobase influenced the electronic structure of graphene in a measurably different way,  said Mr Dontschuk.  When used in conjunction with a nanopore (a tiny hole), a single DNA molecule would pass through the graphene-based electrical sensor - like a single string of beads passing through one section of tiny chicken wire- enabling real-time, high-throughput sequencing of a single DNA molecule.  The research team conducted the first experiments to combine in situ electrical measurements of graphene-based field effect transistors (GFET) with photoemission spectroscopy at the soft x-ray spectroscopy beamline at the Synchrotron. After comparing the experimental and synchrotron results, the team predicted that single-molecule sensing of guanine, cytosine and thymine by bulk graphene devices could be achieved.","Published: March 30, 2015"

To the company s knowledge, this is the first time that a genetically engineered Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) treatment has successfully completed a Phase I clinical trial and been approved to initiate a Phase II trial. The first patient in the Phase II trial has already been treated. apceth s proprietary Agenmestencel-T next-generation MSC therapy is based on cells harvested from the patient's own (autologous) bone marrow, which are processed, genetically modified, and re-infused into the patient. The cells specifically target tumors or metastases, and, upon reaching the target tissue, the cytotoxic gene product is selectively activated, increasing local efficacy with reduced systemic toxicity.  apceth is pioneering a transformative approach to cell-based therapies and we see this trial start as an important validation of both the safety and therapeutic potential of our technology,  said Dr. Christine G nther, Chief Executive Officer of apceth.  apceth s progress to date supports our larger objective of expressing any therapeutic gene directly in tumors, with future applications planned for other indications including lung diseases and inflammation. We also expect to initiate a Phase I/II trial for the allogeneic off-the-shelf version of Agenmestencel-T (Agenmestencel-L) in Q4 2015.  apceth has initiated the Phase II part of the trial using the high-dose treatment regime as evaluated in the Phase I trial. The open label study will include ten advanced gastrointestinal cancer patients and will evaluate the safety and tolerability of Agenmestencel-T and its efficacy based on RECIST criteria, with the aim to establish proof of concept of this novel technology in late-stage cancer patients. In parallel, six patients will be treated prior to tumor resection surgery, without subsequent ganciclovir administration, and tumor biopsies will be analyzed for presence of the genetically modified MSCs. The completed Phase I trial included six patients suffering from advanced-stage gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (3 colorectal, 2 pancreatic, and 1 cholangiocellular carcinoma).

All safety and efficacy endpoints were met, showing that treatment with BL-8040 as a single agent was safe and well tolerated at all doses and resulted in efficient stem cell mobilization and collection in all study participants. Importantly, the results support BL-8040 as one-day, single-dose collection regimen, which is a significant improvement upon the current standard of care. Robust stem cell mobilization was evident in all treated participants, across the different doses tested, supporting a novel approach to stem cell collection. After a single administration, BL-8040 enabled collection of a yield of stem cells that exceeds the number required to support a transplant in all treated participants, following only one collection procedure. The Company intends to present the full set of study results at the European Hematology Association (EHA) Conference taking place in Vienna in June 2015. Dr. John DiPersio, Chief of the Division of Oncology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, stated,  I am very impressed and encouraged by the activity of BL-8040 in promoting stem cell mobilization and collection as a single agent. The robust effect seen in all participants substantially differentiates this compound from the currently approved mobilization regimens, which require four to five days of treatment and one to three full-day apheresis sessions, and can be associated with side effects including bone pain. Therefore, a novel agent with the capacity to rapidly mobilize substantial amounts of stem cells, while providing a shorter and better tolerated drug administration and cell collection regimen, will be of great value both medically and in terms of patient comfort.   We are very enthusiastic about the study results showing the outstanding activity of BL-8040 in promoting stem cell mobilization. The results exceeded our expectations, and validate BL-8040 as a highly differentiated stand-alone treatment for stem-cell collection. We plan to meet with the FDA as soon as practicable, in order to discuss the results of this study and obtain more clarity on the next steps in the clinical development program for this indication,  commented Dr. Kinneret Savitsky, CEO of BioLineRx.  In addition to stem-cell mobilization, our BL-8040 platform is also undergoing a Phase 2 study for treating relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia patients, results of which are expected in the second half of 2015. In addition, as recently reported, we expect to commence clinical trials for three additional indications for BL-8040 in the second quarter of 2015.  The Phase 1 safety and efficacy study consisted of two parts. The first part was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study exploring the safety and tolerability of escalating repeated doses of BL-8040 in three cohorts of eight healthy volunteers. Based on data from the first part, an optimal safe and efficacious dose of BL-8040 was selected, which was used as a stand-alone therapy in a single cohort of eight healthy volunteers in the second open-label part of the study. This part of the study was designed to assess BL-8040 s stem cell mobilization capacity, as well as the yield of cells collected by apheresis. Secondary efficacy endpoints of the study included the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of the drug, as well as an evaluation of the viability and biological activity of cells mobilized by BL-8040 and collected by apheresis.","Published: March 28, 2015"

Failure of CD4+ T cells, a major target of HIV, to rebound after the virus has been suppressed with medication occurs in about 15 percent of adult patients and is associated with serious, life-threatening illnesses. The researchers conducted the current study to find out to what extent children who were infected with HIV around the time of birth might be at risk for this condition and whether this failure carried with it a major risk for serious infection.  The good news is that this condition occurs only infrequently in young children with HIV,  said study author Rohan Hazra, chief of the Maternal and Pediatric Infectious Disease Branch at NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which provided much of the funding for the study.  The comparatively few children whose CD4+ cells failed to rebound did not appear to be at any greater risk for serious infection than children with higher CD4+ counts.  He added that the findings do not appear to change treatment recommendations for children with HIV, which include antiretroviral drugs to suppress the virus and periodic follow-up examinations to detect the first signs of any serious infections. The findings were published online in AIDS, and the study was conducted by a team of researchers at several institutions in the United States and Brazil. The study s first author was Paul Krogstad of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. To conduct their analysis, the researchers reviewed data from three research networks caring for more than 3,700 children in the U.S., Central and South America, and the Caribbean who were infected with HIV before or during birth. The researchers followed the CD4+ cell counts of 933 children who were at least 5 years old when they started anti-HIV treatment. Healthy CD4+ cell counts range from 500-1,200 cells per blood sample. Fewer than 500 cells per sample is considered low, and 200 or fewer per sample is considered very low. After one year of anti-HIV treatment, 86 percent of children in the study achieved CD4+ counts of 500 or more. After two years of anti-HIV treatment, 92 percent surpassed this threshold. The researchers also reviewed the children s records for signs of serious illness during the course of their treatment. Known as CDC Category C events, these illnesses are a sign of the seriously weakened immune system seen in people with AIDS. A total of nine children experienced such events. The occurrence of these events did not differ statistically between those having CD4+ cell counts below 500 at the time of the event (four children) and those with counts above 500 (five children). The study authors noted that compared to adults with low CD4+ counts at the beginning of treatment, CD4+ counts in children increase to 500 or more with time after treatment has begun. Yet, despite such increases, some children had Category C conditions or other significant illnesses during the first three years of HIV treatment. The researchers called for additional studies to understand this higher risk of illness.","Published: March 28, 2015"

The Trust, based at St George s Hospital in South West London, will be the first NHS facility to offer an in-house NIPT screening for pregnant women in the UK. The project award is a three-year contract with options to extend annually. Non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) is an advanced screening test for pregnant women, using a small blood sample rather than an invasive procedure such as an amniocentisis, the test estimates the risk of a fetus having Down s syndrome or other serious genetic diseases. Until now, pregnant women in the UK could only access NIPT privately, with blood samples being sent to the US or China. Not only was this costly but carried a waiting time of up to two weeks which is a long time when parents may need to make decisions about their pregnancies. The IONA  test is the first CE-marked in vitro diagnostic (IVD) product for NIPT. It uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to estimate the risk of a fetus having serious genetic disorders such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), Edward syndrome (Trisomy 18) and Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13) by analyzing cell-free fetal DNA from a sample of maternal blood. Working in partnership, Premaitha and the Trust intend to establish St George s NIPT service as a UK Centre of Excellence for Prenatal Screening enabling the Trust to offer this test to pregnant women through the NHS and also privately. This will provide accurate and reliable results in a matter of days, allowing pregnant women and their families to receive the information they need to make informed decisions in a much faster timeframe, reducing anxiety as much as possible. Professor Basky Thilaganathan, Consultant Obstetrician at St George s commented,  This is great news for the trust and for pregnant women in the UK. NIPT has the potential to make a huge difference to the care and reassurance that clinicians can offer to pregnant women. Too many have been through the anxiety and discomfort of invasive procedures after receiving false positive results from the combined test - the IONA  test gives us the accuracy and reliability to reduce this number significantly. We are very happy to be able to partner with a UK innovator like Premaitha to create an UK Centre of Excellence using the first regulated NIPT test.  Dr Stephen Little, CEO of Premaitha added:  This award by St George s is a strong endorsement of the robustness, reliability and accuracy of the IONA  test and we are pleased to be able to collaborate with the Trust to make the many benefits of NIPT a reality for pregnant women and clinicians within the UK. We recognized the limitations in the current standard of prenatal screening and the huge unmet medical need for a regulated test that centres such as St George s could provide in-house. We are working closely with the St George s team to get the IONA  test up and running as soon as possible.  NIPT has a higher detection rate and lower false positive rate than the current combined test offered to pregnant women in the UK.

The team from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge was headed by Dr Andrew Carter. He explains the significance of cellular transport:  A cell is like a country. Different elements are produced in different areas, and it needs a transport network to distribute these elements effectively. We have uncovered new insights into how this process actually works, and how it can potentially go wrong, leading to diseases like neurodegeneration and herpes.  One of the key parts of the cellular transport network is dynein, a protein complex that functions like a tiny motor, travelling long distances to transport different cargos around the cell. Dynein carries things like mitochondria, which provide energy to the cell, and mRNAs, which contain the information to make new proteins. Dynein is essential to the proper functioning of the cell; however things can sometimes go wrong. Part of dynein s role is to transport toxic elements called aggregated proteins away to be disposed of. Aggregated proteins are known to cause the death of nerve cells; which in turn leads to neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia and Parkinson s. We already know that when dynein goes wrong it can lead to neurodegeneration. Dynein is also at risk of being hijacked by certain viruses. Viruses in the herpes family, for example, attach themselves to dynein so that they can be transported to the nerve cell s nucleus where they lie dormant ready to be reactivated and cause outbreaks. For the first time, scientists have now observed exactly how dynein transports cargo around the cell. This research could prove instrumental to the prevention of scenarios leading to nerve cell death and infection. The group discovered that dynein works because another protein, known as a  cargo adaptor , attaches to it, causing it to bind with yet another protein: dynactin. This creates an intricate protein complex and sets off a reaction that causes dynein to move around the cell, transporting its cargo. This research opens up exciting possibilities for further study. The team suspects that the cargo adapter that binds to dynein varies depending on the cargo that is being carried - so there will be a different adaptor for mitochondria, for mRNA, and so on. The next step is for researchers to investigate other cargo adapters, to expand our understanding of the transport network. This is highly significant research; understanding exactly how the cellular transport network functions could allow us to intervene and prevent things from going wrong. This work could have future implications for the design of medical therapies for both neurological conditions and herpes. Dr Andrew Carter comments:  dynein and dynactin are really challenging to work with, but my team did an amazing job. We found it fascinating to discover how it works and look forward to future developments in understanding how it contributes to human diseases . The research was supported by the I03 beamline at Diamond, where the team determined the crystal structure of part of the protein complex at the heart of the transport mechanism. The team also used cryo-electron microscopy at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. Cryo-EM is an advanced technique that allows scientists to study biological process in intricate detail, and Diamond is currently building its own cryo-EM facility, which will be opening in late 2015. Diamond s Life Sciences Director, Dave Stuart comments:  Diamond is delighted to be home to this new facility and it is hoped that through this major advances in visualizing sub cellular mechanisms will be made.  The findings of the MRC team opens up many new possibilities for research into cellular transport networks and their role in disease. This work could be an early stage in discovering new ways of preventing things going wrong within the networks, thus leading to new therapies for some of nature s most hard to treat diseases.","Published: March 28, 2015"

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has previously granted an orphan drug designation pertaining to the EU. The orphan drug designations will significantly shorten future market approval processes and reinforce market exclusivity for a launched product in the U.S. and EU.  This positive decision from the FDA underpins the great need for products that can improve the outcome of glaucoma surgery. Clanotech is now preparing for a phase I/II trial with CLT-28643 , said Patrizia Caldirola, CEO, Clanotech. Clanotech s lead compound, an  5 1-integrin antagonist, has anti-angiogenic, anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties. Based on promising preclinical data in animal models for glaucoma, CLT-28643 has the potential to regulate wound healing processes following glaucoma surgery. Glaucoma patients refractory to medications that lower the intraocular pressure undergo surgical intervention that creates a flap in the eye to drain liquid and more effectively lower the pressure in the eye. Correct healing of the flap is critical for the long term success of the procedure. A cytotoxic antimetabolite is used to prevent closure of the flap, however, the treatment is associated with significant side effects. Clanotech s mission is to improve the outcome of glaucoma surgery by the development of CLT-28643 and thereby replace non-specific cytotoxic treatment with a target specific therapy that has an improved safety profile.","Published: March 28, 2015"

These findings radically modify the way that HBV vertical infection of neonates (mother-to-child) is portrayed, and present a paradigm shift in the approach to treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B. The research, published in Nature Communications on 25 March 2015, was led by Professor Antonio Bertoletti from the Emerging Infectious Diseases Program (EID) at Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School (Duke-NUS). Currently widespread in Asia, HBV affects approximately 300 million people worldwide while 6 in 100 Singaporeans are chronic carriers. The majority of HBV chronic infections in Asia are acquired at birth. While there is a safe and effective vaccine available, 5% to 10% of babies born to HBV positive mothers still contract the infection. Conventionally, HBV is thought to exploit the immaturity of the neonatal immune system to establish persistent infection. Current guidelines from international liver associations recommend treatment for HBV carriers only when they show clear signs of active liver disease, typically after the age of 30. This is based on the assumptions that HBV is considered harmless until symptoms of the disease emerge, and that young patients are immune-tolerant to HBV, meaning they have no protective response to the virus and are unable to react to treatment. Prof Bertoletti, in collaboration with the National University Hospital (Singapore) and Universitaria di Parma (Italy), showed that contrary to current belief, infants exposed to HBV are not immune-tolerant but they have more mature immune systems. The team examined the immune cells in the cord blood of mothers who were HBV positive and discovered that both the innate and adaptive immune cells are more activated and mature, and they respond better to bacteria challenge, a phenomenon called  trained immunity . These suggest that their immune cells may be more acclimatized to dealing with potential bacterial infections than the cells from cord blood of healthy mothers. First author, Duke-NUS Research Fellow Michelle Hong, is heartened about contributing to the understanding of a disease that is endemic in Asia.  Our work contributes to the understanding of how HBV exposure before birth shapes the global immune response of newborn infants and transforms the way we look at HBV. Despite causing diseases later in life, HBV might actually be beneficial to humans early in life.  Previously, Prof Bertoletti had shown that young adults (aged 14 to 30) with chronic HBV infection are not immune tolerant and possess immune cells able to counter the virus. Moving forward, he plans to examine the impact of HBV infection in paediatric patients; those aged two to 12, to determine how their immune system responds to the virus. The combined findings from these different studies are poised to shape the guidelines for chronic HBV treatment in patients - starting from young adults  or even earlier.

The rare genetic variant offers important insights into the root causes of autism, the researchers say. And, they suggest, their unconventional method can be used to identify other genetic causes of autism and other complex genetic conditions. A report on the study appears in the April 2 issue of the journal Nature. In recent years, falling costs for genetic testing, together with powerful new means of storing and analyzing massive amounts of data, have ushered in the era of the genome wide association and sequencing studies. These studies typically compare genetic sequencing data from thousands of people with and without a given disease to map the locations of genetic variants that contribute to the disease. While genome wide association studies have linked many genes to particular diseases, their results have so far failed to lead to predictive genetic tests for common conditions, such as Alzheimer s, autism or schizophrenia.  In genetics, we all believe that you have to sequence endlessly before you can find anything,  says Aravinda Chakravarti, Ph.D., a professor in the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine s McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine.  I think whom you sequence is as important - if not more so - than how many people are sequenced.  With that idea, Chakravarti and his collaborators identified families in which more than one female has autism spectrum disorder, a condition first described at Johns Hopkins in 1943. For reasons that are not understood, girls are far less likely than boys to have autism, but when girls do have the condition, their symptoms tend to be severe. Chakravarti reasoned that females with autism, particularly those with a close female relative who is also affected, must carry very potent genetic variants for the disease, and he wanted to find out what those were. The research team compared the gene sequences of autistic members of 13 such families to the gene sequences of people from a public database. They found four potential culprit genes and focused on one, CTNND2, because it fell in a region of the genome known to be associated with another intellectual disability. When they studied the gene s effects in zebrafish, mice and cadaveric human brains, the research group found that the protein it makes affects how many other genes are regulated. The CTNND2 protein was found at far higher levels in fetal brains than in adult brains or other tissues, Chakravarti says, so it likely plays a key role in brain development. While autism-causing variants in CTNND2 are very rare, Chakravarti says, the finding provides a window into the general biology of autism.  To devise new therapies, we need to have a good understanding of how the disease comes about in the first place,  he says.  Genetics is a crucial way of doing that.  Chakravarti s research group is now working to find the functions of the other three genes identified as possibly associated with autism. They plan to use the same principle to look for disease genes in future studies of 100 similar autism-affected families, as well as other illnesses.  We ve shown that even for genetically complicated diseases, families that have an extreme presentation are very informative in identifying culprit genes and their functions - or, as geneticists are taught,  treasure your exceptions.  Chakravarti says.","Published: March 28, 2015"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/protein-shakeup-206299,Protein Shake Up Researchers use neutron scattering and supercomputing to study shape of a protein involved in cancer  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. For living organisms proteins are an essential part of their body system and are needed to thrive. In recent years, a certain class of proteins has challenged researchers  conventional notion that proteins have a static and well-defined structure. It s thought that mutations in these proteins, known as intrinsically disordered proteins, are associated with neurodegenerative changes, cardiovascular disorders and diseases such as diabetes and cancer. A better understanding of these proteins could have major implications in the energy, environmental and health biosciences. One intrinsically disordered protein, beta-catenin, is of particular interest to researchers at the Department of Energy s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where they will be conducting neutron scattering and supercomputing studies to further uncover its role in cancer.  This protein violates everything we know about proteins,  says Arvind Ramanathan of ORNL s Computational Data Analytics Group.  It doesn t have a very stable secondary structure except for a small region which forms a kidney bean shape.   What we proposed to do is to take a look at the protein using neutron scattering and combine the data with large scale simulation of this molecule utilizing supercomputing capabilities at ORNL,  he says. The joint research project started after ORNL, Georgetown and Howard Universities, Washington Veteran s Affairs Medical Center and MedStar Research Institute won a Clinical Translation Science Award. The award is funded by the National Center for Advancing Translation Science, one of the institutes at the National Institutes of Health. The beta-catenin protein occurs naturally in the body and is active in a pathway that sends signals from outside a cell to the inside of a cell. One of its terminal ends responds to cancer, and researchers have observed negative effects during cancer if changes occur to this side.  Mutations in this protein usually impact drug resistance, relapse of cancers and many other important functional cellular roles during cancer,  Ramanathan says. To gain insight and a better idea of what beta-catenin s shape is and how the shape changes under various circumstances, the researchers plan to use neutron scattering techniques on ORNL s Spallation Neutron Source s EQ-SANS instrument.  On the neutron side, we are doing experiments that will allow us to characterize in very great detail how the protein changes its shape,  Ramanathan says. The data from the neutron experiments will then be analyzed using the supercomputing capabilities at DOE's Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility at ORNL. Additionally, the researchers will run simulations and model the protein while looking at other proteins to detect and characterize the protein s cancer responding terminal. What they learn from the study will help them understand how the B-catenin protein binds to its partner cells and how the process changes after a mutation has occurred, which is often associated with cancer.  If we don t understand how the protein binds specifically to certain signaling partners, we wouldn t know how to distinguish what its function is in a cancer related pathway versus a functional pathway,  Ramanathan says. The National Institutes of Health and National Center for Advancing Translation Science is providing funding for the study. The research involves the Spallation Neutron Source and the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, which are DOE Office of Science User Facilities.","Published: March 28, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/hiv-can-spread-early-evolve-in-patients-brains-196949,HIV can Spread Early  Evolve in Patients  Brains Findings add urgency to screening  treatment   NIH funded study  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The AIDS virus can genetically evolve and independently replicate in patients' brains early in the illness process, researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health have discovered. An analysis of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), a window into brain chemical activity, revealed that for a subset of patients HIV had started replicating within the brain within the first four months of infection. CSF in 30 percent of HIV-infected patients tracked showed at least transient signs of inflammation - suggesting an active infectious process - or viral replication within the first two years of infection. There was also evidence that the mutating virus can evolve a genome in the central nervous system that is distinct from that in the periphery. ""These results underscore the importance of early diagnosis and treatment with antiretroviral therapy,"" said Dianne Rausch, Ph.D., director of the Division of AIDS Research of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). ""Any delay runs the risk that the virus could find refuge and cause damage in the brain, where some medications are less effective - potentially enabling it to re-emerge, even after it is suppressed in the periphery."" NIMH grantees Serena Spudich, M.D., of Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut; Ronald Swanstrom, Ph.D., of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; Richard Price, M.D., University of California, San Francisco; and Christa Buckheit Sturdevant, Ph.D., UNC (now at Duke), and colleagues, report on their findings March 26, 2015, in the journal PLoS Pathogens. Prior to the study, it was known that HIV readily penetrates the brain and can trigger neurological problems and eventually cause dementia over the course of the infection. Yet there was little evidence about how quickly it can take hold and thrive there. Nor was it clear to what extent the brain serves as a hard-to-reach hideout from which the virus might re-infect the body - even if it is eliminated from peripheral blood and lymph node tissue by treatment. To learn more, the researchers compared evidence of HIV activity in CSF versus blood from 72 untreated HIV-infected patients over the first two years of their infection. Overall, 10-22 percent of the patients showed evidence of HIV replication or inflammation in the brain at the different time points analyzed within the first two years - and the signs persisted over time in about 16 percent of the participants. The evidence suggests that in most patients peripheral forms of the virus infect immune cells that spread to the brain via blood. Yet in some patients, genetic versions of the virus not found in blood evolve in the brain environment. So it could become an independent, compartmentalized viral reservoir, capable of generating treatment-resistant mutant forms that could break out and re-infect the rest of the body after seemingly successful treatment, explained Rausch. Whether the potential brain damage caused by early HIV replication and inflammation might be reversible with antiviral therapy awaits further research, said Swanstrom.","Published: March 28, 2015"

Cold-shock protein protects against neurodegeneration In the adult brain, communication between neurons is constantly remodeled by the elimination of old synapses and the formation of new ones. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases have fewer synapses compared to normally aging adults, suggesting that their brains have decreased structural plasticity. While it is difficult to analyze this plasticity across aging in humans, research on hibernating animals provides an important model to study structural plasticity at a molecular level.   Study shows association between migraine and carpal tunnel syndrome Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) are more than twice as likely to have migraine headaches, reports a study in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery -- Global Open , the official open-access medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. The association also runs in the other direction, with migraine patients having higher odds of carpal tunnel syndrome, according to research by Dr. Huay-Zong Law and colleagues of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. The findings add a new piece of evidence in the ongoing debate over the use of nerve decompression surgery as a treatment for migraine headaches.   Research into brain s ability to heal itself offers hope for novel treatment of traumatic brain injury Innovative angles of attack in research that focus on how the human brain protects and repairs itself will help develop treatments for one of the most common, costly, deadly and scientifically frustrating medical conditions worldwide: traumatic brain injury (TBI). In an extensive opinion piece recently published online in Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs, Henry Ford Hospital researcher Ye Xiong, M.D., Ph.D., makes the case for pioneering work underway in Detroit, Michigan, and elsewhere seeking to understand and repair brain function at the molecular level.   Mutations taking place only in the brain identified as the cause of intractable epilepsy Epilepsy afflicts more than 50 million people worldwide. Many epilepsy patients can control their symptoms through medication, but about 30% suffer from intractable epilepsy and are unable to manage the disease with drugs. Intractable epilepsy causes multiple seizures, permanent mental, physical, and developmental disabilities, and even death. Therefore, surgical removal of the affected area from the brain has been used as a treatment for patients with medically refractory seizures, but this too fails to provide a complete solution because only 60% of the patients who undergo surgery are rendered free of seizures.   Carbon nanotube fibers make superior links to brain Carbon nanotube fibers invented at Rice University may provide the best way to communicate directly with the brain. The fibers have proven superior to metal electrodes for deep brain stimulation and to read signals from a neuronal network. Because they provide a two-way connection, they show promise for treating patients with neurological disorders while monitoring the real-time response of neural circuits in areas that control movement, mood and bodily functions.","Published: March 27, 2015"

The findings, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, help to describe the conversation that takes place between the brain and brown fat tissue while brown fat is generating heat. Brown fat is considered ""good fat"" or ""healthy fat"" because it burns calories to help generate heat for our bodies and expend energy, while white fat stores energy for later and can increase the risk for health issues, such as diabetes and heart disease. A person with a healthy metabolism has less white fat and an active supply of brown fat. Studies show that brown fat plays a big role in someone having the capability to burn more energy, becoming a tool to stay trim and fight obesity. Pharmaceutical companies are trying to target brown fat and activate it more, said Johnny Garretson, study author and doctoral student in the Neuroscience Institute and Center for Obesity Reversal at Georgia State. The study found that when brown fat tissue was activated with a drug that mimics the sympathetic nervous system messages that normally come from the brain, the fat talked back to the brain by activating sensory nerves. The sensory nerves from brown fat increased their activity in response to direct chemical activation and heat generation. ""This is the first time that the function of sensory nerves from brown fat has been examined,"" Garretson said. ""Brown fat is an active organ that's relatively important for metabolism, and we found a new pathway of its communication. ""The study informs us more about the communication between fat and the brain, which is really beneficial for treating human obesity. There is evidence that people with more brown fat have a better metabolism, lower instances of type II diabetes and are trimmer. Knowing how to increase the amount of brown fat activity or increase the brown fat, that's the future of trying to figure out yet another way to try and lose weight effectively and quickly."" The researchers speculate that brown fat is telling the brain many things, such as how much heat is being generated, how much and what types of free energy are being used or stored, how much fat we have and how much fat we've lost. ""As brown fat gets hotter and starts to generate heat, being active and doing good things for our body, it increases our metabolism and helps us burn white fat,"" Garretson said. ""As it's getting hotter, Dr. (Vitaly) Ryu and other members of our lab found that it tells the brain it's getting hotter. We think this is some type of feedback, like a thermostat, and as it gets hotter, it probably controls how the brain is talking back to it."" It was already known the brain communicates with fat tissue by telling it to break down and either release or use free energy for our bodies to function. This study shows a feedback loop between brown fat tissue and the brain. The research team has studied the communication from fat to the brain and the brain to fat for years, but they're one of only a few labs in the world to examine communication from fat to the brain through the nervous system, Garretson said.

The PREVAIL trial, which began on Feb. 2, 2015 in Monrovia, Liberia, is testing the safety and efficacy of the cAd3-EBOZ candidate vaccine co-developed by NIAID scientists and GlaxoSmithKline, and the VSV-ZEBOV candidate vaccine developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed to NewLink Genetics Corporation and Merck. Volunteers are assigned at random to receive a single injection of the NIAID/GSK (cAd3-EBOZ) vaccine, the VSV-ZEBOV vaccine, or a placebo (saline) injection. The trial is also double-blinded, meaning that neither study subjects nor staff know whether a vaccine or placebo was administered. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is considered the  gold standard  in clinical research. While the initial enrollment goal in the Phase 2 study has been met and the vaccines proven safe, the researchers are continuing Phase 2 study enrollment at Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, through late April 2015. This would boost enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of the trial to approximately 1,500 people and would be done, in part, to increase the percentage of women (currently, about 16 percent) in the study for a more robust data set overall. The study follow-up period would be at least one year, and two additional blood samples would be obtained from all volunteers at six and 12 months post-vaccination to determine the durability of the immune responses. These proposed changes will be discussed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are under review by the institutional review boards in Liberia and the United States. Investigators planned to enroll 27,000 people in Liberia at risk of Ebola infection in the Phase 3 portion of the trial. However, there has been only one new confirmed case of Ebola infection in the country since Feb. 19, 2015. Given this decline in Ebola infection incidence, the trial leaders - H. Clif ford Lane, M.D., NIAID deputy director for clinical research, and Liberian co-principal investigators Stephen Kennedy, M.D., and Fatorma Bolay, Ph.D. - have determined that it is scientifically appropriate to expand the trial to additional sites in other West African countries. Discussions are underway to explore that possibility. The Liberia U.S. research team also plans to launch a separate natural history study of Ebola survivors to better understand the after-effects of Ebola virus disease. Four sites in Monrovia, Liberia and locations in the United States may begin enrollment into this study in the coming months, pending regulatory review and approval. More information on this study will be provided when the trial launches.","Published: March 27, 2015"

Now Toshiba Ltd and Kawasaki City Institute for Public Health have collaborated in the development of a rapid and efficient automatic abbreviated DNA detection technology that can test for 14 major types of food borne pathogens. The so called  DNA chip card  employs electrochemical DNA chips and overcomes the complicated procedures associated with genetic testing of conventional methods. The  DNA chip card  is expected to find applications in hygiene management in food manufacture, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. DetailsThe so-called automatic abbreviated DNA detection technology  DNA chip card  was developed by Toshiba Ltd and in a collaboration with Kawasaki City Institute for Public Health, used to simultaneously detect 14 different types of food-borne pathogens in less than 90 minutes. The detection sensitivity depends on the target pathogen and has a range of 1E+01~05 cfu/mL. Notably, such tests would usually take 4-5 days using conventional methods based on pathogen cultivation. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional DNA protocols that require high levels of skill and expertise, the  DNA chip card  only requires the operator to inject nucleic acid, thereby making the procedure easier to use and without specialized operating skills.

The study followed 72 treatment na ve participants during the first two years of HIV infection. Through analysis of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples, 20 percent of subjects showed replication in the central nervous system (CNS) at four months. Additionally, 30 percent of participants showed evidence of a marked CSF inflammatory response in at least one time point and 16 percent of study volunteers showed a marked CSF inflammatory response at multiple time points, suggesting an ongoing infection in the CNS. The findings are published in the journal PLoS Pathogens. ""This shows that viral replication and inflammation can occur early in infection with the concern being that the damage caused could be irreversible,"" says study virologist Ronald Swanstrom, PhD, Director of the University of North Carolina (UNC) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) and Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics at UNC's School of Medicine. ""HIV and inflammation have the potential to accelerate the aging process and cause neurocognitive impairment, in the extreme case resulting in HIV-associated dementia."" One-third of people not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) to control their HIV will eventually develop HIV-associated dementia, Swanstrom says. For him, the study's results in these newly infected people stress the importance of routine HIV testing to catch the infection as early as possible to allow the prompt initiation antiretroviral therapy. ""This is yet another reason we want people on ART right away to limit the possibility of replication and inflammation in the brain,"" Swanstrom says.

The results appear in a new study in the Journal of Neurotrauma. Many researchers have reported recent progress in identifying possible blood biomarkers for concussion   an advance sought because diagnosis is currently limited to cognitive measures that can be subjective. Most groups have focused on detecting proteins released from dying brain cells, but those proteins are not always abundant after injury and often require exotic or proprietary antibodies to measure, said study corresponding author Adam Chodobski, associate professor (research) of emergency medicine in the Alpert Medical School of Brown University.  Our approach was very different,  said Chodobski, also a Lifespan researcher who directs the Neurotrauma and Brain Barriers Research Laboratory.  We wanted to look at proteins that are produced in response to injury and then appear in the circulation.  With that approach, informed by prior research in animals, the research team ultimately identified four proteins (copeptin, galectin 3, matrix metalloproteinase 9 and occludin) that changed dramatically in the bloodstream of patients shortly after they had a concussion. The correlation of two of them   galectin 3 and occludin   distinguished patients who had concussion from subjects who suffered an orthopedic injury, such as a bone break. Chodobski s team, including lead author and former Brown student Rongzi Shan and researcher Joanna Szmydynger-Chodobska, structured the study to ensure that any biomarkers they found would be sensitive and specific for diagnosing concussion. Donor Diane Weiss and the Department of Emergency Medicine at Brown funded the effort. The team recruited three groups of patients, one experimental group and two controls. The experimental group comprised 55 emergency room patients who had concussions diagnosed by other means. One control group included 44 people who were uninjured, while the other control group contained 17 patients who had long-bone fractures. In all of the patients they measured 18 proinflammatory proteins. An analysis of the results identified four of the proteins as potential biomarkers. Specifically, within eight hours of injury, they found around a four-fold increase in the concentration of galectin 3, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and occluding, and a three-times lower concentration of copeptin in concussed patients compared to the uninjured controls. While uninjured individuals might have had a high level of one or the other of these proteins, none had high levels of two or more at a time, but 90 percent of the patients with concussion had significantly altered concentrations of two or more. When the researchers looked at a combination of three proteins in patients with concussion   copeptin, galectin 3, and matrix metalloproteinase 9   they found significant changes in the levels that provided a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for injury compared to the controls. While each of those three proteins was also significantly altered in patients with bone breaks, as was occludin, the researchers found that only in the concussed patients did elevated occludin correlate with elevated galectin 3. Thus the four proteins considered together not only can indicate concussions in people for whom a brain injury is the only suspected problem, but also they can distinguish the possibility of a concussion from that of an injury elsewhere in the body. Szmydynger-Chodobska noted that the four proteins  significance in indicating concussion endured regardless of patient age, gender, body-mass index or other medical characteristics.  This was a broad spectrum of the population with different genders, different ethnicities, different age, and different physical conditions, and on this background these four biomarkers were not influenced,  she said. The study indicated that the proteins are readily measurable with standard assays, but the team hopes to develop a microfluidic chip that can derive reliable readings within just two hours (well within the duration of many emergency room visits). They said they have already filed for a patent of the idea.  Our plan is to commercialize this,  Chodobski said. Szmydynger-Chodobska said the team is also interested in looking at the proteins as therapeutic targets. Although there is some debate, research suggests that some of these inflammatory proteins may affect the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. That might mean patients who suffer traumatic brain injury not only suffer from the physical damage of the blow to the head but also from the resulting inflammatory response, especially within the first 24 hours.  If you have a patient who has very high levels of MMP9, we can think about a treatment that blocks MMP9,  she said.  It degrades the tight junction proteins at the blood-brain barrier. If you open the blood brain barrier, unwanted things from the blood get to the brain and that just makes the situation worse and increases the inflammation.  The panel may therefore eventually help not only with diagnosis, the researchers said, but may also aid treatment during a critical window of time.

The multi-institutional study is led by Dr Michael Jarvis at Plymouth University, and is published, 25th March 2015, in Vaccine. African apes serve as a main source of ebolavirus transmission into the human population. As a consequence, the prevention of ebolavirus infection in African apes could reduce the incidence of future human ebolavirus outbreaks. Ebolavirus is also highly lethal to African apes, and is regarded as a major threat to the survival of these populations in the wild. Such a  disseminating  vaccine offers hope for both stabilizing these endangered ape populations and protecting humans against the devastating effects of Ebola. The innovative approach may overcome the major hurdle to achieving high vaccine coverage of these animals. They live in of some of the most remote, inaccessible regions of the world which makes conventional, individual vaccination near impossible. Apart from being very immunogenic (able to provoke an immune response) and species-specific, CMV can also spread easily from individual to individual, a process which remains remarkably unaffected by prior CMV immunity. This is the basis of the team s current innovative strategy of using a CMV-based ebolavirus vaccine that can spread through wild ape populations as a means to provide high levels of protective ebolavirus-specific immunity without the need for direct vaccination. The current publication expands on a 2011 study, in which the same collaborative research team first showed the ability of a CMV-based vaccine to provide protection against Ebola virus in a mouse challenge model. Most Ebola virus vaccine mouse studies, including this earlier 2011 study, have only assessed protection against Ebola virus infection shortly after vaccination (generally within six weeks post-vaccination). The present study showed that immunity induced by CMV is extremely long-lasting, with Ebola virus-specific immune responses being maintained for greater than 14 months (equivalent to half the life span of a mouse) following only a single dose of the vaccine. Importantly, immunity induced by the CMV vaccine was able to provide protection against Ebola virus at least until 119 days (approximately four months) post-vaccination. Long-lasting immunity will be critical for the eventual success of this disseminating vaccine approach. It is also an attractive characteristic for a (albeit non-disseminating) CMV-based Ebola virus vaccine for direct use in humans, which is an additional area of development of the current collaborative research group. The next step, which is nearing completion, is to trial the vaccine using CMV in the macaque EBOV challenge model (regarded as the  gold standard  for testing vaccines in a model translatable to Ebola infection in great apes and humans). The results from this study further support the utility of this approach and will be published in the next few months. Many questions clearly remain, including the nature of the immunity conferred by disseminated CMV vaccines (in the current study mice were directly inoculated).  We must walk before we can run, but this study provided a little skip,  said Dr. Michael Jarvis, corresponding author on the study from Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry.  However, this disseminating approach does potentially provide a workable solution to a currently intractable problem of achieving high vaccine coverage in inaccessible ape populations. Given the impact of ebolavirus on African ape numbers in the wild, and the role of apes as a route of ebolavirus transmission to humans via the bush meat trade, such a vaccine would be a win-win for humans and wild apes alike.  To this end the project has been incorporated as a component of an international research program, which includes key players such as the World Wildlife Fund and National Institutes of Health, which are dedicated to driving the project forward to mobilization.","Published: March 26, 2015"

Professor Caroline Dive, from the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute at The University of Manchester - part of the Manchester Cancer Research Centre - who jointly led the study, said:  Here in Manchester we are interested in detecting cancer cells that have been shed from a patient s tumour and are circulating in their blood. In this study we wanted to see if the number of tumour cells in a blood sample could be linked to how well patients respond to intensive chemotherapy.  The group looked at patients with advanced colorectal cancer who received a four-drug combination treatment. They confirmed that those patients with three or more circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in their blood sample had a lower overall survival, compared with those patients who had fewer than three CTCs. The team also presented data that suggested that patients with a higher CTC count before treatment could benefit more from this more intensive treatment regimen. Dr Mark Saunders, a Consultant Oncologist from The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, who also led the study, said:  Our initial results suggest that this test could prove useful for patient selection and we should now validate it in further larger trials of new treatments for bowel cancer.  Dr Matt Krebs, Clinical Senior Lecturer at The University of Manchester and part of the study team, added:  These studies are important for the development of a more personalized treatment approach for cancer patients where patients receive the treatments most likely to benefit them.  Cancer is one of The University of Manchester s research beacons - examples of pioneering discoveries, interdisciplinary collaboration and cross-sector partnerships that are tackling some of the biggest questions facing the planet.","Published: March 26, 2015"

But unlike DNA, which has a single job, RNA can play many parts - including acting as a precursor for small molecules that block the activity of genes. These small RNA molecules must be trimmed from long hairpin-loop structures, raising a question: How do cells know which RNA loops need to be processed this way and which don t? New research at Rockefeller University, published March 18 in Nature, reveals how cells sort out the loops meant to encode small RNAs, known as microRNAs, by tagging them with a chemical group. Because microRNAs help control processes throughout the body, this discovery has wide-ranging implications for development, health and disease, including cancer, the entry point for this research.  Work in our lab and elsewhere has shown changes in levels of microRNAs in a number of cancers. To better understand how and why this happens, we needed to first answer a more basic question and take a closer look at how cells normally identify and process microRNAs,  says study author Sohail Tavazoie, Leon Hess Associate Professor, Senior Attending Physician and head of the Elizabeth and Vincent Meyer Laboratory of Systems Cancer Biology.  Claudio Alarc n, a research associate in my lab, has discovered that cells can increase or decrease microRNAs by using a specific chemical tag.  Long known as the intermediary between DNA and proteins, RNA has turned out to be a versatile molecule. Scientists have discovered a number of RNA molecules, including microRNAs that regulate gene expression. MicroRNAs are encoded into the genome as DNA, then transcribed into hairpin loop RNA molecules, known as primary microRNAs. These loops are then clipped to generate microRNA precursors. To figure out how cells know which hairpin loops to start trimming, Alarc n set out to look for modifications cells might make to the RNA molecules that are destined to become microRNAs. Using bioinformatics software, he scanned for unusual patterns in the unprocessed RNA sequences. The sequence GGAC, code for the bases guanine-guanine-adenine-cytosine, stood out because it appeared with surprising frequency in the unprocessed primary microRNAs. GGAC, in turn, led the researchers to an enzyme known as METTL3, which tags the GGAC segments with a chemical marker, a methyl group, at a particular spot on the adenine.  Once we arrived at METTL3, everything made sense. The methyl in adenosines (m6A tag) is the most common known RNA modification. METTL3 is known to contribute to stabilizing and processing messenger RNA, which is transcribed from DNA, but it is suspected of doing much more,  Alarc n says.  Now, we have evidence for a third role: the processing of primary microRNAs.  In series of experiments, the researchers confirmed the importance of methyl tagging, finding high levels of it near all types of unprocessed microRNAs, suggesting it is a generic mark associated with these molecules. When they reduced expression of METTL3, unprocessed primary microRNAs accumulated, indicating that the enzyme s tagging action was important to the process. And, working in cell culture and in biochemical systems, they found primary microRNAs were processed much more efficiently in the presence of the methyl tags than without them.  Cells can remove these tags, as well as add them, so these experiments have identified a switch that can be used to ramp up or tamp down microRNA levels, and as a result, alter gene expression,  Tavazoie says.  Not only do we see abnormalities in microRNAs in cancer, levels of METTL3 can be altered as well, which suggests this pathway is could govern cancer progression. ","Published: March 26, 2015"

Fragile X is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and the most frequent genetic cause of autism. Fragile X, which is caused by a mutation in a single gene on the X chromosome, affects about 1 in 4,000 men and 1 in 6,000 women. Even more common are Fragile X carriers of a lesser change in the Fragile X gene called a premutation, occurring in 1 in 450 men and 1 in 150 women. Fragile X premutation carriers have normal intellect, but some can develop physical symptoms over time. They are also more likely to develop social anxiety and depression. In the study, researchers compared 35 women who had the premutation to 35 women who did not have this genetic change. The participants took tests of their brains' executive functioning skills, such as inhibition and selective attention, and rated themselves on scales for depression and social anxiety. They also had blood tests to measure the amount of methylation in the Fragile X gene. Methylation adds methyl groups to some of the DNA, which inactivates that part of the X chromosome. Methylation is one type of so-called epigenetic changes, alterations in genes during the lifetime that affect their expression. The researchers found that the women with the premutation who had high methylation levels were more likely to have depression, social anxiety and problems with executive functioning skills. In this group, worse scores on the executive function skills were correlated with having increased symptoms of anxiety and depression; this relationship was not seen in the women who did not have the premutation. ""These results are exciting, because it means we could use an easily accessible blood test to help diagnose people who have the premutation genetic abnormality and identify who is more likely to have problems and begin early treatment,"" said study author Kim M.

Their study of 40 children, followed from before birth until 7 to 9 years of age as part of the Center's large community-based cohort, is published online in JAMA Psychiatry. Neurotoxic PAH are ubiquitous in the environment, in the home and in the workplace. Emissions from motor vehicles, oil and coal burning for home heating or power generation, wildfires and agricultural burning, hazardous waste sites, tobacco smoke and charred foods are all sources of exposure. PAH readily crosses the placenta and affects an unborn child's brain; earlier animal studies showed that prenatal exposure impaired the development of behavior, learning and memory. Scientists led by Bradley S. Peterson, MD, director of the Institute for the Developing Mind at The Saban Research Institute of CHLA, along with Virginia Rauh, ScD, and Frederica Perera, DrPH, PhD, from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, conducted a study of minority youth to test the effects on brain structure of PAH exposure during the final trimester of pregnancy. They used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the brains of 40 children from a cohort of more than 600 mother-baby pairs from minority communities in New York City. The Columbia researchers had previously reported that exposure to airborne PAH during gestation in this cohort was associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disturbances, including development delay by age 3, reduced verbal IQ at age 5, and symptoms of anxiety and depression at age 7. ""This is the largest MRI study to date of how early life exposure to air pollutants, specifically PAH, affect the developing mind,"" said Peterson, who is also a professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. ""Our findings suggest that PAH are contributors to ADHD and other behavioral problems due to the pollutants' disruptive effects on early brain development."" The study showed reductions in nearly the entire white matter surface of the brain's left hemisphere -- loss associated with slower processing of information during intelligence testing and more severe behavioral problems, including ADHD and aggression. Postnatal PAH exposure -- measured at age 5 -- was found to contribute to additional disturbances in development of white matter in the dorsal prefrontal region of the brain, which is associated with concentration, reasoning, judgment, and problem-solving ability. Peterson explained that the morphological features associated with ADHD symptoms in this community sample differed from those previously reported in youth with the disorder, suggesting that exposure to high levels of PAH may produce a specific subtype of ADHD. Peterson explained that the study's findings were limited to a minority population with a high level of poverty and low educational attainment, and may therefore not generalize to other populations, although impoverished urban minority populations are disproportionately exposed to air pollutants. While this initial study size was also limited, the researchers are currently undertaking a much larger study in order to confirm and extend their findings. ""Our findings raise important concerns about the effects of air pollutants on brain development in children, and the consequences of those brain effects on cognition and behavior,"" says Peterson.

This barrier runs inside almost all vessels in the brain and protects it from elements circulating in the blood that may be toxic to the brain. The research is important as currently 98% of therapeutic molecules are also unable to cross the blood-brain barrier.  The barrier is temporary opened at a desired location for approximately 2 hours by a small elevation of the temperature generated by the nanoparticles when exposed to a radio-frequency field,  explained first author and co-inventor Seyed Nasrollah Tabatabaei.  Our tests revealed that this technique is not associated with any inflammation of the brain. This new result could lead to a breakthrough in the way nanoparticles are used in the treatment and diagnosis of brain diseases,  explained the co-investigator, H l ne Girouard.  At the present time, surgery is the only way to treat patients with brain disorders. Moreover, while surgeons are able to operate to remove certain kinds of tumors, some disorders are located in the brain stem, amongst nerves, making surgery impossible,  added collaborator and senior author Anne-Sophie Carret.   Although the technology was developed using murine models and has not yet been tested in humans, the researchers are confident that future research will enable its use in people.  Building on earlier findings and drawing on the global effort of an interdisciplinary team of researchers, this technology proposes a modern version of the vision described almost 40 years ago in the movie Fantastic Voyage, where a miniature submarine navigated in the vascular network to reach a specific region of the brain,  said principal investigator Sylvain Martel. In earlier research, Martel and his team had managed to manipulate the movement of nanoparticles through the body using the magnetic forces generated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines. To open the blood-brain barrier, the magnetic nanoparticles are sent to the surface of the blood-brain barrier at a desired location in the brain. Although it was not the technique used in this study, the placement could be achieved by using the MRI technology described above. Then, the researchers generated a radio-frequency field. The nanoparticles reacted to the radio-frequency field by dissipating heat thereby creating a mechanical stress on the barrier. This allows a temporary and localized opening of the barrier for diffusion of therapeutics into the brain. The technique is unique in many ways.  The result is quite significant since we showed in previous experiments that the same nanoparticles can also be used to navigate therapeutic agents in the vascular network using a clinical MRI scanner,  Martel remarked.   Linking the navigation capability with these new results would allow therapeutics to be delivered directly to a specific site of the brain, potentially improving significantly the efficacy of the treatment while avoiding systemic circulation of toxic agents that affect healthy tissues and organs,  Carret added.  While other techniques have been developed for delivering drugs to the blood-brain barrier, they either open it too wide, exposing the brain to great risks, or they are not precise enough, leading to scattering of the drugs and possible unwanted side effect,  Martel said. Although there are many hurdles to overcome before the technology can be used to treat humans, the research team is optimistic.  Although our current results are only proof of concept, we are on the way to achieving our goal of developing a local drug delivery mechanism that will be able to treat oncologic, psychiatric, neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, amongst others,  Carret concluded.

The normal function of the UPR pathway is to protect cells from stress but it can also trigger their death if the stress is not resolved. The researchers  discovery of a control switch that acts on the UPR pathway, published in the online edition of EMBO Reports, opens new drug development avenues for treating a wide variety of diseases by modulating the UPR pathway to prevent excessive cell death.  Our paper reports that two highly conserved pathways   the UPR and the nonsense-mediated RNA decay pathway   intersect with each other at a pivotal point in cell stress,  said Miles Wilkinson, PhD, senior author and professor in the Department of Reproductive Medicine and a member of the UC San Diego Institute for Genomic Medicine.  In essence, we ve shown that the nonsense-mediated RNA decay pathway, typically referred to as  NMD,  keeps the UPR in check to avoid the potentially dangerous consequences if the UPR pathway were allowed to mount an inadvertent response to innocuous stress.  In cells, like people, too much stress can cause bad things to happen. In the case of cells, one such bad consequence is the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cell s protein-making factory. To carry out their many biological functions, proteins must be precisely folded in the correct shape. The body s answer to excessive cell stress and accompanying misshapen proteins is the unfolded protein response. The UPR kicks in and restores normal ER-folding capacity by adjusting certain cellular processes. If this fails, the UPR instructs the cell to self-destruct, a process known as programmed cell death or apoptosis.   Wilkinson describes the UPR pathway as a double-edged sword.  In a large number of diseases, ranging from cancer to ALS, major stress occurs in the affected cells, leading the UPR pathway to be triggered,  he said.  And that s meant to be helpful. But if the stress isn t relieved in a timely fashion, it triggers cell death.  A limited amount of cell death is normal, but if too many cells die, especially critical cells, then it s a problem. Chronic UPR activation and excessive cell death has been implicated in brain disorders like Alzheimer s and Parkinson s disease.    In their study, Wilkinson, with first author Rachid Karam, PhD, and colleagues found that the NMD pathway plays a critical role in shaping the activities of UPR. Specifically, they discovered that NMD prevents inappropriate activation of the UPR and also promotes its timely termination to protect cells from prolonged ER stress.  Because of the important role of UPR in regulating cell life/death decisions, it is critical that mechanisms are in place to prevent unnecessary UPR activation in response to innocuous or low-level stimuli,  said Wilkinson.  In this report we demonstrate that the NMD pathway serves in this capacity by raising the threshold for triggering UPR and also promoting its shut off at the appropriate time.    He added that NMD doesn t deter the UPR if an important stress comes along where more action is needed.  Although NMD normally represses the UPR, our paper and previous work have shown that it gets out of the way if there s a real problem,  Wilkinson noted. Previous studies from the Wilkinson group and others have established that NMD has two broad roles. First, it is a quality control mechanism used by cells to eliminate faulty messenger RNA (mRNA)   molecules that are essential for transcribing genetic information into the construction of proteins critical for life. Second, NMD degrades a specific group of normal mRNAs.   The latest study shows that NMD suppresses inappropriate UPR activities by driving the rapid decay of several normal mRNAs encoding proteins critical for the UPR.  We demonstrate that NMD directly targets the mRNAs encoding several UPR components, including the highly conserved UPR sensor, IRE1-alpha, whose NMD-dependent degradation partly underpins this process,  said Wilkinson.   Our work not only sheds light on UPR regulation, but demonstrates the physiological relevance of NMD s ability to regulate normal mRNAs.

The article appears in the Journal of Neuroscience. Researchers have been working for decades to map out how Alzheimer s disease wields its devastating effects. Although it s known that two molecules   tau and amyloid beta   are considered responsible for the disease s progression, the relationship between these two proteins and resulting memory problems has remained unclear. Brain cells depend on tau protein to form highways for the cell to get nutrients and get rid of waste. In some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s disease, the tau protein changes into a more toxic oligomer form. When this happens, molecular nutrients can no longer move to where they are needed and the brain cells eventually die. Scientists from UTMB have previously shown their anti-tau oligomer immunotherapy reduced levels of tau oligomers and reversed memory deficits in an animal model of Alzheimer s. In the current study, it came as a surprise that the immunotherapy also reduced amyloid beta oligomer levels, suggesting that the detrimental effects of amyloid beta are dependent on the presence of toxic forms of tau.  Our findings with this immunotherapy study indicate a link between tau oligomers and amyloid beta,  said lead author and associate professor of neurology, Rakez Kayed.  Because of this relationship, removing tau oligomers with our immunotherapy may also decrease the harmful effects amyloid beta and mitigate memory deficits.  What sets Kayed's therapy apart from other tau immunotherapy drugs is that his targets only the toxic oligomer form of tau and leaves the normal tau alone and able to carry out its typical functions. These findings provide strong evidence of the benefits of targeting tau oligomers with immunotherapeutic approaches as an Alzheimer s disease treatment.

Writing in the latest issue of the journal Neurocase, Dr Hanna Cho and her colleagues relate the story of a patient who, with no prior musical training, learned to play the saxophone after being diagnosed with a behavioural variant of FTD.  In fact, over three years of daily practice in the face of otherwise  progressive cognitive decline and overall apathy , the patient mastered 10 Korean folk songs so well that he outshone the others in his class without a cognitive impairment. The case of the middle-aged man known only as 'J.K.' is significant because while some patients with FTD experience  an artistic enhancement  of their existing visual or musical abilities, there has been no record to date of anyone learning to play an instrument after diagnosis.  The researchers put forward three possible explanations for 'J.K' s unusual skill, mostly to do with the sparing by FTD of particular abilities or parts of his brain, in particular his basal ganglia and cerebellum (preserving his procedural, non-declarative forms of memory and basic motor skills), his visuo-constructive abilities (allowing him to sight-read and play music) and his right hemisphere (where 'asymmetric hemisphere degeneration' might have predisposed him to develop artistic talents.  But whatever the reason for the patient s virtuoso saxophone playing, this study and the medical observations, case notes and images detailed within it pose interesting questions   and perhaps some answers   for dementia research.  It also has intriguing implications for the use of music therapy and music-based cognitive rehabilitation in FTD patients.

A recent study from the University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital provides scientific evidence for this everyday belief. The findings show that a newborn s ability to fixate relates to the microscopic maturation of brain structures, and it predicts visual cognitive abilities later in childhood. A study performed in the University of Helsinki and the Children s Hospital within Helsinki University Central Hospital shows that the visual abilities of the newborn predict childhood development of visual processing. The study also showed that the newborn ability to fixate on objects is related to the level of maturation at the microscopic level studied by magnetic resonance imaging. An abnormal newborn fixation associates with widespread changes in the white matter tracts. These findings support the idea that key cognitive abilities are already present in a newborn infant, and later neurocognitive development proceeds as a cascade that builds on these early cognitive building blocks. Poor visual cognitive abilities are the most common lifelong compromise in children born very prematurely or with oxygen deprivation at birth, says Dr. Sampsa Vanhatalo, the leader of this study, and adjunct professor in clinical neurophysiology. Learning the early development of visual abilities will hopefully open new pathways to early recognition of cognitive problems, and, consequently, we will learn how to help the infant and prevent development of visual cognitive disabilities, says child neurologist Dr. Aulikki Lano, the head of neurological examinations in the project. Vanhatalo points out another key conclusion of their study: a well done clinical examination may be as informative of a child s future as many of the technologically advanced research methods currently popular. Most adults with experience in babysitting or other child care have always paid attention to the eye contact of the child. It is somewhere deep in the back of our minds to note when a newborn has abnormal eye contact, yet its significance has not been shown in scientific studies. This new study provides evidence as to the scientific relevance of this intuitive experience; however, it also opens new possibilities for developing research and care in pediatric neurology. These results have convinced the researchers of the necessity to develop objective and quantitative measures of eye contact in the newborn. They could help us recognize children with developmental risks right after birth. Such a method would open unprecedented vistas in developing new therapeutic interventions that could start from the first months of life, which is even years before the problems become apparent using current approaches, says Dr. Marjo Mets ranta, Adjunct Professor in neonatology. The study was done in the Children s hospital, Helsinki University Central Hospital, and it analyzed two different cohorts of neonates. The first cohort included 57 babies recruited in 2006-2007, and it included 42 extremely preterm infants. At term age, the children were tested for their visual abilities, and scanned with advanced magnetic resonance imaging, followed by neuropsychological assessment at two years of age. The second cohort consisted of 1,410 newborns recruited 1985 - 86 as a part of a very large, population-based follow-up study (called  Arvo Ylpp  Longitudinal Study ). Altogether 948 of these infants had been hospitalized for various reasons, and about one-fifth of them were born preterm. These children were re-assessed for general reasoning and visual-motor abilities at five years of age.

The fibers have proven superior to metal electrodes for deep brain stimulation and to read signals from a neuronal network. Because they provide a two-way connection, they show promise for treating patients with neurological disorders while monitoring the real-time response of neural circuits in areas that control movement, mood and bodily functions. New experiments at Rice demonstrated the biocompatible fibers are ideal candidates for small, safe electrodes that interact with the brain's neuronal system, according to the researchers. They could replace much larger electrodes currently used in devices for deep brain stimulation therapies in Parkinson's disease patients. They may also advance technologies to restore sensory or motor functions and brain-machine interfaces as well as deep brain stimulation therapies for other neurological disorders, including dystonia and depression, the researchers wrote. The paper appears online in the American Chemical Society journal ACS Nano. The fibers created by the Rice lab of chemist and chemical engineer Matteo Pasquali consist of bundles of long nanotubes originally intended for aerospace applications where strength, weight and conductivity are paramount. The individual nanotubes measure only a few nanometers across, but when millions are bundled in a process called wet spinning, they become thread-like fibers about a quarter the width of a human hair. ""We developed these fibers as high-strength, high-conductivity materials,"" Pasquali said. ""Yet, once we had them in our hand, we realized that they had an unexpected property: They are really soft, much like a thread of silk. Their unique combination of strength, conductivity and softness makes them ideal for interfacing with the electrical function of the human body."" The simultaneous arrival in 2012 of Caleb Kemere, a Rice assistant professor who brought expertise in animal models of Parkinson's disease, and lead author Flavia Vitale, a research scientist in Pasquali's lab with degrees in chemical and biomedical engineering, prompted the investigation. ""The brain is basically the consistency of pudding and doesn't interact well with stiff metal electrodes,"" Kemere said. ""The dream is to have electrodes with the same consistency, and that's why we're really excited about these flexible carbon nanotube fibers and their long-term biocompatibility."" Weeks-long tests on cells and then in rats with Parkinson's symptoms proved the fibers are stable and as efficient as commercial platinum electrodes at only a fraction of the size. The soft fibers caused little inflammation, which helped maintain strong electrical connections to neurons by preventing the body's defenses from scarring and encapsulating the site of the injury. The highly conductive carbon nanotube fibers also show much more favorable impedance -- the quality of the electrical connection -- than state-of-the-art metal electrodes, making for better contact at lower voltages over long periods, Kemere said. The working end of the fiber is the exposed tip, which is about the width of a neuron. The rest is encased with a three-micron layer of a flexible, biocompatible polymer with excellent insulating properties. The challenge is in placing the tips. ""That's really just a matter of having a brain atlas, and during the experiment adjusting the electrodes very delicately and putting them into the right place,"" said Kemere, whose lab studies ways to connect signal-processing systems and the brain's memory and cognitive centers. Doctors who implant deep brain stimulation devices start with a recording probe able to ""listen"" to neurons that emit characteristic signals depending on their functions, Kemere said. Once a surgeon finds the right spot, the probe is removed and the stimulating electrode gently inserted. Rice carbon nanotube fibers that send and receive signals would simplify implantation, Vitale said. The fibers could lead to self-regulating therapeutic devices for Parkinson's and other patients. Current devices include an implant that sends electrical signals to the brain to calm the tremors that afflict Parkinson's patients. ""But our technology enables the ability to record while stimulating,"" Vitale said. ""Current electrodes can only stimulate tissue. They're too big to detect any spiking activity, so basically the clinical devices send continuous pulses regardless of the response of the brain."" Kemere foresees a closed-loop system that can read neuronal signals and adapt stimulation therapy in real time. He anticipates building a device with many electrodes that can be addressed individually to gain fine control over stimulation and monitoring from a small, implantable device. ""Interestingly, conductivity is not the most important electrical property of the nanotube fibers,"" Pasquali said. ""These fibers are intrinsically porous and extremely stable, which are both great advantages over metal electrodes for sensing electrochemical signals and maintaining performance over long periods of time.""

Researchers at Imperial College London analyzed brain scans from over 1,500 healthy people to develop a computer program that could predict a person's age from their brain scan. Then they used the program to estimate the ""brain age"" of 113 more healthy people and 99 patients who had suffered traumatic brain injuries. The brain injury patients were estimated to be around five years older on average than their real age. Head injuries are already known to increase the risk of age-related neurological conditions such as dementia later in life. The age prediction model may be useful as a screening tool to identify patients who are likely to develop problems and to target strategies that prevent or slow their decline. ""Your chronological age is not necessarily the best indicator of your health or how much longer you will live,"" said Dr James Cole, who led the study, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London. ""There is a lot of interest in finding biomarkers of aging that can be used to measure a certain aspect of your health and predict future problems."" The study, published in the Annals of Neurology, used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study changes in brain structure. The researchers used a machine learning algorithm to develop a computer program that could recognize age-related differences in the volume of white matter and gray matter in different parts of the brain. The model was then used to estimate subjects' ages based on their brain scans. The study included 99 patients with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) caused by road accidents, falls or assaults, who had persistent neurological problems. The scans were taken between one month and 46 years after their injuries. In healthy controls, the average difference between predicted age and real age was zero. In TBI patients, the difference was significantly higher, with a bigger discrepancy in patients with more severe injuries. Bigger differences in predicted age were associated with cognitive impairments such as poor memory and slow reaction times. There was also a correlation between time since injury and predicted age difference, suggesting that these changes in brain structure do not occur during the injury itself, but result from ongoing biological processes, potentially similar to those seen in normal aging, that progress more quickly after an injury. ""Traumatic brain injury is not a static event,"" said Dr Cole. ""It can set off secondary processes, possibly related to inflammation, that can cause more damage in the brain for years afterwards, and may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia."" The researchers believe the age prediction model could be applied not just to TBI patients, but might also be useful to screen outwardly healthy people. ""We want to do a study where we use the program to estimate brain age in healthy people, then see if the ones with 'old brains' are more likely to get neurodegenerative diseases. If it works, we could use it to identify people at high risk, enroll them in trials and potentially prescribe treatments that might stave off disease,"" said Dr Cole.

The challenge provides a new template for drug discovery as it seeks to rapidly uncover the best opportunities for discovery research. Scientists who participate in the challenge are asked to submit details about the biological targets or pathways they are researching and the scientific rationale detailing how this early-stage research could direct future drug development. Up to 12 proposals will be selected, across all regions, based on the strength of the scientists  hypotheses, originality, initial progress and the ability to deliver on an unmet medical need. Scientists whose entries are selected will collaborate with GSK s DPAc and Molecular Discovery Research teams to test their hypotheses on potential disease pathways or targets against GSK s extensive library of compounds. If a compound is identified during this process that shows activity against these pathways or targets, and could form the starting point for the development of a new medicine, the winning investigators could be offered a formal DPAc partnership and opportunity to work together on the development of a potential new medicine.  The Discovery Fast Track Challenge is a unique opportunity to integrate the deep biological expertise found in academia with the extensive drug development knowledge of GSK,  said Carolyn Buser, Global Head of Discovery Partnerships with Academia (DPAc), the challenge s sponsor.  Winning ideas are translated into a high throughput screen to identify tool compounds for additional proof-of-concept studies. Pending the results and the interests from both academia and GSK, the collaboration may be extended to a long-term partnership to jointly develop therapeutics for the benefit of patients worldwide.  Since its initial launch in 2013, the annual Discovery Fast Track Challenge has attracted more than five hundred proposals from more than three hundred universities, academic research institutions and hospitals in the US, Canada and Europe. Previous entries have focused on a broad range of disease areas, including malaria, antibiotic resistance and certain types of cancer. Launched in the UK in late 2010, DPAc is a new approach to drug discovery where academic partners become core members of drug-hunting teams. GSK and the academic partner share the risk and reward of innovation, where GSK funds activities in the partner laboratories, as well as providing in-kind resources to progress a programme from an idea to a candidate medicine. The DPAc model is now being used by GSK globally. To date, GSK has initiated 15 collaborations in 15 disease areas worldwide. Dr. Richard Leduc, Ph.D., Chairman of the Department of Pharmacology-Physiology at Universit  de Sherbrooke in Quebec, Canada   the first academic to enter Discovery Fast Track, and selected as a winner of the 2013 challenge   proposed an innovative approach for treating iron overload disorder (IOD).

Its symptoms can be gruesome and devastating, as the bacteria reduce sensitivity in the body, resulting in skin lesions, nerve damage and disabilities. Until recently, leprosy was attributed to a single bacterium, Mycobacterium leprae; we now suspect that its close relative, Mycobacterium lepromatosis, might cause a rare but severe form of leprosy. EPFL scientists have analyzed for the first time the complete genome of M. lepromatosis, and compared it to that of the major leprosy-causing bacterium. Published in PNAS, the study reveals the origin and evolutionary history of both bacteria, and offers new insights into their biology, global distribution, and possibly treatment. Along with its mutilating symptoms, leprosy also carries a stigma, turning patients into social outcasts. Although we have been able to push back the disease with antibiotics, leprosy remains endemic in many developing countries today. Leprosy can manifest itself in various forms, all thought to be caused by the bacterium M. leprae. But in 2008, a study showed considerable evidence that another species of bacterium, M. lepromatosis, causes a distinct and aggressive form of the disease called  diffuse lepromatous leprosy , found in Mexico and the Caribbean. Studying the genome of M. lepromatosis The lab of Stewart Cole at EPFL s Global Health Institute carried out a genome-wide investigation on M. lepromatosis. This complex and computer-heavy technique looks at the bacterium s entire DNA, locating its genes along the sequence. Because M. lepromatosis cannot be grown in the lab and animal models for this version of leprosy do not exist yet, the scientists used an infected skin sample from a patient in Mexico to obtain the bacterium s genetic material. After extracting the DNA from the entire sample, the researchers had to separate the bacterial DNA from the patient s. To do this, they used two genetic techniques: one that increased the bacterium s DNA and another that decreased the human DNA. With the bacterium s DNA isolated, the researchers were able to sequence it and read it. Once they had the complete sequence of the bacterium s genome, they were able to compare it with the known genome of M. leprae, the bacterium responsible for the majority of leprosy cases. The study found that the two species of bacteria are very closely related. The comparative genomics analysis could  backtrack  the history of their genes, and showed that the two bacteria have diverged 13.9 million years ago from a common ancestor with a similar genome structure, and possibly a similar lifestyle. That ancestor suffered a process known as  gene decay , where over a long period of time and multiple generations, a large number of genes mutated, became non-functional, and eventually disappeared. The study showed that the two new species continued to lose genes but from different regions of their genomes, indicating that during their evolution they occupied different biological roles and mechanisms to ensure survival. Cole s team also conducted a study on over two hundred skin samples from leprosy patients in Asia, Africa, and the Americas to determine the geographic distribution of M. lepromatosis. The results showed that the bacterium is relatively scarce, and seems to be restricted to patients in Mexico. In contrast, the major leprosy-causing bacterium M. leprae is widespread across the world. The study also discovered that M. lepromatosis has retained the genes needed to infect cells of the nervous system called Schwann cells. These produce protective sheaths that wrap around the axons of peripheral neurons. Although Schwann cell infection is a hallmark of M. leprae leprosy, the presence of related genes in M. lepromatosis means that this bacterium could also be attacking these cells. This will become clearer in future investigations, facilitated in part by the resources generated by this work. This genome-wide comparative study offers new and deeper insights into the biology of M. lepromatosis. By uncovering the evolutionary history of the two leprosy bacteria, it can open up new ways for developing therapeutic strategies. This study represents a collaboration of EPFL s Global Health Institute with the University of Tu bingen, the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, and the Universidad Auto noma de Nuevo Leo n.

The drugs work together to shrink human pancreas tumors in mice as successfully as the current standard treatment, but at one twelfth the dosage. This lower dosage could reduce both the cost of treatment and the side effects that people suffer from the current method. The study was led by Dr. Huan Meng, assistant adjunct professor of medicine, and Dr. Andre Nel, distinguished professor of medicine, both at the Jonsson Cancer Center. Pancreatic cancer, a devastating disease with a five-year survival rate of 5 percent, is difficult to detect early and symptoms do not usually appear until the disease is advanced. As a result, many people are not diagnosed until their tumors are beyond the effective limits of surgery, leaving chemotherapy as the only viable treatment option. The chemotherapy drug most often used for pancreas cancer is gemcitabine, but its impact is often limited. Recent research has found that combining gemcitabine with another drug called paclitaxel can improve the overall treatment effect. In the current method, Abraxane   a nano complex containing paclitaxel   and gemcitabine are given separately, which works to a degree, but because the drugs may stay in the body for different lengths of time, the combined beneficial effect is not fully synchronized.  The beauty of the silica nanoparticle technology is that gemcitabine and paclitaxel are placed together in one special lipid-coated nanoparticle at the exact ratio that makes them synergistic with one another when co-delivered at the cancer site, giving us the best possible outcome by using a single drug carrier,  Meng said.  This enables us to reduce the dose and maintain the combinatorial effect.                                                                        After the scientists constructed the silica nanoparticles, they suspended them in blood serum and injected them into mice that had human pancreas tumors growing under their skin. Other mice with tumors were given injections of saline solution (a placebo with no effect), gemcitabine (the treatment standard), and gemcitabine and Abraxane (an FDA-approved combination shown to improve pancreas cancer survival in humans). In the mice that received the two drugs inside the nanoparticle, pancreas tumors shrank dramatically compared with those in the other mice. Similar comparisons were made with mouse models, in which the human tumors were surgically implanted into the mice s abdomens in order to more closely emulate the natural point of origin of pancreatic tumors and provide a better parallel to the tumors in humans. In these experiments, the tumors in the mice receiving silica nanoparticles shrank more than the comparative controls. Also, metastasis, or tumor spread, to nearby organs was eradicated in these mice.  Instead of just a laboratory proof-of-principle study of any cancer, we specifically attacked pancreatic cancer with a custom-designed nanocarrier,  said Nel, who is also associate director for research of the California NanoSystems Institute.  In our platform, the drugs are truly synergistic because we have control over drug mixing, allowing us to incorporate optimal ratios in our particles, making the relevance of our models very high and our results very strong.

But although the mechanisms that spur the destruction of neurons in Alzheimer s disease are not yet fully understood, two well-documented signs of the condition are accumulation of the amyloid-  peptide (the main component of plaques found in Alzheimer s patient brains) and chronic inflammation. New research from Rockefeller University, published March 16 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, identifies a bridge between the two. That bridge, a molecular cascade known as the contact system, may provide opportunities for early diagnosis of the disease through simple blood tests.  People have been looking for a long time for markers for Alzheimer s disease,  says Sidney Strickland, head of the Patricia and John Rosenwald Laboratory of Neurobiology and Genetics. But current diagnostic tests for pre-symptomatic Alzheimer s leave much to be desired. Evaluating the level of amyloid-  in the cerebral spinal fluid, for instance, requires an invasive spinal tap procedure.  Finding a blood biomarker that would let us know through a simple test whether someone is on their way to developing the disease would be a significant advance,  says first author Daria Zamolodchikov, a postdoctoral associate in the Strickland lab. The new study grew from the lab s ongoing work that looks at how the vascular system is involved in Alzheimer s disease. It has been shown that amyloid-  can activate a protein in plasma called factor XII, the first step in a pathway known as the contact system. When activated, this system leads to the release of a small peptide called bradykinin, a molecule known to promote potentially damaging inflammation. Although some studies have found these molecules in the cerebral spinal fluid and brain tissue of Alzheimer s patients, no one had studied them in Alzheimer s patient plasma. Using plasma from people with and without diagnosed Alzheimer s disease, the researchers measured the activation levels of the contact system. They found increased activation of this system in the plasma of Alzheimer s patients, potentially implicating it in the inflammatory pathology of the disease. Moreover, in a subset of patients whose amyloid-  levels in the cerebral spinal fluid were known, the researchers demonstrated a positive correlation between activation of the contact system and changes in cerebral spinal fluid amyloid-  levels, which as mentioned above are correlated with the development of Alzheimer s. The researchers found similar activation of the contact system in mouse models of Alzheimer s, which are genetically modified to overproduce amyloid- . They then conducted a follow-up experiment with healthy mice.  We went one step further and took completely normal wild-type mice and injected them with amyloid- . We found that on its own, injection with amyloid-  can activate this system. It s a proof of principle in a complex environment,  says Zamolodchikov. These findings will need to be supported by studies in larger patient populations and longitudinal studies, but they could eventually open the door to diagnosis of pre-symptomatic Alzheimer s based on blood levels of these molecules. The contact system may also offer a new approach to therapies for Alzheimer s disease, since inhibition of the pathway could blunt some of the inflammatory aspects of the disease. One concern is that the contact system is also involved in blood clotting and inhibition might carry a risk of bleeding. However, people with a defect in this system do not have hemophilia. Thus, inhibition of this pathway might slow progression of the disease without increasing the risk of hemorrhage.","Published: March 25, 2015"

The findings move researchers closer to identifying those at risk for addiction early and designing better drug treatments to help people stop drinking. About 18 million people in the United States have an alcohol use disorder, according to National Institutes of Health statistics. The vast majority go untreated.  There are few and inadequate pharmacological treatments to help people who want to stop drinking, because this is a terrifically difficult human genetics problem,  said Jill C. Bettinger, Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, VCU School of Medicine.  If we can better understand the molecular effects of alcohol, we can design more rational treatments and even warn people who are more susceptible to developing a dependence.  Bettinger is the senior author of a paper,  SWI/SNF Chromatin Remodeling Regulates Alcohol Response Behaviors in Caenorhabditis Elegans and is Associated With Alcohol Dependence in Humans,  published Feb. 23 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The paper describes how researchers examined the role of a protein complex   called switching defective/sucrose nonfermenting (SWI/SNF)   in determining the behavioral response of roundworms to alcohol. Researchers watched through microscopes as the tiny worms became drunk on ethanol, studying how their initial sensitivity to the alcohol and tolerance changed based on which genes were expressed within the SWI/SNF complex. Because humans and worms have a similar genetic makeup, Bettinger then turned to Brien P. Riley, Ph.D., associate professor in the Departments of Psychiatry and Human and Molecular Genetics at VCU School of Medicine and co-author of the recently published paper. Riley is director of the Molecular Genetics Lab at the Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, where researchers have been studying the human genome and its relationship to the risk of illness or other traits. Riley found that naturally occurring genetic variations in the same SWI/SNF complex so crucial to a worm s tolerance were also associated with alcohol dependence in humans. Unlike Huntington s and other diseases, which can be linked to a mutation in a single gene, the evidence suggests that the likelihood to develop alcoholism is the product of mutations in many genes, each with small effect. The SWI/SNF complex genes represent a piece of that puzzle. The findings also give researchers a perfect model moving forward in their studies.  The identification of genes that are critical in the development of tolerance in model systems such as worms will lead to future progress in understanding human dependence on alcohol,  Riley said.  If the same effects are seen in worms, then it allows us to form and test a functional hypothesis about what kinds of changes lead to increased dependence risk in humans.  Along with Bettinger and Riley, the paper s authors include Laura D. Mathies, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology; Andrew G. Davies, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology; GinaMari G. Blackwell, laboratory and research specialist; Makeda K. Austin, research intern; and Alexis C.

The collaboration also aims to better understand how the function of beta cells declines in diabetes and research findings will be made available to the broader scientific community through peer-reviewed publications. In people with Type 1 diabetes, beta cells are destroyed by an autoimmune response and patients must inject insulin to maintain normal blood glucose levels. In Type 2 diabetes, the beta cells either fail to function properly or their numbers decrease. Human beta cells for research are extremely limited in number and availability. However, a team led by HSCI co-chairman and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, Professor Doug Melton, has developed a technique which allows limitless quantities of beta cells to be produced from human induced pluripotent stem cells generated directly from adult cells, similar in all important respects to those found in healthy individuals. AstraZeneca will provide funding for a team of investigators at HSCI lead by Professor Melton as well as establishing an in-house team in M lndal, Sweden, dedicated to the collaboration. Scientists from each organisation will work together to understand the biology behind the loss of human beta cell function and mass in diabetes, and to screen compounds against the cells produced to search for potential new medicines that could restore beta cell activity in diabetic patients. Marcus Schindler, Head of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases, Innovative Medicines and Early Development, AstraZeneca, said:  We are excited about the potential of this latest collaboration with Harvard University. Professor Melton s group has made an extraordinary breakthrough in the differentiation of human stem cells into human beta cells and our scientists are extremely excited to be working alongside his team. Harnessing this new technology has the potential to transform the research and development of new treatments for patients with diabetes.  Isaac T. Kohlberg, Head of the Office of Technology Development at Harvard University, said:  AstraZeneca s commitment to establish and fund this collaboration will help advance the development of new medicines that may ameliorate the need for diabetics to inject insulin, and prevent the numerous, potentially fatal complications of diabetes. This collaboration is an ideal example of how academia and industry should work together to serve the public interest and make a difference in the lives of patients.  The collaboration is aligned with AstraZeneca s strategic research approach in diabetes which is aimed at restoring the function of the pancreatic beta cells as well as insulin sensitivity, irrespective of therapeutic modality.

Access to Premaitha s test will allow Genoma to apply the CE-IVD marking to its NIPT for trisomies 21, 18 and 13. The IONA  test is the first CE-marked in vitro diagnostic (IVD) product for NIPT. It uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to estimate the risk of a fetus having Down s syndrome (Trisomy 21), Edwards  syndrome (Trisomy 18) and Patau s syndrome (Trisomy 13) by analysing cell-free fetal DNA from a sample of maternal blood. The NIPT test is more sensitive and specific than the current combined test, providing accurate and reliable results to pregnant women. The benefits of NIPT are a higher detection rate and lower false positive rate than existing screening tests, giving pregnant women, their families and their doctors greater confidence in the result. This further reduces the need for unnecessary invasive follow-up tests and the associated anxiety and stress. Dr Stephen Little, CEO of Premaitha said:  This agreement with Genoma to provide our CE-marked NIPT solution to its laboratories is a major milestone for us as Premaitha s first sale in Europe. Genoma has the strength of infrastructure and the high technical expertise to be able to accelerate the broad dissemination of NIPT in Europe, ensuring its benefits are available to many pregnant women. The completion of this agreement so soon after receiving our CE mark is also a major achievement. We hope this will be the first of many agreements for the IONA  test and we look forward to a strong and fruitful partnership with Genoma.  Dr Frederic Amar, CEO of Genoma said:  The CE-IVD certification will allow us to bring our NIPT test TRANQUILITY  to the next level. Premaitha offers us the access to a technology that has proven to be efficient, fast, and robust. We will carry out the TRANQUILITY  NIPT test in our state-of-the-art genetic analysis laboratories located in Geneva, in accordance with the highest quality standards.

The 101 fuel cell stack was initially tested at AFC s UK facility in late February, then shipped to Germany, installed and has been operating continuously since 3 March 2015. AFC s technical team were highly encouraged that initial gas flow, thermal management and consistency of individual fuel cell performance across the 101 cells are in-line with expectations. The relative uniformity of fuel cell performance affirms the quality focus of AFC s increasingly automated manufacturing and production facilities. Whilst the first successful 101 fuel cell stack trial demonstrates the operability of the fundamental building block of the KORE system, it also allows AFC to consider alternative products of varying capacities modularized at the size of the 101 cell cartridge, rather than a single focus on the previously scoped 240kW KORE system. In this context, AFC s market offering becomes increasingly flexible to meet the needs of smaller energy requirements (in integers of 10kWs). AFC is currently in discussions with potential customers and partners who are assessing opportunities sized at the single cartridge size which again widens AFC s possible market potential and commercialization potential in the short term. Adam Bond, AFC s Chief Executive Officer, said:  The rate of progress made by AFC stechnical team over the past three months in progressing beyond the 25 cell stack, through the 51 cell stack and up to a full complement of 101 fuel cells is unprecedented in AFC s history.

That's the finding from a Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, which shows the brain learns words quickly by tuning neurons to respond to a complete word, not parts of it. Neurons respond differently to real words, such as turf, than to nonsense words, such as turt, showing that a small area of the brain is ""holistically tuned"" to recognize complete words, says the study's senior author, Maximilian Riesenhuber, PhD, who leads the GUMC Laboratory for Computational Cognitive Neuroscience. ""We are not recognizing words by quickly spelling them out or identifying parts of words, as some researchers have suggested. Instead, neurons in a small brain area remember how the whole word looks -- using what could be called a visual dictionary,"" he says. This small area in the brain, called the visual word form area, is found in the left side of the visual cortex, opposite from the fusiform face area on the right side, which remembers how faces look. ""One area is selective for a whole face, allowing us to quickly recognize people, and the other is selective for a whole word, which helps us read quickly,"" Riesenhuber says. The study asked 25 adult participants to learn a set of 150 nonsense words. The brain plasticity associated with learning was investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), both before and after training. Using a specific fMRI technique know as fMRI-rapid adaptation, the investigators found that the visual word form area changed as the participants learned the nonsense words. Before training the neurons responded like the training words were nonsense words, but after training the neurons responded to the learned words like they were real words. ""This study is the first of its kind to show how neurons change their tuning with learning words, demonstrating the brain's plasticity,"" says the study's lead author, Laurie Glezer, PhD. The findings not only help reveal how the brain processes words, but also provides insights into how to help people with reading disabilities, says Riesenhuber. ""For people who cannot learn words by phonetically spelling them out -- which is the usual method for teaching reading -- learning the whole word as a visual object may be a good strategy."" In fact, after the team's first groundbreaking study on the visual dictionary was published in Neuron in 2009, Riesenhuber says they were contacted by a number of people who had experienced reading difficulties and teachers helping people with reading difficulties, reporting that learning word as visual objects helped a great deal. That study revealed the existence of a neural representation for whole written real words -- also known as an orthographic lexicon --the current study now shows how novel words can become incorporated after learning in this lexicon. ""The visual word form area does not care how the word sounds, just how the letters of the word look together,"" he says.

But what hasn t been clear is why fat accumulates in different places to produce these classic  apple  and  pear  shapes. Now, researchers have discovered that a gene called Plexin D1 appears to control both where fat is stored and how fat cells are shaped, known factors in health and the risk of future disease. Acting on a pattern that emerged in an earlier study of waist-to-hip ratios in 224,000 people, the study, which appears March 23 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that zebrafish that were missing the Plexin D1 gene had less abdominal or visceral fat, the kind that lends some humans a characteristic apple shape. The researchers also showed that these mutant zebrafish were protected from insulin resistance, a precursor of diabetes, even after eating a high-fat diet.  This work identifies a new molecular pathway that determines how fat is stored in the body, and as a result, affects overall metabolic health,"" said John F. Rawls, Ph.D., senior author of the study and associate professor of molecular genetics and microbiology  at Duke University School of Medicine.  Moving forward, the components of that pathway can become potential targets to address the dangers associated with visceral fat accumulation.  Unlike the subcutaneous fat that sits beneath the skin of the hips, thighs, and rear of pear-shaped individuals, visceral fat lies deep within the midsection, wedged between vital organs like the heart, liver, intestine, and lungs. From there, the tissue emits hormones and other chemicals that cause inflammation, triggering metabolic diseases like high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and diabetes. Despite the clear health implications of body fat distribution, relatively little is known about the genetic basis of body shape. A large international study that appeared in Nature in February began to fill in this gap by looking for regions of the human genome associated with a common metric known as the waist-to-hip ratio, which uses waist measurements as a proxy for visceral fat and hip measurements as a proxy for subcutaneous fat. The researchers analyzed samples from 224,000 people and found dozens of hot spots linked to their waist-hip ratio, including a few near a gene called Plexin D1 which is known to be involved in building blood vessels.  Rawls and his postdoctoral fellow James E. Minchin, Ph.D., were curious about how a gene for growing blood vessels might control the storage and shape of fat cells. When they knocked out the Plexin D1 gene in mice, all of the mutant animals died at birth. So they turned to another model organism, the zebrafish, to conduct the rest of their experiments. Because these small aquarium fish are transparent for much of their lives, the researchers could directly visualize how fat was distributed differently between animals that had been genetically engineered to lack Plexin D1 and those with the gene still intact. By using a chemical dye that fluorescently stained all fat cells, the researchers could see that the mutant zebrafish had less visceral fat than their normal counterparts. They also noticed that the shape or morphology of the fat cells themselves was different. The zebrafish without the Plexin D1 gene had visceral fat tissue that was composed of smaller, but more numerous cells, a characteristic known to decrease the risk of insulin resistance and metabolic disease in humans. In contrast, their normal siblings had visceral fat tissue containing larger, but fewer fat cells of the kind known to be more likely to leak inflammatory substances that contribute to illness. To determine how these findings related to metabolic disease, Minchin put the zebrafish on a high-fat diet. After a few weeks of adding egg yolks to their typical chow, Minchin found that the differences in fat distribution between the mutant and the normal zebrafish became even more pronounced. He then gave the fish a glucose tolerance test to see how their bodies responded to sugar. The mutants did a better job of clearing sugar out of their bloodstream and seemed to be protected from developing insulin resistance, a risk factor for diabetes and heart disease. Bolstering the zebrafish findings, collaborators at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden analyzed human patient samples and showed that levels of Plexin D1 were higher in individuals with type 2 diabetes, suggesting it may play a similar role in humans.  We think that Plexin D1 is functioning within blood vessels to pattern the environment in visceral fat tissue,"" said Minchin, who was lead author of the study. That is, the genes that build blood vessels are also setting up structures to house fat cells. ""And this role skews the distribution and shape of fat in one direction or another,  he said.  It is probably just one of many of different genes that each contribute to overall body shape and metabolic health.  The researchers are actively searching for other genes as well as environmental factors that are involved in the biology of body fat, again using zebrafish models.

However, finding it early has been among the disease s greatest challenges. Now, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have developed a noninvasive method to screen for kidney cancer that involves measuring the presence of proteins in the urine. The findings are reported March 19 in the journal JAMA Oncology. The researchers found that the protein biomarkers were more than 95 percent accurate in identifying early-stage kidney cancers. In addition, there were no false positives caused by non-cancerous kidney disease.  These biomarkers are very sensitive and specific to kidney cancer,  said senior author Evan D. Kharasch, MD, PhD. Kidney cancer is the seventh most common cancer in men and the 10th most common in women, affecting about 65,000 people each year in the United States. About 14,000 patients die of the disease annually. Like most cancers, kidney tumors are easier to treat when diagnosed early. But symptoms of the disease, such as blood in the urine and abdominal pain, often don t develop until later, making early diagnosis difficult.  The most common way that we find kidney cancer is as an incidental, fortuitous finding when someone has a CT or MRI scan,  said Kharasch, the Russell D. and Mary B. Shelden Professor of Anesthesiology.  It s not affordable to use such scans as a screening method, so our goal has been to develop a urine test to identify kidney cancer early.  When kidney cancer isn t discovered until after it has spread, more than 80 percent of patients die within five years. With researchers from the Siteman Cancer Center, the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology and the Division of Urologic Surgery, Kharasch and principal investigator Jeremiah J. Morrissey, PhD, professor of anesthesiology, analyzed urine samples from 720 patients at Barnes-Jewish Hospital who were about to undergo abdominal CT scans for reasons unrelated to a suspicion of kidney cancer. Results of the scans let the investigators determine whether or not patients had kidney cancer. As a comparison, they also analyzed samples from 80 healthy people and 19 patients previously diagnosed with kidney cancer. The researchers measured levels of two proteins in the urine   aquaporin-1 (AQP1) and perlipin-2 (PLIN2). None of the healthy people had elevated levels of either protein, but patients with kidney cancer had elevated levels of both proteins. In addition, three of the 720 patients who had abdominal CT scans also had elevated levels of both proteins. Two of those patients were diagnosed subsequently with kidney cancer, and the third patient died from other causes before a diagnosis could be made.  Each protein, or biomarker, individually pointed to patients who were likely to have kidney cancer, but the two together were more sensitive and specific than either by itself,  said Morrissey.  When we put the two biomarkers together, we correctly identified the patients with kidney cancer and did not have any false positives.  Even when patients had other types of non-cancerous kidney disease, levels of the two proteins in the urine were not elevated and did not suggest the presence of cancer.  Patients with other kinds of cancer or other kidney diseases don t have elevations in these biomarkers,  Kharasch said.  So in addition to being able to detect kidney cancer early, another advantage of using these biomarkers may be to show who doesn t have the disease.  Not all kidney masses found by CT scans turn out to be cancerous, he said. In fact, about 15 percent are not malignant.  But a CT scan can only tell you whether there is a mass in the kidney, not whether it s cancer,  Kharasch said.  Currently, the only way to know for sure is to have surgery, and unfortunately, 10 to 15 percent of kidneys removed surgically turn out not to be cancerous.  Kharasch and Morrissey are working to develop an easy-to-use screening test for kidney cancer, much like mammograms, colonoscopies or other tests designed to identify cancer at early, more treatable stages before patients have symptoms.  By and large, patients don t know they have kidney cancer until they get symptoms, such as blood in the urine, a lump or pain in the side or the abdomen, swelling in the ankles or extreme fatigue,  Morrissey said.  And by then, it s often too late for a cure. Metastatic kidney cancer is extremely difficult to treat, and if the disease is discovered after patients have developed symptoms, they almost always have metastases. So we re hoping to use the findings to quickly get a test developed that will identify patients at a time when their cancer can be more easily treated. ","Published: March 24, 2015"

The approach requires fewer steps, uses less energy, and achieves better performance than several techniques currently in use and could lead to better technologies for medical diagnostics and chemical purification. The biomolecule sorting technique was developed in the laboratory of Joanna Aizenberg, Amy Smith Berylson Professor of Materials Science at Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology. Aizenberg is also co-director of the Kavli Institute for Bionano Science and Technology and a core faculty member at Harvard s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, leading the Adaptive Materials Technologies platform there. The new microfluidic device, described in a paper appearing today in the journal Nature Chemistry, is composed of microscopic  fins  embedded in a hydrogel that is able to respond to different stimuli, such as temperature, pH, and light. Special DNA strands called aptamers, that under the right conditions bind to a specific target molecule, are attached to the fins, which move the cargo between two chemically distinct environments. Modulating the pH levels of the solutions in those environments triggers the aptamers to  catch  or  release  the target biomolecule. After using computer simulations to test their novel approach, in collaboration with Prof. Anna C. Balazs from the University of Pittsburgh, Aizenberg s team conducted proof-of-concept experiments in which they successfully separated thrombin, an enzyme in blood plasma that causes the clotting of blood, from several mixtures of proteins. Their research suggests that the technique could be applicable to other biomolecules, or used to determine chemical purity and other characteristics in inorganic and synthetic chemistry.  Our adaptive hybrid sorting system presents an efficient chemo-mechanical transductor, capable of highly selective separation of a target species from a complex mixture all without destructive chemical modifications and high-energy inputs,  Aizenberg said.  This new approach holds promise for the next-generation, energy-efficient separation and purification technologies and medical diagnostics.  The system is dynamic; its integrated components are highly tunable. For example, the chemistry of the hydrogel can be modified to respond to changes in temperature, light, electric and magnetic fields, and ionic concentration. Aptamers, meanwhile, can target a range of proteins and molecules in response to variations in pH levels, temperature, and salt.  The system allows repeated processing of a single input solution, which enables multiple recycling and a high rate of capture of the target molecules,  said lead author Ximin He, Assistant Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Arizona State University and formerly a postdoctoral research fellow in Aizenberg s group at Harvard. Conventional biomolecule sorting systems rely on external electric fields, infrared radiation, and magnetic fields, and often require chemical modifications of the biomolecules of interest. That means setups can be used only once or require a series of sequential steps. In contrast, said Ankita Shastri, a graduate student in Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard and a member of Aizenberg s group, the new catch-transport-and-release system  is more efficient requiring minimal steps and less energy, and effective achieving recovery of almost all of the target biomolecule through its continuous reusability.  The authors say that the system could provide a means of removing contaminants from water and even be tailored to enable energy-efficient desalination of seawater. It could also be used to capture valuable minerals from fluid mixtures. Other contributors to the work include Lynn M. McGregor and Yolanda Vasquez from Harvard University; Ya Liu, Amitabh Bhattacharya, Yongting Ma, and Olga Kuksenok from the University of Pittsburgh; Valerie Harris, Hanqing Nan, and Maritza Mujica from Arizona State University; and Michael Aizenberg from the Wyss Institute.

Dr. Steven Driver from Genzyme Sanofi / USA was happy to receive the second prize for the project Genzyme Gas Fired Boiler Burner. The third price went to CEJN / Sweden for their eSafe coupling, presented by Peter Damgren. The winner of the ener.CON EUROPE Award 2015 is Holcim Technology Ltd / Switzerland with the project FANi - Fan Efficiency Initiative. Having started in 2013, the projects aim was to improve the efficiency of fans as key machineries that consumed about 30 to 50 % of the electrical energy used in cement plants. A R&D project was launched to develop a portable gas flow sensor and a low-cost fan assessment and on-line monitoring tool-set. Pilot application testing end of 2013 revealed a huge power saving potential of large fans. A global fan initiative (FANi) was developed with the goal to generate benefits of more than 10 million CHF per year. A core team of 3 men developed a roll-out procedure, 8 regional workshops with more than 150 participants have been executed and 412 fans have been assessed worldwide. In the end the savings have exceeded the expectations. Markus Rufle, Electrical Energy Engineer, and Urs Herzog, Power Solutions & New Technologies Assistant Vice-President, received the prize and thanked the entire Holcim team for their hard work. The second place went to Genzyme Sanofi / USA for its Genzyme Gas Fired Boiler Burner project. To reduce Genzyme s carbon footprint, a steam boiler gas fired burner project was completed using new Lipsfield technology. Two 800HP boilers operated with standard burners and control linkages (approx. 7 years old) were retrofit with the new technology. Installation of new high efficiency low O2 burners resulted in a carbon emissions reduction of 1800 metric tons (MTCO2) of carbon per year. After implementation, the annual natural gas savings result was 25 % and 250,000 therms with a cost savings of $182,000. The five year net present value for this project is $550,000 with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 200 %. The project savings was confirmed by installing inline gas meters, taking hourly readings, measuring steam output, condensate flow and temperature. The return on investment was 6 months validated by a Professional Registered Engineer. The project will save 9000 MTCO2 over the next 5 years equivalent to planting 204,071 trees. Dr. Steven Driver, Energy Director and Global Engineering, was happy to receive this prize and thanked his colleague Timothy Rossini, the manager of this project at Genzyme. CEJN AB / Sweden, worldwide key-player in phosphate-based products and production, received the third place for their eSafe project that had started in 2010. The cost of compressed air is high and is increasing every day - almost 30 % of the compressed air produced by a company goes to waste. CEJNs project aimed to produce an innovative coupling with minimum energy loss in order to use compressed air in the most efficient way. Increasing the flow and reducing the pressure drop in the coupling were the main challenges. CAD based flow calculation programs were used to find flow limitations. The project leader Peter Damgren proofs that it is possible to combine top class performance and reduction of the carbon footprint. The prize money of   2,000 was donated to HELP, a German non-governmental relief organization which provides humanitarian assistance for refugees, regardless of race, creed or nationality. The organization s overall policy is  help to self-help  in order to empowering people to improve their environment self-propelling.

The agreement is a further endorsement of the demand in the translational sequencing market for accurate and reliable reference material to validate sample testing. Horizon s reference materials will be available for sale alongside Archer  FusionPlex  ALK fusion tests that can run on both Illumina  and Ion Torrent  next-generation sequencing platforms, a fast-growing market that represented $2.5 billion in 2014 and Horizon anticipates that the Archer assay will prove to be well received by the market. Further financial details of the deal were not disclosed. The Archer  FusionPlex  ALK, RET, ROS1 Panel simultaneously detects and identifies both known and previously unidentified fusions and mutations of human ALK, RET and ROS1 (c-ros oncogene 1) genes from tumour samples, including formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) preserved specimens. ALK fusions of genetic markers ALK, RET, ROS1, are found in approximately 3-7% of lung tumours and are an important clinical marker for non-small cell lung cancer. The anti-cancer drug Crizotinib, marketed by Pfizer, acts as an ALK and ROS1 inhibitor and is approved to treat certain late-stage non-small cell lung cancers that express the abnormal anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene, alongside an approved companion diagnostic. It is therefore essential to have accurate and reliable molecular diagnostic testing prior to beginning therapy. Horizon s Reference Materials offer a high quality, sustainable source of independent external controls to laboratories, proficiency schemes and manufacturers, providing an unprecedented level of control. The reference materials include standards for the increasing number of  rare  mutations being targeted for cancer therapeutics, which by definition are hard to find in clinical samples. Dr Paul Morrill, President, Products Business, Horizon Discovery Group, said:  Our agreement with Archer is a recognition of the importance of providing controls alongside a targeted sequencing assay, and as an important OEM agreement is a milestone for Horizon. We are delighted that ArcherDX has chosen to include our HDx Reference Material alongside their assay kits.  Dr Jason Myers, CEO of ArcherDX, commented:  The three genes in this particular FusionPlex assay can be oncogenic drivers in lung cancer, which makes them great candidates for targeted therapies. The low incidence rates of these mutations make it difficult for laboratories to find renewable sources of controls. By combining HDx Reference Material with the Archer panel, we are able to offer a method to ensure consistency and accuracy. ","Published: March 24, 2015"

Duckett, Cleveland and their teams will look for compounds that affect a key enzyme involved in the degradation and ultimate recycling of damaged cellular material. This process, called  autophagy,  is an ancient, cannibalistic (literally  self-eating ) pathway that acts as the main recycling center of all cells. In autophagy, bulk cytoplasmic material and aged or damaged organelles are recycled via the lysosome to recoup essential building blocks and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a survival strategy during times of stress or nutrient limitation. Autophagy is an important cell survival pathway, and any defects in its regulation can lead to a variety of disorders, including neurodegenerative disorders, liver disease and cancer. The study is focused on targeting a particular enzyme, UNC-51-like kinase-1 (Ulk1), a critical on-off switch that regulates this pathway.  Using these funds, we will identify new inhibitors of Ulk1,  Duckett said.  Developing selective molecular probes that function as Ulk1-specific inhibitors would improve our understanding of the autophagy pathway, its relationship to cancer and its utility as a target that could augment conventional or targeted anti-cancer treatments.  Duckett and his colleagues plan to use the high-throughput screening facilities at Scripps Florida and the Scripps Drug Discovery Library and its 650,000-plus library of small-molecule compounds.

It s caused by a waxy substance called plaque that builds up inside the blood vessels of the heart. Risk factors include unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of physical activity, unhealthy diet, and excess weight. Making lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, following a healthy diet, and being physically active, often can help prevent or treat heart disease. Medicines such as statins, which lower LDL cholesterol, may be prescribed if lifestyle changes aren't enough. Genetics also plays a role in heart disease risk. Numerous genetic variations known as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with disease risk. A group of researchers from Brigham and Women s Hospital, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and Massachusetts General Hospital asked whether a composite of these SNPs could predict people who are at risk for heart disease complications and who might benefit the most from statin therapy. The team analyzed data from 5 studies representing more than 48,000 people who had experienced almost 3,500 coronary heart disease-related events such as heart attack and death. The researchers calculated a genetic risk score for each participant based on 27 heart disease-associated SNPs and divided them into low, intermediate, and high genetic risk categories. The work was funded in part by NIH s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Results appeared online on March 4, 2015, in The Lancet. The scientists found that people with a high genetic risk score had an increased risk of coronary heart disease, even after adjusting for traditional risk factors such as age, cholesterol levels, and smoking history. Participants in the high genetic risk category had an approximately 70% greater risk of heart attack compared with those at lowest genetic risk. The genetic risk score also predicted the ability of statin therapy to reduce the risk of a coronary heart disease-related event, such as a heart attack. Statin therapy resulted in 13%, 29%, and 48% relative risk reductions in the low, intermediate, and high genetic risk groups, respectively. This suggests that people with the highest genetic risk could have the largest clinical benefit from statin therapy.  There is ongoing debate over which individuals should be allocated statin therapy to prevent a first heart attack,  says co-first author Dr. Nathan O. Stitziel of Washington University.  Genetics appears to be one way to identify high-risk patients.   These findings could play an important role in helping physicians understand which patients will benefit the most from statin therapy,  adds co-first author Dr. Jessica L. Mega of Brigham and Women s Hospital. The researchers note that genetic risk scores could also be used to help select participants for clinical trials, as they could identify people who might benefit most from a specific therapy, such as statins.","Published: March 24, 2015"

Their work has produced the first haplotype map of wheat that provides detailed description of genetic differences in a worldwide sample of wheat lines. In genetics, a haplotype map is a powerful tool for transferring sequence-level variation to multiple gene mapping projects. ""All of these new, genomic-based strategies of breeding promise to significantly accelerate breeding cycles and shorten release time of future wheat varieties,"" said Eduard Akhunov, associate professor of plant pathology and the project's leader. Plant scientists often look at the genetic makeup of an organism to breed new varieties for specific, desirable traits, such as drought, pest or disease resistance. Akhunov said the haplotype map gives scientists quick access to rich, genetic variation data that increases the precision of mapping genes in the wheat genome, and improves scientists' ability to select the best lines in breeding trials. Akhunov's research associates, Katherine Jordan and Shichen Wang, are lead authors of the study, ""A haplotype map of allohexaploid wheat reveals distinct patterns of selection on homoeologous genomes,"" which will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Genome Biology. The project was coordinated through the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium, and included groups in Canada, Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. Much of the work took place in Kansas State University's Integrated Genomics Facility. The study included 62 wheat lines from around the world that were either modern cultivars or varieties not previously improved through formal breeding techniques, called landraces. To reduce the complexity of the wheat genome, the research team developed a tool called ""exome capture assay"" to perform targeted sequencing of only functional parts of the larger wheat genome. This technique bypasses those parts of the genome that are repetitive, according to Akhunov. The scientists found 1.6 million locations - called single nucleotide polymorphisms - in the genome where the wheat lines differed from one other. The research team used this information to describe the impact of these differences on the function of tens of thousands of wheat genes. ""Once genes controlling agronomic traits are identified, they can be used for improving wheat using not only traditional breeding approaches, but also new strategies that are based on biotechnology and molecular biology,"" Akhunov said. ""In the future, we will expand the set of wheat lines characterized using our sequencing strategy by including not only more genetically and geographically diverse wheat lines, but also by including close and distant relatives of wheat,"" he said. ""These wheat relatives are known for being a reservoir of valuable genes for agriculture that can improve abiotic and biotic stress tolerance or other quality traits, and increase yield."" Akhunov said that genomics-based approaches are now being introduced into every wheat breeding program worldwide. ""I am sure that we will see the impact of diversity resources developed at Kansas State University on wheat breeding within three to five years,"" he said. In addition to Jordan and Wang, the Kansas State University research team included Alina Akhunova and Yanni Lun, who coordinated work in the Integrated Genomics Facility; and plant pathology faculty member Christopher Toomajian. ""This study would be impossible without the computational and genomic infrastructure developed by K-State Research and Extension, the College of Agriculture and Kansas State University over the last five to seven years,"" Akhunov said.

Past studies have found many genetic alterations involved in lung cancer development. However, tumor growth and metastasis occurs amid complex, evolving, and diverse genetic changes. A major challenge in understanding the cancer genome is to identify the genetic changes that specifically drive the process of tumor development. To systematically test the effects of mutations across the cancer genome, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and their colleagues used a technique called a CRISPR-Cas screen to disrupt specific sequences. Bacteria use the CRISPR-Cas system to protect themselves from invaders. Short stretches of genetic material from bacteriophages (viruses that attack bacteria) and plasmids (pieces of DNA exchanged between bacteria) are incorporated into the system to detect targets for destruction in the future. For target sequences, the scientists used a pooled genome-wide mouse library of more than 67,000 short genetic sequences called single-guide RNAs, or sgRNAs. The library included more than 20,000 protein-coding genes and almost 1,200 microRNA sequences, which help regulate gene expression and have been implicated in various cancers. Using a cell line derived from a mouse non-small-cell lung cancer, they added the CRISPR-Cas system genes and then the sgRNA library. The work, led by Drs. Feng Zhang and Phillip Sharp, was funded by NIH s National Cancer Institute (NCI) and others. Results were published on March 12, 2015, in Cell. When injected under the skin of immunocompromised mice, the collection of mutant cells formed tumors at the injection site that metastasized to the lungs. Late primary tumors contained only a fraction of all the sgRNAs in the collection less than 4%. Metastases were dominated by a very small number of sgRNAs on average, only 3.4 per lung. These results suggested that cells with greater ability to proliferate dominated the tumors over time, and that metastases were seeded by a small set of cells. The team tested a more select pool of sgRNAs from lung metastases in the genome-wide screen. This approach allowed them to quickly test multiple sgRNAs and see how the mutations competed. Mice transplanted with this subpool had a dramatically higher rate of lung metastasis. The metastases retained only a small fraction of sgRNAs, suggesting that these sgRNAs can outcompete others during tumor growth and metastasis. Mutations in many of the identified genes have been implicated in human cancers. When the team analyzed gene expression in metastatic tumors from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, most of the genes (up to 75%) were downregulated. Future sequencing of patient metastases may further connect the genes identified in this study to the clinic.  Tumor evolution is an extremely complex set of processes, or hallmarks, controlled by networks of genes,  Sharp says. Identifying the changes that are important for tumor development could lead to more targeted therapies, better prevention, and new detection strategies.","Published: March 24, 2015"

Van Vliet's group last year showed that three biomechanical and biophysical markers could accurately identify the most desirable stem cells from a mixed group of bone marrow-derived cells. Now, MIT biological engineering graduate student Frances Liu is trying to advance that work by understanding how to alter the stem cells  physical environment to get them to produce the most desirable chemical output. The bone marrow cells secrete special chemicals called cytokines that are needed in the body to repair bone tissue, fat tissue, and connective tissue like cartilage.  These so-called factors that the cells produce are associated with those tissue growth functions and tissue repair functions,  Van Vliet says. Liu grows bone marrow-derived stem cells and studies how those stem cells release certain chemicals in response to mechanical interactions with materials in their surrounding environment.  I would like to manipulate the cells, using cell-material interactions, or synthetic materials, to produce certain chemicals beneficial to tissue repair,  Liu explains in the Laboratory for Material Chemomechanics at MIT.  Right now we are in the characterization phase, quantifying which and how much of different cytokines the cells secrete in response to different chemical and mechanical cues that we provide. Down the line, we aim to engineer those cytokine profiles using cell-material interactions.  Liu, 24, is a third-year PhD student and expects to complete her doctorate in 2017. She received her bachelor of science degree in biomedical engineering from Brown University. Liu is examining how various groups of stem cells differ in response to lab-controlled changes in their environment in ways that might be important for tissue repair in the body. ""Frances is determining the correlations between the mechanical properties of the materials the cells interact with and the chemical factors that they produce in response to that chemomechanical coupling,"" Van Vliet says. Heterogeneous cellular factories""You can think of the cells as factories; they're factories of chemicals,"" Van Vliet explains. ""One of the main ways you change the way that factory operates is you change the material properties of its environment. How stiff that environment is, how acidic that environment is, how rough that environment is, all of those characteristics of the cell's outside world can directly correlate with the chemicals that that cell produces. We don't really understand all of why that happens yet, but part of Frances' thesis is to understand these particular stem cells and the subpopulations within them."" While other researchers previously studied mechanical factors such as stiffness on the function of these mesenchymal (bone marrow-derived) stem cells, it wasn't widely recognized that they were examining a mixed population of cells, not a single well-defined cell population. ""Some of them were stem cells, but some were not,"" Van Vliet says. One way that Liu sorts her stem cells into groups is using an inertial microfluidic separation device that separates cells of large diameter cells from those of small diameter. This device was adapted from previous designs of their collaborator, MIT Professor Jongyoon Han, as part of the interdisciplinary team that Van Vliet leads within the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART). The group showed in a 2014 paper that three markers - size, mechanical stiffness, and how much the nucleus inside the cell moves around - are sufficient to identify stem cells in a heterogeneous population of chemically similar but non-stem cells. ""We measured those three properties as well as several other properties, but only those three properties together, that triplet of properties, distinguished a stem cell from a non-stem cell,"" Van Vliet says. By using the microfluidic device, we can better understand the differences between the subpopulations of these heterogeneous bone marrow cells and which cytokines each subpopulation may be secreting, both in the body and in the lab.","Published: March 24, 2015"

Metagenomics is the study of entire microbial communities using genomics, such as when you sequence the DNA of a whole community of organisms at once,  said Patrick Chain, the lead Los Alamos scientist on the project.  The result is an enormous data set of short sequences, or  reads,  that you need to sort through to try to understand which organisms are actually present, and what they may be doing. Here at Los Alamos, we specialize in incredibly large data sets, we know how to handle them whether it s for physics, ocean or climate modeling, or for complex biological insights.  We have developed a new tool in this rapidly expanding and evolving field of what is called  metagenomics .  said Chain,  it uses nucleic acid data and looks for sections that map uniquely to a preconstructed database.  In a paper this week in the journal Nucleic Acids Research,  Accurate read-based metagenome characterization using a hierarchical suite of unique signatures,  the researchers present this novel method for shotgun metagenomic read classification, a method that is highly accurate, and outperforms all other most recent methods, they say.  We believe this method will be a useful resource for analyzing metagenomic data, particularly in the area of diagnostics, where both high false-negative and false-positive rates cannot be tolerated, and where a profile of the relative abundance of certain organisms may be important,  said Chain. This method, or some version of it, is one step in the right direction toward ascertaining the presence of potential pathogens in a complex background, such as assessing medically relevant co-infections in clinical samples. The tool, named GOTTCHA (for Genomic Origins Through Taxonomic CHAllenge), makes use of a database of reference genomes that have been pre-processed to retain only unique segments of the genomes at any level of taxonomy, and then it classifies the individual metagenome sequences or  reads.  They have established a unique method to query these databases using any open access alignment software, and provide the presence and relative abundance profiles of the organisms found within a sample (community). This is the first effort that: 1) uses a wide array of synthetic, spiked and real datasets to both train and test the utility of a read-based community profiling method; 2) importantly, provides a series of defined and realistic (in amount and quality) metagenome datasets that can be used to re-validate any current or future tools; and 3) addresses the issue of false positives which hampers most other available software. The GOTTCHA tool provides the ability to find both bacterial and viral sequences within complex samples, and makes the method flexible to database search strategies such that it can be an enduring method of community profiling. The software and associated databases, as well as training datasets used within the manuscript are accessible at https://github.com/LANL-Bioinformatics/GOTTCHA.","Published: March 24, 2015"

The researchers, led by Professor Parry Guilford, show for the first time that the key genetic mutation underlying the devastating conditions also opens them to attack through drug therapies targeting other cellular mechanisms. There is currently no treatment for this kind of gastric cancer other than surgical removal of the stomach as a preventive measure in those identified as carrying the mutated gene. Lobular breast cancer is hard to detect by mammography and mastectomies are also undertaken by some carriers. The researchers  findings appear in the US journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics. The team used genomic screening to search for vulnerabilities in the cancer cells that lack the tumour-suppressor protein E-cadherin. The genetic mutation that causes this protein to be lost is common in hereditary diffuse gastric and lobular breast cancers. E-cadherin is not a traditional drug target for these forms of cancer because the protein is present in healthy cells but absent in malignant ones. However, Professor Guilford and his team predicted that its loss might create other vulnerabilities in these cancer cells. Professor Guilford says the research team used an approach of searching for  synthetically lethal  combinations of E-cadherin loss with inactivation of other proteins, which together cause cell death. After conducting a genome-wide functional screening of non-malignant human breast cells with, and without, E-cadherin loss, they identified a large number of such vulnerabilities that can be targeted by existing drug compounds. PhD student and study lead author Bryony Telford says further analysis showed that the most promising avenues of attack were against G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling proteins and those involved in maintaining the cell cytoskeleton.  We found that GPCR proteins were strikingly abundant in cells lacking E-cadherin, as were diverse types of cytoskeletal proteins,  Ms Telford says. Next, the researchers screened selected drug classes known to interfere with these proteins, and found that the E-cadherin-lacking cells proved highly sensitive to many of the compounds while their normal counterparts did not. Professor Guilford says that the synthetic lethal effects identified are highly promising for developing early chemoprevention treatments for people who carry the E-cadherin mutation and as a result are at high risk of gastric and lobular breast cancers.  Making such drug treatments a reality would mean delaying or completely avoiding the trauma that high-risk individuals experience by undergoing major preventive surgery at a young age,  he says. The study was undertaken in collaboration with researchers from Melbourne s Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and the University of Melbourne. The drugs were screened at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute s High-Throughput Chemical Screening Facility in that same city. Professor Guilford s work was supported by the Health Research Council of New Zealand. In the 1990s he began leading an ongoing collaboration with a large M ori family from the Bay of Plenty that identified E-cadherin as the first known gene for inherited gastric cancer. This allowed family members to be tested for the gene and to decide whether to take preventative action. This research was originally published in the leading journal Nature in 1998 and the findings have now led to hundreds of lives being saved around the world. Kimihauora Trust Manager Maybelle McLeod, who originally contacted the University and Professor Guilford to seek help in discovering the cause of the disease ravaging her family, says the findings are very exciting.  The only choice at the moment for those of us at genetic risk is to undergo drastic surgery, and having your stomach removed is a hard thing to bite. This latest research holds out a new hope for a gentler way to save the lives of our affected whanau members,  Ms McLeod says.","Published: March 24, 2015"

Now, a new study shows that individuals with the disorder exhibit different patterns of brain connectivity, when compared to typically developing (TD) individuals and that these patterns adjust as the individual ages.

Many epilepsy patients can control their symptoms through medication, but about 30% suffer from intractable epilepsy and are unable to manage the disease with drugs. Intractable epilepsy causes multiple seizures, permanent mental, physical, and developmental disabilities, and even death. Therefore, surgical removal of the affected area from the brain has been used as a treatment for patients with medically refractory seizures, but this too fails to provide a complete solution because only 60% of the patients who undergo surgery are rendered free of seizures. A Korean research team led by Professor Jeong Ho Lee of the Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Professor Dong-Seok Kim of the Epilepsy Research Center at Yonsei University College of Medicine has recently identified brain somatic mutations in the gene of mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) as the cause of focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII), one of the most important and common inducers to intractable epilepsy, particularly in children. They propose a targeted therapy to lessen epileptic seizures by suppressing the activation of mTOR kinase, a signaling protein in the brain. Their research results are published online in Nature Medicine. FCDII contributes to abnormal developments of the cerebral cortex, ranging from cortical disruption to severe forms of cortical dyslamination, balloon cells, and dysplastic neurons. The research team studied 77 FCDII patients with intractable epilepsy who had received surgery to remove the affected regions from the brain. The researchers used various deep sequencing technologies to conduct comparative DNA analysis of the samples obtained from the patients' saliva or brain and blood. They reported that about 16% of the studied patients had somatic mutations in their brain. Such mutations, however, did not take place in their blood or saliva DNA. Professor Jeong Ho Lee of KAIST said, ""This is an important finding. Unlike our previous belief that genetic mutations causing intractable epilepsy exist anywhere in the human body including the blood, specific gene mutations incurred only in the brain can lead to intractable epilepsy. From our animal model, we could see how a small fraction of mutations carrying neurons in the brain could affect its entire function."" The research team recapitulated the pathogenesis of intractable epilepsy by inducing the focal cortical expression of mutated mTOR in the mouse brain via an electroporation method and observed as the mouse developed epileptic symptoms. They then treated these mice with a drug called ""rapamycin"" to inhibit the activity of mTOR protein and observed that it suppressed the development of epileptic seizures with cytomegalic neurons. ""Our study offers the first evidence that brain-somatic-activating mutations in MTOR cause FCDII, and we identified mTOR as a treatment target for intractable epilepsy,"" said co-author Dr. Dong-Seok Kim, a neurosurgeon at Yonsei Medical Center with the most surgical experiences in treating patients with this condition.

The finding adds to growing evidence about the role of brain mechanisms in eating disorders and could lead to new treatment development efforts targeting specific brain pathways.    When most people are hungry, they are motivated to eat,  said Christina E. Wierenga, PhD, the study s first author and UC San Diego associate professor of psychiatry.  Yet individuals with anorexia can be hungry and still restrict their food intake. We wanted to identify brain mechanisms that may contribute to their ability to ignore rewards, like food.    Wierenga said their study showed differences in brain response to reward in women recovered from anorexia.  They showed decreased response to reward, even when hungry. This is opposite of healthy women without an eating disorder, who showed greater sensitivity to rewards when hungry,  added Wierenga.    The study is published in the current issue of the journal Biological Psychiatry. Walter H. Kaye, MD, a professor of psychiatry and director of the Eating Disorders Treatment and Research Program at UC San Diego and senior author, said the study s results further support the view that neurobiology contributes to this disorder.  Our study suggests that brain circuitry differences in anorexics make them less sensitive to reward and the motivational drive of hunger. Put another way, hunger does not motivate them to eat.  Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by abnormally low body weight, fear of gaining weight and a skewed perception of body image. Up to 24 million Americans are estimated to suffer from anorexia and other eating disorders, including bulimia and binge-eating disorder. Women are much more likely to develop eating disorders, which are associated with many medical problems and can be life-threatening.   In their study, the research team analyzed brain function in 23 women who had recovered from anorexia and a control group of 17 healthy women who had never had the disease. Individuals were studied who had previously had anorexia nervosa and were at normal weight, rather than those in an active disease phase, to avoid the potential of malnutrition confounding their research results. Researchers analyzed participants  brain circuitry related to motivation and reward during two distinct metabolic periods: when they were hungry and again when satiated. Along with differences in brain response to reward, Kaye said the researchers saw greater activity in regions of the brain important for self-control among the recovered anorexics, regardless of metabolic state. This suggests these individuals may possess a higher degree of self-control than people without eating disorders, he said.  We are using these new insights about brain mechanisms that contribute to disordered eating to guide the development of new treatment approaches in our Eating Disorders program at UC San Diego,  he said.  We re very motivated to help advance efforts to better understand and address this life-threatening disorder.  University of California, San Diego   Original reporting by: Bonnie Ward Christina E.

But in a few of these disorders, patients can be effectively treated with regimens such as prescription drugs, high doses of vitamin E and gluten-free diets, according to a review article in the journal Movement Disorders.  Clinicians must become familiar with these disorders, because maximal therapeutic benefit is only possible when done early. These uncommon conditions represent a unique opportunity to treat incurable and progressive diseases,  first author Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora, MD, co-author Jos  Biller, MD, and colleagues report. Dr. Ramirez-Zamora is an assistant professor of neurology and the Phyllis E. Dake Endowed Chair in Movement Disorders at Albany Medical Center Department of Neurology, and a former chief neurology resident at Loyola University Chicago. Dr. Biller is chair of the Department of Neurology of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. The word ataxia means without co-ordination. Ataxia symptoms include poor coordination, unsteady walk, difficulty speaking and swallowing, involuntary back-and-forth eye movements and difficulty performing fine-motor skills such as writing or buttoning a shirt. Hereditary ataxias are degenerative and progress over time. Ataxias usually are due to damage to the cerebellum, a part of the brain that controls muscle coordination.   Chronic cerebellar injury due to alcohol or other commonly used drugs such as lithium can be treated by discontinuing the offending drugs, the review article said. Below is a sampling of other effective treatments for cerebellar ataxias detailed in the review article: Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) impairs the body s ability to use vitamin E, resulting in ataxia and other debilitating symptoms. High doses of vitamin E (800 mg/d) typically stop disease progression and lead to neurological improvement   although recovery may be slow and incomplete.  The results of vitamin E supplementation also seem to be most beneficial if started in patients with less than 15 years of disease duration; the sooner after diagnosis the supplementation is begun, the better,  the article said. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is treated with chenodeoxycholic acid, which is made from naturally occurring bile acid. Beginning treatment early is crucial to preventing neurological deterioration. Gluten ataxia can be treated with a strict gluten-free diet.

""Using an in-depth analysis of one of these genes, we have already revealed an important relevant signaling pathway,"" says senior author Michael Granato, PhD, a professor of Cell and Developmental Biology. ""The proteins in this pathway could provide new insights into the development of novel pharmacological targets."" Over the last 20 years, zebrafish have become great models for studying development and disease. Like humans, zebrafish are vertebrates and over 80 percent of human genes bearing disease descriptions are also present in zebrafish. As such, this animal model has become increasingly popular to study human diseases such as cardiovascular conditions or tumor formation. Zebrafish have also become an ideal model for studying vertebrate neuroscience and behavior. In fact, Granato developed the first high-throughput behavioral assays that measure learning and memory in fish. ""Normal fish startle with changes in noise and light level by bending and swimming away from the annoying stimuli. They do eventually habituate and get used to the alterations in their environment,"" he explains. ""However, fish mutants fail to habituate -- they never get used to their surroundings and always flinch at the loud noises."" In nature, this startle response is important for avoiding predators, but is flexible in how the fish use it in different situations, notes first author Marc A. Wolman, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Granato lab who is now an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin. Past data from the Granato lab indicate that learning and memory defects are reversible with acute pharmacologic treatments and are therefore not hard-wired, as might be expected for a defect in the development of nerves. Habituation represents a fundamental form of learning, yet the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are not well defined. In humans, deficits in habituation are associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, Tourette's, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Years in the Making To find these genetic needles in the chromosome haystack, the team started four years ago by introducing small, ""point"" mutations into the zebrafish DNA. These are changes that affect only one or two DNA building blocks at a time. They then bred mutant fish for three generations to obtain fish whose genomes contain two copies of a mutant gene. These mutants were then exposed to the startle response test. Using a camera and software to eliminate human observer bias, they recorded how the mutants reacted to a loud noise. Most fish larvae habituated and stopped reacting to the noise stimulus. Some of the mutants, did, however, fail to habituate and continued to respond to the noise. A genome-wide genetic screen, coupled with whole genome sequencing, identified 14 different mutations in zebrafish that failed to habituate. One of these 14 contained a mutation in the vertebrate-specific gene pregnancy-associated plasma protein-aa (pappaa). This gene encodes an enzyme that cleaves other proteins and works outside the cell. It is known to increase the availability of the hormone IGF at the cell surface, thereby enhancing receptor signaling for the IGF pathway. (A role of the PAPPAA enzyme in or on neurons had not been described; however, IGF is known to be an important molecule in pathways that determine long-term memory.) ""At first we didn't think it was important in learning, but we found that pappaa is expressed by startle-circuit neurons,"" explains Granato. The team verified the involvement of the IGF pathway by rescuing mutant behavior to normal by adding an activator of downstream molecules that interact with the IGF receptor. Mutants that were treated this way, when put back in the startle test, reacted normally and habituated to the loud noise. Also, when the team used an inhibitor of the IGF receptor in normal zebrafish larvae, these fish showed the same behavior in the startle test as the pappaa mutants. This all indicates that the pappaa gene promotes learning by acutely and locally increasing IGF availability to the cell. ""Our experiments found the first functional gene set for habituation learning in a vertebrate and identify PAPPAA-regulated IGF signaling as a novel mechanism regulating this type of behavior,"" says Granato. ""A mammal pappaa gene exists but its function is as yet unknown. In future studies we hope to capitalize on the identification of pappaa and the other 13 genes we isolated to identify pharmacological treatments that enhance learning and memory.""

The research, which was funded by Alzheimer's Society and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), is published in The Journal of Cell Biology. Working with scientists at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and University of Puerto Rico, the researchers studied how synapses are affected by changes in the protein CHMP2B that are linked to frontotemporal dementia (FTD). They uncovered mechanisms that controlled growth in synapses causing them to overgrow. These signals are normally involved in immune reactions and have not been seen to function in synapse growth previously. Frontotemporal dementia is one of the most common forms of early onset dementia that typically starts in individuals in their fifties. It affects the ability to use and understand language in addition to a change in personality and a loss of inhibition in some social behaviours. This is caused by the loss of neurons in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. Initial laboratory research into the effects of CHMP2B was carried out using Drosophila (fruit flies), and findings were confirmed in mammalian neurons. This work identifies novel steps in disease progression that could potentially be targeted by drugs to halt cognitive decline. The senior author Dr Sean Sweeney, of the Department of Biology, University of York, said: ""These findings shed light on the events occurring in neurons as dementia takes hold. The more we know about the steps that occur in disease progression, the more opportunities we have to intervene with potential therapies.""

In an extensive opinion piece recently published online in Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs, Henry Ford Hospital researcher Ye Xiong, M.D., Ph.D., makes the case for pioneering work underway in Detroit, Michigan, and elsewhere seeking to understand and repair brain function at the molecular level. ""To date, all attempts at treating traumatic brain injury with experimental drugs have failed once testing moved from animal studies to clinical trials in humans,"" Dr. Xiong explains. ""Although this is disappointing, we believe innovations now at the preclinical stage hold great promise for a deeper understanding of traumatic brain injury and how to treat it."" TBI most commonly results from a sudden, violent blow to the head, in some cases driving broken bone into the brain, or from a bullet or other object piercing the skull and entering the brain. This trauma sets off a complex ""cascade"" of reactions in the brain that can impair thinking and reasoning, behavior and movement. Each year, at least 10 million TBIs that are serious enough to result in hospitalization or death occur around the world. Most attempts at treatment have targeted the physical damage with drugs aimed at protecting neurons from further damage. But while such attempts have shown promise in animal studies, they've all failed to help human patients. Over the past three decades, more than 30 such clinical trials have ended in failure. More recently, evidence has been amassed by researchers showing that the human brain has ""a significant, albeit limited"" ability to repair itself both physically and functionally, including: The new approach to TBI therapy described by Dr. Xiong aims at enhancing these restorative, or ""neuroplastic,"" processes as they work together to improve neurological recovery. ""Significant advances in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying TBI's behavioral, cognitive or psychiatric effects have been made, and the use of cell-based and pharmacological interventions to improve symptoms, function and outcome is still under development,"" Dr. Xiong explains. Among interventional drugs now in early clinical trials are: Other promising investigational biologics and drugs that are now in promising preclinical development at Henry Ford include thymosin beta 4, exosomes recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator and microRNAs. ""Although it is still important to further investigate neuroprotective treatments for TBI, these novel, neurorestorative or neuroplastic approaches will facilitate development of treatments for TBI with the ultimate goal of reducing brain injury, promoting brain repair and remodeling, and eventually improving functional recovery and quality of life,"" Dr. Xiong concludes.

The association also runs in the other direction, with migraine patients having higher odds of carpal tunnel syndrome, according to research by Dr. Huay-Zong Law and colleagues of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. The findings add a new piece of evidence in the ongoing debate over the use of nerve decompression surgery as a treatment for migraine headaches. The researchers analyzed data from nearly 26,000 Americans responding to a national health survey. Among other questions, participants were asked whether they had had carpal tunnel syndrome during the past year or ""severe headache or migraine"" during the past three months. Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome have symptoms such as hand numbness and weakness, resulting from pressure on the median nerve in the wrist. Based on these definitions, 3.7 percent of respondents had carpal tunnel syndrome and 16.3 percent had migraine headache. Associations between these two conditions were analyzed, with adjustment for patient- and health-related risk factors. The results suggested that people with migraine were more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome, and vice versa. Migraine was present in 34 percent of respondents with CTS, compared to 16 percent of those without CTS. After adjustment for other factors, the odds of having migraine were 2.6 times higher for those with CTS. Carpal tunnel syndrome was present in eight percent of participants with migraine versus three percent of those without migraine. On adjusted analysis, the odds of having CTS were about 2.7 times higher for those with migraine. The two conditions had some shared risk factors -- especially female sex, obesity, diabetes, and smoking. Carpal tunnel syndrome was associated with older age and migraine with younger age. Both conditions were less common in Asians, and CTS was less common in Hispanics. The associations between CTS and migraine were independent of all of these factors. Both CTS and migraines are common conditions with high costs and disability. The contributing causes of both conditions are ""poorly understood."" Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common of a group of related conditions called compression neuropathies, with symptoms related to pressure on nerves. Historically, migraine has not been considered to be a compression neuropathy. Dr. Law and colleagues write, ""Recently, however, there is some evidence that migraine headache may be triggered by nerve compression in the head and neck, with some patients responding to nerve decompression by surgical release."" Some studies have reported improvement in migraine headaches after surgery to relieve pressure on nerves at specific migraine ""trigger points."" However, this concept remains ""controversial"" and ""heavily debated,"" according to the authors. The new study is the first to show an association between CTS and migraine. The nature of the connection remains unclear -- the two conditions may share some ""common systemic or neurologic risk factor,"" the researchers write. Noting that migraine tends to occur at younger ages and CTS at older ages, Dr. Law and coauthors call for further studies to determine whether migraine headache may be an ""early indicator"" of patients who are more likely to develop CTS in the future. If so, such a connection ""would allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment, or even prevention, of CTS by modification of risk factors,"" they conclude.

TB is spread by inhaling tiny airborne droplets from an infected person. The bacteria can survive in the lungs for long periods without causing symptoms   known as latent infection. Most infections can be treated with antibiotics, but some forms of TB are resistant to drugs. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, which is resistant to at least two of the main treatments, has become more common in the UK, increasing from 28 cases per year in 2000 to 81 in 2012.  Multi-drug resistant TB is a real problem in the UK,  said Dr Graham Cooke, lead author of the study, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London.  It takes a lot of time, effort and resources to treat, and treatment is less successful.  This sort of analysis will help to improve our understanding of how diseases spread and identify more effective ways to stop them. In 2010, the Health Protection Agency (now Public Health England) began performing genetic tests on samples of TB bacteria to help identify links between patients and better understand how infections are passed on. In an article published in Emerging Infectious Diseases today, researchers report using this genetic information to trace the source of infection in a British patient who had never travelled abroad. The DNA profile of the bacteria sample was matched to that of a patient who died in 2008. The second patient had worked as a healthcare worker at Tugela Ferry Hospital in South Africa, the location of a serious outbreak of drug-resistant TB in 2005, but was healthy upon moving to the UK to work. Admission records established that both patients were admitted on the same medical ward in a UK hospital for eight days in 2008. As is typical with TB, the infection didn t manifest itself in the second patient until four years later, when he was admitted to hospital and ultimately succumbed to the infection.  Genetic sequencing enabled us to establish beyond reasonable doubt that a patient who died of multidrug-resistant TB caught the infection from another patient at a hospital in the UK,  said Dr Cooke.  Genome sequencing of pathogens is becoming part of routine practice for establishing transmission patterns for TB and other infectious diseases. This sort of analysis will help to improve our understanding of how diseases spread and identify more effective ways to stop them.  In this case, the infection was traced to a healthcare worker. At a time when Ebola is in the news this reminds us that healthcare workers are vulnerable to many infections and, if not diagnosed, have a high risk of passing them on.  The study was supported in part by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Imperial Biomedical Research Centre, the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU) in Healthcare Associated Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance and the NIHR HPRU in Respiratory Infections, both at Imperial College London in partnership with Public Health England. Professor Alison Holmes, Director of the NIHR HPRU in Healthcare Associated Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance at Imperial College London, said:  The work of Dr Cooke and colleagues reinforces the fact that effective infection prevention measures are critical for protecting the lives of patients and healthcare workers globally. The paper illustrates the importance of genetic profiling in identifying and pinpointing transmission and investigating outbreaks. The development of more rapid diagnostics and molecular epidemiology will be invaluable in addressing the spread of infection and drug resistance. ","Published: March 23, 2015"

It has been developed by researchers at UQ s Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) and the School of Agriculture and Food Sciences. AIBN s Professor Matt Trau said the test detected viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites in humans, crops and cattle and could be used by health workers or farmers in the field   saving lives, time and money.    We ve been able to take what would usually be done with complicated equipment in a centralised laboratory and miniaturise it into a single drop of fluid that farmers, for example, can use to get an almost immediate result in the field,  Professor Trau said. The test uses a single drop of liquid that changes colour if the test is positive. In its current form, the test can be made sensitive enough to detect even the smallest trace amounts of DNA or RNA, and it can also scan for multiple pathogens (bacteria, viruses and other micro-organisms that cause disease) or cancer markers.   We can now detect as little as just a few molecules of DNA in almost any sample such as blood, saliva, or even soil.  This part is particularly exciting for many future applications,  Professor Trau said. The test has already proved accurate in detecting human diseases such as HIV, malaria, tuberculosis the H1N1 influenza virus, as well as E. coli in water, bovine herpes virus in cattle, and fusarium fungus in crops.  UQ School of Agriculture and Food Sciences Professor Jimmy Botella said there were virtually no limits for potential uses for the technology.  This new test is especially suited for developing countries, but it will also be very useful for the Australian agricultural and livestock industries as it provides a fast method to detect diseases without the need to send samples to the laboratory,  he said.  We expect that the technology would also be beneficial to the Australian Customs and Quarantine services and the Australian export industry as they could test produce in the packinghouse before shipping. The technology will soon be trialled in Cambodia to test for food pathogens, in a project led by Professor Botella with support from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR).

""This is a real game changer,"" says Professor John Fraser (Dean of the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences at the University of Auckland), who was speaking at the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases (ASID) Annual Scientific Meeting in Auckland this week. Rheumatic fever is caused by infection with group A streptococcus (GAS).  Recurrent infections cause chronic damage to the heart valves known as rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The GAS bacterium also causes serious bloodstream infections and flesh eating disease, kidney disease as well as sore throats and skin sores. This causes more than half a million deaths each year around the world. In New Zealand, Pacific Islanders and Maori people are disproportionately at risk. For 80 years now scientists have been trying to develop a vaccine, but the combination of lack of profitability (it's the world's youngest and poorest that are most affected), the challenge of tackling a wide variety of strains, and the risks associated with trials have made the pharmaceutical industry reluctant to drive this forward. But now a new initiative funded by the Australian and New Zealand governments known as CANVAS (Coalition to Advance New Vaccines for Group A Streptococcus) is finally making progress. ""This is the most confident I've felt yet that a vaccine is within reach,  says Professor Fraser who is also CANVAS co-Principal Investigator.  We have the capacity. We have the will of the international community, and we have the funding of two governments to see this through. In as little as three years I think we might have a vaccine in late-stage trials.  New Zealand has been at the forefront of efforts to tackle rheumatic fever with significant investments in public health initiatives and more recently a commitment to develop a group A streptococcus vaccine. Both Australia and New Zealand are investing more than any other country in the world into this commitment.  CANVAS - a collaboration between the University of Western Australia affiliated Telethon Kids Institute and the University of Auckland - plans to assess several vaccines candidates and fast track development of a vaccine most likely to be safe, efficacious and cost effective. CANVAS has three goals in its first stage: (i) Identify the most common disease strains; (ii) evaluate which vaccines currently under development best target these and (iii) make the financial case for the development of the most effective vaccine.  Subsequent stages will accelerate development of the best candidate, through government funding and global partnerships. The CANVAS team has been working with scientists from around the world and has now identified three to four vaccines with promise, from which the strongest will be selected for development. This selection could happen as soon as December this year.  ""This new era has resulted in wonderful collaborations on a global scale,  says Professor Fraser.  Efforts to develop rheumatic fever vaccines have involved researchers from countries such as the United States, Italy, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand collaborating with researchers in Mali, Nicaragua, Fiji, India, and South Africa.  This truly global effort is getting results. I feel confident we will see a vaccine soon.  Funding for CANVAS is provided through the National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia and the Health Research Council of New Zealand.","Published: March 23, 2015"

These data were presented at the 12th International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases and Related Neurological Disorders in Nice, France. Treatment with aducanumab produced a dose- and time-dependent reduction of amyloid plaque in the brain, which is believed to play a key role in the development of the symptoms of AD. In exploratory analyses, a dose-dependent, statistically significant effect of slowing clinical decline was observed on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scales. PRIME is an ongoing Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study evaluating safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of aducanumab in patients with prodromal or mild AD. This interim analysis of PRIME reflects data for 166 patients, up to week 54 in the placebo (n=40), 1 mg/kg (n=31), 3 mg/kg (n=33), 10 mg/kg (n=32) dosing arms and at least week 30 data for 6 mg/kg (n=30) dosing arm. In patients receiving aducanumab, a dose- and time-dependent reduction of amyloid plaque was observed over 54 weeks of treatment. Aducanumab treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction of amyloid plaque in the 3 mg/kg [average change of -0.087, p<0.01)], 6 mg/kg [-0.143 (p<0.001)], and 10 mg/kg [-0.205 (p<0.001)] dose arms compared to placebo at 26 weeks. Amyloid plaque levels were reduced by -0.030 in the 1 mg/kg arm, which was not significant. At week 54, a statistically significant reduction of amyloid plaque was observed in the 3 mg/kg [-0.139 (p<0.001)] and 10 mg/kg [-0.266 (p<0.001)] dose arms. The reduction of amyloid plaque in the 1 mg/kg (-0.056) arm was not significant. The 6 mg/kg arm is ongoing and the week 54 data will become available at a later date. Results from the MMSE and CDR indicated a slowing of cognitive decline associated with aducanumab treatment. On the MMSE, patients in the placebo group worsened by an average of 3.14 at one year, whereas the decline was 2.21 in the 1 mg/kg arm, 0.75 in the 3 mg/kg arm, and 0.58 in the 10 mg/kg arm. Relative to placebo, the 3 mg/kg and the 10 mg/kg demonstrated a statistically significant slowing of cognitive decline on the MMSE both with p-values <0.05. On the CDR-SB, patients in the placebo group worsened by an average of 2.04 at one year. In comparison the worsening was 1.70 in the 1 mg/kg arm, 1.33 in the 3 mg/kg arm and 0.59 in the 10 mg/kg group. Relative to placebo, the 10 mg/kg showed a statistically significant slowing of cognitive decline on the CDR-SB with p value <0.05. Aducanumab demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in this analysis. The most frequently reported treatment-related serious adverse event (SAE) and adverse event (AE) was ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities). Based on MRI scans, the incidence of ARIA-E (edema) was dose- and apolipoprotein E-e4-(ApoE4) status-dependent. ApoE4 is a gene associated with a higher risk of developing AD. In ApoE4 carriers incidence of ARIA-E was reported in five percent of patients in the 1 and 3 mg/kg arms, 43 percent in the 6 mg/kg arm and 55 percent in the 10 mg/kg arm. In ApoE4 non-carriers, ARIA-E was seen in nine percent, 11 percent and 17 percent of patients in the 3, 6 and 10 mg/kg aducanumab arms, respectively; no cases were reported in the 1 mg/kg arm. In general, the onset of ARIA-E was observed early in the course of treatment and was asymptomatic or with mild, transient symptoms. The majority of patients with ARIA-E were able to resume treatment at a lower dose once the ARIA-E resolved. Headache occurred in 22 percent of subjects receiving aducanumab compared to five percent in the placebo groups and appeared to be dose-dependent. Three deaths were reported in the time period of this analysis, two in the placebo group and one in the 10 mg/kg study arm; none were considered to be treatment related. Other AEs and SAEs were consistent with what is typically observed in the study population.  We are pleased about the consistent nature of the Phase 1b interim data obtained with aducanumab that originated from Neurimmune s RTM technology platform,  said Roger Nitsch, co-founder and President of Neurimmune.  The dose- and time-dependent reductions on brain amyloid levels in addition to the slowed cognitive decline and an acceptable safety profile are encouraging results for aducanumab. We are looking forward to the planned Phase 3 clinical trials. ","Published: March 21, 2015"

Disruptions in the regulation of the direction or speed of the water flow are associated with medical conditions, including hydrocephalus (""water in the brain""), for example. Neurobiologists at Heidelberg University have now discovered a new mechanism that regulates the speed and direction of water flow between the cerebral spinal fluid and the brain cells. This mechanism could also be of great importance in the treatment of hydrocephalic diseases. The research results were published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. ""Both too much and too little water in the brain can be life-threatening. Water transport is essential to sustain brain volume and function because it affects the concentration of signal molecules in the brain,"" explains Dr. Francesca Ciccolini, who leads a research group at the Interdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences. The water circulates among the blood vessels, the cerebral spinal fluid in the ventricular system, and the space inside and outside the brain cells. It follows the osmotic gradient, composed mainly of ions such as chloride ions. The speed of flow is largely influenced by the presence of water channels in the cell membrane called aquaporin channel proteins (AQPs), that are built into the cell membrane as needed. In general, phosphorylation, i.e. the addition of a phosphate group, of AQP channel proteins causes their removal from the cell membrane and hence reduced water in- and outflow. Francesca Ciccolini's research group has now discovered the mechanism that controls the integration of a certain AQP channel protein in so-called ependymal brain cells, which act as a barrier between the brain and the ventricular system. This mechanism regulates the speed of water flow between the cerebral spinal fluid and the brain cells. The neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the GABAA receptors play a critical role in this mechanism. ""The GABAA receptors are extremely important in medicine in their biological function as inhibitory regulators of neuronal activity,"" explains Francesca Ciccolini. ""Modulators of GABAA receptors are commonly used as medications in a broad spectrum of medical treatments, for example to induce sedation and muscle relaxation, to prevent seizures, to reduce anxiety and to counteract symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Hence our results also point to the risk of therapies that involve the use of GABAA receptor modulators and thus have potential side effects on the basic regulation of water exchange within the brain."" The researchers additionally proved that the newly discovered mechanism is important for removing excess fluid from the cerebral spinal space and can therefore play a significant role in the treatment of hydrocephalic diseases. ""Our findings offer up new possibilities for regulating the water content in the human brain,"" explains Ciccolini.

Their work, published this month in Neurology, may suggest a neuroprotective target for drug discovery efforts. ""This is the first epigenetic modification of a gene that seems to be protective against neuronal disease,"" says lead author Corey McMillan, PhD, research assistant professor of Neurology in the Frontotemporal Degeneration Center in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). Expansions in the offending gene, C9orf72, have been linked with TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) which is the pathological source that causes ALS and FTD. ""Understanding the role of C9orf72 has the possibility to be truly translational and improve the lives of patients suffering from these devastating diseases,"" says senior author, Edward Lee, MD, PhD, assistant professor of Neuropathology in Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Penn. McMillan and team evaluated 20 patients recruited from both the FTD Center and the ALS Center at the University of Pennsylvania who screened positive for a mutation in the C9orf72 gene and were clinically diagnosed with FTD or ALS. All patients completed a neuroimaging study, a blood test to evaluate C9orf72 methylation levels, and a brief neuropsychological screening assessment. The study also included 25 heathy controls with no history of neurological or psychiatric disease. MRI revealed reduced gray matter in several regions that were affected in patients compared to controls. Gray matter is needed for the proper function of the brain in regions involved with muscle control, memory, emotions, speech and decision-making. Critically, patients with hypermethylation of C9orf72 showed more dense gray matter in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and thalamus, regions of the brain important for the above described tasks and affected in ALS and FTD, suggesting that hypermethylation is neuroprotective in these regions. To validate these findings, the Penn team also looked at autopsies of 35 patients with C9orf72 expansions and found that their pathology also suggested that increased methylation was associated with reduced neuronal loss in both the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Longitudinal analysis was performed in 11 of the study patients to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of hypermethylation in individuals over their disease course. This showed reduced changes in gray matter of the hippocampus, thalamus, and frontal cortex, associated with hypermethlation suggesting that disease progresses more slowly over time in individuals with C9orf72 hypermethylation. Longitudinal neuropsychological assessments also showed a correlation between protected memory decline and hypermethylation. These findings are consistent with a growing number of studies which have suggested the neuroprotective effects of the hypermethylation of C9orf72. ""We believe that this work provides additional data supporting the notion that C9orf72 methylation is neuroprotective and therefore opens up the exciting possibility of a new avenue for precision medicine treatments and targets for drug development in neurodegenerative disease,"" says McMillan.

The U.S. government Department of Defense-funded study, ""Olfactory impairment and traumatic brain injury in blast-injured combat troops: a cohort study,"" led by Air Force Colonel (Dr.) Michael Xydakis, associate professor of Surgery in the F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), and his colleagues from USU, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and the National Institutes of Health, found that testing the sense of smell can be used to assess memory impairment following trauma. The team, which included Navy Captain (Dr.) Lisa P. Mulligan, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Department of Neurosurgery; Lt Col (Dr.) Alice B. Smith, Cara H. Olsen, DrPH, and Dina M. Lyon, RN, from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and Leonardo Belluscio, Ph.D., National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, studied more than 231 acutely injured polytrauma inpatients at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center who had been air-evacuated from the combat zone in Afghanistan or Iraq. Each soldier was evaluated for traumatic brain injury and then administered a test of their sense of smell using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. The olfactory system processes thousands of different odors, sending signals to the brain which interprets the smell by linking it to a past memory. If memory is impaired, as is the case with Alzheimer's disease, sleep deprivation, and acute traumatic brain injury, the task is not entirely possible. When the smell test was abnormal in a subject, those soldiers were all found to have abnormalities on their brain scans. ""Although it may seem far-fetched that the sense of smell can be used to identify a concealed brain injury, olfactory impairment was commonly used by neurosurgeons in attempts to localize certain brain tumors prior to the use of advanced neuroimaging in the 1980s,"" said Xydakis. The investigators then concluded that this kind of methodology could be used in the combat theater to assist deployed physicians in determining which injured troops would require immediate neuroimaging, thus significantly enhancing frontline neurologic combat casualty care. ""Getting a CT scan in a combat zone is often the equivalent distance of placing a soldier on a helicopter in Washington, D.C., and sending them to Boston. It requires a significant investment in personnel and aviation resources; not to mention flying troops over hostile terrain. Using abnormalities with the sensory systems has opened up an entirely new avenue of investigation for diagnosing brain injuries,"" Xydakis said.

But although the mechanisms that spur the destruction of neurons in Alzheimer's disease are not yet fully understood, two well-documented signs of the condition are accumulation of the amyloid-  peptide (the main component of plaques found in Alzheimer's patient brains) and chronic inflammation. New research from Rockefeller University, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, identifies a bridge between the two. That bridge, a molecular cascade known as the contact system, may provide opportunities for early diagnosis of the disease through simple blood tests. ""People have been looking for a long time for markers for Alzheimer's disease,"" says Sidney Strickland, head of the Patricia and John Rosenwald Laboratory of Neurobiology and Genetics. But current diagnostic tests for pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's leave much to be desired. Evaluating the level of amyloid-  in the cerebral spinal fluid, for instance, requires an invasive spinal tap procedure. ""Finding a blood biomarker that would let us know through a simple test whether someone is on their way to developing the disease would be a significant advance,"" says first author Daria Zamolodchikov, a postdoctoral associate in the Strickland lab. The new study grew from the lab's ongoing work that looks at how the vascular system is involved in Alzheimer's disease. It has been shown that amyloid-  can activate a protein in plasma called factor XII, the first step in a pathway known as the contact system. When activated, this system leads to the release of a small peptide called bradykinin, a molecule known to promote potentially damaging inflammation. Although some studies have found these molecules in the cerebral spinal fluid and brain tissue of Alzheimer's patients, no one had studied them in Alzheimer's patient plasma. Using plasma from people with and without diagnosed Alzheimer's disease, the researchers measured the activation levels of the contact system. They found increased activation of this system in the plasma of Alzheimer's patients, potentially implicating it in the inflammatory pathology of the disease. Moreover, in a subset of patients whose amyloid-  levels in the cerebral spinal fluid were known, the researchers demonstrated a positive correlation between activation of the contact system and changes in cerebral spinal fluid amyloid-  levels, which as mentioned above are correlated with the development of Alzheimer's. The researchers found similar activation of the contact system in mouse models of Alzheimer's, which are genetically modified to overproduce amyloid- . They then conducted a follow-up experiment with healthy mice. ""We went one step further and took completely normal wild-type mice and injected them with amyloid- . We found that on its own, injection with amyloid-  can activate this system. It's a proof of principle in a complex environment,"" says Zamolodchikov. These findings will need to be supported by studies in larger patient populations and longitudinal studies, but they could eventually open the door to diagnosis of pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's based on blood levels of these molecules. The contact system may also offer a new approach to therapies for Alzheimer's disease, since inhibition of the pathway could blunt some of the inflammatory aspects of the disease. One concern is that the contact system is also involved in blood clotting and inhibition might carry a risk of bleeding. However, people with a defect in this system do not have hemophilia. Thus, inhibition of this pathway might slow progression of the disease without increasing the risk of hemorrhage.

The study, which was coordinated by graduate research student Sara Studte, involved examination of memory recall in 41 participants. The volunteers had to learn single words and word pairs. Once the learning phase was over, the participants were tested to determine how much information they could remember. About half of the participants were then allowed to sleep, while the others watched a DVD. After that, the participants were re-tested and those who had taken a nap were shown to have retained substantially more word pairs in memory than the participants in the control group who had watched a DVD. The results of the study have been published in the journal Neurobiology of Learning and Memory. Generations of school students have gone to bed the night before a math exam or a vocabulary test with their algebra book or vocabulary notes tucked under their pillow in the hope that the knowledge would somehow be magically transferred into their brains while they slept. That they were not completely taken in by a superstitious belief has now been demonstrated by a team of neuropsychologists at Saarland University, who have shown that even a brief sleep can significantly improve retention of learned material in memory. Sara Studte, a graduate biologist specializing in neuropsychology, working with her PhD supervisor Axel Mecklinger and co-researcher Emma Bridger, is examining how power naps influence memory performance. The results are clear: ""Even a short sleep lasting 45 to 60 minutes produces a five-fold improvement in information retrieval from memory,"" explains Axel Mecklinger. Strictly speaking, memory performance did not improve in the nap group relative to the levels measured immediately after the learning phase, but they did remain constant.  The control group, whose members watched DVDs while the other group slept, performed significantly worse than the nap group when it came to remembering the word pairs. The memory performance of the participants who had a power nap was just as good as it was before sleeping, that is, immediately after completing the learning phase, says Professor Mecklinger. The researchers were particularly focused on the role of the hippocampus   a region of the brain in which memories are  consolidated    the process by which previously learned information is transferred into long-term memory storage.  We examined a particular type of brain activity, known as  sleep spindles , that plays an important role in memory consolidation during sleep,  explains Sara Studte. A sleep spindle is a short burst of rapid oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG).  We suspect that certain types of memory content, particularly information that was previously tagged, is preferentially consolidated during this type of brain activity,  says Mecklinger. Newly learned information is effectively given a label, making it easier to recall that information at some later time. In short, a person s memory of something is stronger, the greater the number of sleep spindles appearing in the EEG. In order to exclude the possibility that the participants only recall the learned items due to a feeling of familiarity, the researchers used the following trick: the test subjects were required to learn not only 90 single words, but also 120 word pairs, where the word pairs were essentially meaningless. Axel Mecklinger explains the method:  A word pair might, for example, be  milk-taxi . Familiarity is of no use here when participants try to remember this word pair, because they have never heard this particular word combination before and it is essentially without meaning. They therefore need to access the specific memory of the corresponding episode in the hippocampus.  The research teams draws a clear conclusion from its study:  A short nap at the office or in school is enough to significantly improve learning success. Wherever people are in a learning environment, we should think seriously about the positive effects of sleep,  says Axel Mecklinger. Enhancing information recall through sleeping doesn t require us to stuff bulky tomes under our pillow. A concentrated period of learning followed by a short relaxing sleep is all that s needed.

Developed by researchers at the University of Warwick, the methodology, called Brain-Wide Association Analysis (BWAS), is the first capable of creating panoramic views of the whole brain and provides scientists with an accurate 3D model to study. The researchers used BWAS to identify regions of the brain that may make a major contribution to the symptoms of autism. BWAS does so by analyzing 1,134,570,430 individual pieces of data; covering the 47,636 different areas of the brain, called voxels, which comprise a functional MRI (fMRI) scan and the connections between them. Previous methodologies were process this level of data and were restricted to modeling only limited areas. The ability to analyze the entire data set from an fMRI scan provided the Warwick researchers the opportunity to compile, compare and contrast accurate computer models for both autistic and non-autistic brains. Led by BWAS developer Professor Jianfeng Feng, from the University of Warwick's Department of Computer Science, the researchers collected the data from hundreds of fMRI scans of autistic and non-autistic brains. By comparing the two subsequent models the researchers isolated twenty examples of difference, where the connections between voxels of the autistic brain were stronger or weaker than the non-autistic . The identified differences include key systems involved with brain functions relating to autism. Professor Feng explained the findings: ""We identified in the autistic model a key system in the temporal lobe visual cortex with reduced cortical functional connectivity. This region is involved with the face expression processing involved in social behavior. This key system has reduced functional connectivity with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which is implicated in emotion and social communication."" The researchers also identified in autism a second key system relating to reduced cortical functional connectivity, a part of the parietal lobe implicated in spatial functions. They propose that these two types of functionality, face expression-related, and of one's self and the environment, are important components of the computations involved in theory of mind, whether of oneself or of others, and that reduced connectivity within and between these regions may make a major contribution to the symptoms of autism. The researchers argue that the methodology can potentially isolate the areas of the brain involved with other cognitive problems, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, ADHD and schizophrenia. By using meta-analysis and a rigorous statistics approach the Warwick researchers were able to collect and use a big data set to obtain significant results, the likes of which have not been seen in autistic literature before. Professor Feng explains: ""We used BWAS to analyze resting state fMRI data collected from 523 autistic people and 452 controls. The amount of data analysed helped to achieve the sufficient statistical power necessary for this first voxel-based, comparison of whole autistic and non-autistic brains. Until the development of BWAS this had not been possible. ""BWAS tests for differences between patients and controls in the connectivity of every pair of voxels at a whole brain level. Unlike previous seed-based or independent components-based approaches, this method has the great advantage of being fully unbiased in that the connectivity of all brain voxels can be compared, not just selected brain regions.""

Around 2 per cent of all tumours have defects in CBLC. The study, which was carried out in collaboration with colleagues in Denmark and the Czech Republic, was funded in the UK by the European Union, and was published today in the journal Oncotarget. Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, became the first cancer drug targeted at an inherited genetic fault to reach the market when it was approved in December for use in ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Its development was underpinned by research at the ICR. Using an approach known as RNA interference screening   which  silences  genes to analyse their function   researchers systematically tested which of the 25,000 genes in the human genome affected the response of cancer cells to olaparib. The ICR team found that cancer cells with a defect in the CBLC gene were as sensitive to the drug as those with a faulty BRCA2 gene. By analysing the molecular processes that the CBLC gene controls, researchers found that it normally allows cells to repair damaged DNA by fixing broken DNA strands back together. This finding indicates that a flaw in DNA repair mechanisms explains the sensitivity of CBLC-defective cancer cells to PARP inhibitors   which knock out the action of another DNA repair mechanism. DNA repair is often disrupted in cancer cells, which sacrifice genetic stability as they gain mutations that allow them to divide uncontrollably. These cancer cells may be particularly vulnerable to drugs to block DNA repair proteins, since they may lack any alternative functioning repair systems to fall back on. Study co-leader Dr Chris Lord, Team Leader in Gene Function at the ICR, said:  Our study has found that defects in a rather poorly studied DNA repair gene called CBLC seem to greatly increase sensitivity to olaparib, a PARP inhibitor which is currently licensed only for BRCA-mutated cancer.  PARP inhibitors are an exciting new class of cancer drug. Understanding why different types of tumour cells respond to PARP inhibitors will play a critical part in making sure these new drugs are used in the most effective way.  Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of the ICR, said:  The development of PARP inhibitors is a UK success story, with collaboration between ICR academics, companies, charities and the NHS leading to trials in BRCA-mutated cancers and the licensing of olaparib only a few months ago.  This new study adds to evidence that PARP inhibitors can be effective in a broader group of patients than those with BRCA mutations, and could lead to them being used more widely in patients with other kinds of faults in DNA repair.

According to a new study published in Nature, researchers have found a way to enhance the effects of this therapeutic approach in glioblastoma, a deadly type of brain cancer, and possibly improve patient outcomes. The research was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) as well as the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which are part of the National Institutes of Health.  The promise of dendritic cell-based therapy and other immunotherapies for brain cancer has been upheld for some time, but an important implication of this work is a demonstrated capacity to significantly improve the clinical impact of immunotherapy for patients with this very difficult disease,  said Duane A. Mitchell, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program at the University of Florida in Gainesville and co-lead author of the study. Dendritic cells are specialized immune cells that normally capture microorganisms, and then migrate to the lymph nodes to prepare other immune players, such as T cells, to fight off the invaders. Dendritic cells have been used for immunotherapy to target a variety of tumor types, including those that affect the brain. These cells are taken from the patient, engineered to express antigens from the tumor  to create a vaccine, and then injected back into the patient. Once in the patient, the engineered dendritic cells activate T cells, which can fight the tumor and also prevent it from coming back, via an immune memory response. Dr. Mitchell and his colleagues wanted to know if increasing dendritic cell migration to lymph nodes would improve the effects of the vaccine. To test this idea, a group of glioblastoma patients was randomized to receive a tetanus booster shot before getting the tumor-antigen expressing dendritic cell vaccine. The booster was designed to set off an inflammatory response at the site of the vaccination, prepping the immune system for a larger battle. The other group of patients were injected with their own native dendritic cells instead of a tetanus shot, and then treated with the tumor-antigen expressing dendritic cell vaccine. Both sets of patients were treated with the vaccine which was being tested for effectiveness against glioblastoma. The vaccine used in this study was targeted against cytomegalovirus (CMV). Studies have shown that CMV is found in glioblastoma tumors, but it is unclear if the virus causes tumors or contributes to disease progression. Glioblastomas are a devastating form of brain cancer with five year survival rates under 10 percent. From the time of diagnosis, average survival time is less than two years.  The role of CMV in glioblastoma has been a controversial area of research for several years. These new findings, and especially the dramatic survival rates, suggest that the virus may be an effective target for immune therapy. The results presented by Dr. Mitchell and his colleagues should stimulate more basic research on CMV and its potential therapeutic role in brain tumors and possibly other cancers,  said Jane Fountain, Ph.D., program director at the NINDS. The results showed that administering a tetanus booster before the vaccine increased dendritic cell migration to lymph nodes and also had a significant effect on clinical outcomes. The patients who received the tetanus booster lived more than 36.6 months after diagnosis compared to an average survival time of 18.5 months in those who received dendritic cells alone.  We did not expect that enhancing dendritic cell migration would be associated with such a dramatic improvement on clinical outcomes in our patients,  said Dr. Mitchell. Next, the investigators used a mouse model to determine how the tetanus booster increased dendritic cell migration to the lymph nodes. The results suggested that giving a booster shot to mice that have received the tetanus vaccine activated a recall response in the exposed T cells. Acting through a chemical messenger known as CCL3, those T cells increased dendritic cell migration to the lymph nodes, which ultimately enhanced the effect of the dendritic cell vaccine on tumor growth suppression.  Dendritic cell vaccines targeting glioblastoma can be very effective by enhancing migration of dendritic cells. We now understand how we may improve outcomes for patients receiving this type of therapy,  said Dr. Mitchell. He added that larger clinical studies need to be conducted to confirm these results. In addition, more research is necessary to define the role of CMV in glioblastoma and further determine mechanisms to enhance efficacy of vaccines in cancer therapy.","Published: March 20, 2015"

Timothy Kieffer, a professor in the department of cellular and physiological sciences, and scientists from BetaLogics simulated Type 2 diabetes in mice by putting them on a high-fat, high-calorie diet for several weeks. Kieffer s team then surgically implanted pancreatic-like cells that had been grown in the laboratory from human stem cells. Mice that received a combination of the cells with one of three diabetes drugs became as  glucose tolerant  as the healthy mice, meaning they were able to keep their blood sugar in check, even after ingesting a sugary meal. In contrast, a group of mice with simulated Type 2 diabetes that received the drugs but not the transplants remained glucose-intolerant.  Being able to reduce spikes in blood sugar levels is important because evidence suggests it s those spikes that do a lot of the damage   increasing risks for blindness, heart attack, and kidney failure,  says Kieffer, a member of UBC s Life Sciences Institute. The combination therapy also produced an unexpected but welcome result: the mice returned to a normal weight, the same weight as the healthy control group mice that had been reared on a low-fat diet.  Their weight loss was intriguing, because some of the common diabetes therapies often lead to weight gain,  Kieffer said.  We need to do more studies to understand how the cell transplants lead to weight loss.  The team is also investigating if higher number of progenitor cells   beyond the five million tested in this study   can achieve the same results without the need for additional drugs.","Published: March 20, 2015"

Taken out of their home in the hair follicle, for example, and grown in culture, these cells remain true to themselves. After waiting in limbo, these cultured cells become capable of regenerating follicles and other skin structures once transplanted back into skin. It s not clear just how these stem cells   and others elsewhere in the body   retain their ability to produce new tissue and heal wounds, even under extraordinary conditions. New research at Rockefeller University has identified a protein, Sox9, that takes the lead in controlling stem cell plasticity. In a paper published March 18 in Nature, the team describes Sox9 as a  pioneer factor  that breaks ground for the activation of genes associated with stem cell identity in the hair follicle.  We found that in the hair follicle, Sox9 lays the foundation for stem cell plasticity. First, Sox9 makes the genes needed by stem cells accessible, so they can become active. Then, Sox9 recruits other proteins that work together to give these  stemness  genes a boost, amplifying their expression,  says study author Elaine Fuchs, Rebecca C. Lancefield Professor, Robin Chemers Neustein Laboratory of Mammalian Cell Biology and Development.  Without Sox9, this process never happens, and hair follicle stem cells cannot survive.  Sox9 is a type of protein called a transcription factor, which can act like a volume dial for genes. When a transcription factor binds to a segment of DNA known as an enhancer, it cranks up the activity of the associated gene. Recently, scientists identified a less common, but more powerful version: the super-enhancer. Super-enhancers are much longer pieces of DNA, and host large numbers of cell type-specific transcription factors that bind cooperatively. Super-enhancers also contain histones, DNA-packaging proteins, that harbor specific chemical groups   epigenetic marks   that make genes they are associated with accessible so they can be expressed. Using an epigenetic mark associated specifically with the histones of enhancers, first author Rene Adam, a graduate student in the lab, and colleagues, identified 377 of these high-powered gene-amplifying regions in hair follicle stem cells. The majority of these super-enhancers were bound by at least five transcription factors, often including Sox9. Then, they compared the stem cell super-enhancers to those of short-lived stem cell progeny, which have begun to choose a fate, and so lost the plasticity of stem cells. These two types of cells shared only 32 percent of their super-enhancers, suggesting these regions played an important role in skin cell identity. By switching off super-enhancers associated with stem cell genes, these genes were silenced while new super-enhancers were being activated to turn on hair genes. To better understand these dynamics, the researchers took a piece of a super-enhancer, called an epicenter, where all the stem cell transcription factors bind, and they linked it to a gene that glowed green whenever the transcription factors were present. In living mice, all the hair follicle stem cells glowed green, but surprisingly, the green gene turned off when the stem cells were taken from the follicle and placed in culture. When they put the cells back into living skin, the green glow returned. Another clue came from experiments performed by Hanseul Yang, another student in the lab. By examining the new super-enhancers that were gained when the stem cells were cultured, they learned that these new super-enhancers bound transcription factors that were known to be activated during wound-repair. When they used one of these epicenters to drive the green gene, the green glow appeared in culture, but not in skin. When they wounded the skin, then the green glow switched on.  We were learning that some super-enhancers are specifically activated in the stem cells within their native niche, while other super-enhancers specifically switch on during injury,  explained Adam.  By shifting epicenters, you can shift from one cohort of transcription factors to another to adapt to different environments. But we still needed to determine what was controlling these shifts.  The culprit turned out to be Sox9, the only transcription factor expressed in both living tissue and culture. Further experiments confirmed Sox9 s importance by showing, for example, that removing it spelled death for stem cells, while expressing it in the epidermis gave the skin cells features of hair follicle stem cells. These powers seemed to be special to Sox9, placing it atop the hierarchy of transcription factors in the stem cells. Sox9 is one of only a few pioneer factors known in biology that can initiate such dramatic changes in gene expression.  Importantly, we link this pioneer factor to super-enhancer dynamics, giving these domains a  one-two punch  in governing cell identity. In the case of stem cell plasticity, Sox9 appears to be the lead factor that activates the super-enhancers that amplify genes associated with stemness,  Fuchs says.  These discoveries offer new insights into the way in which stem cells choose their fates and maintain plasticity while in transitional states, such as in culture or when repairing wounds.

""This research gives us important clues about the genes that control plant structures and how we can manipulate them to our advantage,"" said study co-author Debra Mohnen, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology in the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. ""The difficulty of breaking down the complicated plant cell wall is a major obstacle to the cost-effective production of biofuels, and this discovery may pave the way for new techniques that make that process more economically viable."" The researchers tested their hypothesis on a species of tree called Populus deltoides, more commonly known as the eastern cottonwood. Working together with colleagues in through the BioEnergy Science Center, they created 11 transgenic trees in which GAUT12.1 was reduced by approximately 50 percent. This tree species is particularly attractive to the biofuel industry because it grows relatively quickly and produces large quantities of biomass in a short period of time. ""Our experiments show that the trees we created were less recalcitrant, meaning that it would be easier to extract sugars from the plant cell walls,"" said the study's lead author Ajaya Biswal, an assistant research scientist in Mohnen's lab. ""But we were particularly happy to see how quickly these trees grew compared to what one would observe in with the wild type."" The plants they tested displayed between 12 and 52 percent increased plant height and between 12 and 44 percent larger stem diameter when compared to controls. Faster growing plants would yield more biomass over a shorter period of time, making them more attractive to both growers and the biofuel industry, Mohnen said. While the researchers emphasize that these are preliminary results, they and their colleagues in BioEnergy Science Center are already preparing new experiments that will test their transgenic trees in a variety of different environments. ""We've already learned a lot from this process, but we are confident that we can expand and improve on our research to achieve even better biomass and understanding of how it is produced,"" said Mohnen, who is also a part of UGA's Complex Carbohydrate Research Center. Their research project was conducted in partnership with the BioEnergy Science Center, one of three U.S. Department of Energy-funded research centers seeking new methods to overcome biomass recalcitrance.

These mutations enable the cells to proliferate, causing relapse and often death. The findings are important because ALL is a leading cause of cancer deaths in children, with 15 percent of ALL patients relapsing with poor survival. The researchers said their findings will lead to new tests to monitor children in remission and to detect signs of relapse. The research was published in the March 19 issue of the journal Nature Communications. Leading the research team were corresponding authors Charles Mullighan, M.D., MBBS(Hons), a member of the St. Jude Children s Research Hospital Department of Pathology; Jinghui Zhang, Ph.D., a member of the St. Jude Department of Computational Biology; and Stephen Hunger, M.D., director of the Center for Childhood Cancer Research at The Children s Hospital of Philadelphia. In their study, the researchers analyzed the genomes of cells from 20 children who had ALL that returned following treatment. Importantly, the researchers analyzed cell samples taken at three stages diagnosis, remission and relapse. Thus, the scientists could analyze in detail the genomes of the cells at the different stages, determining the mutations that drove the relapse of leukemia. Cancers such as leukemia are not a homogeneous disease. Rather they are a witch s brew of different dividing cancer cells, called  clones,  with distinctive sets of mutations. While chemotherapy might kill almost all the clones, some might have escaped therapy, leaving them to multiply to cause relapse.  In our study we wanted to find out the underlying mechanism leading to cancer relapse,  Zhang said.  When the cancer recurs, is it a completely different cancer, or is it an extension, or change, arising from pre-existing cancer?  New genomic analytical technologies enabled the scientists to detect with great sensitivity the mutations in both the  rising  and  falling  clones at the different stages. Previous studies have attempted to work backward by genomically analyzing the relapsed clone to try to trace back its origin. However, such analysis would miss the low levels of the cells that, at diagnosis, would ultimately cause relapse. The researchers  genomic analysis of the cancer clonal cells pinpointed the mutations that drove the leukemia. They also characterized how diverse those mutations were at both diagnosis and relapse finding that the cancer cells were mutating just as wildly and diversely throughout the cancer process.  This finding was interesting, because most people think that the clone that has the most mutations is more likely to survive therapy and evolve, but that doesn t seem to be the case,  Zhang said. A key finding was that in most cases relapse of the cancer was driven by a minor clone, or  subclone,  present at an extremely low level, that survived therapy. This finding has implications for genomic analysis of ALL after a patient s treatment, to determine the likelihood of relapse.  When we are analyzing for the level of minimum residual disease in monitoring remission in patients, we should not only pay attention to the mutations in the predominant clone,  said Zhang.  We should also be tracking what kinds of mutations exist in the minor subclones.  In their analysis, the researchers identified seven specific genes that were highly likely to be mutated in relapsed disease. Researchers at St. Jude and elsewhere are currently exploring the biological functions of the relapse-related genes, and the results may aid in developing ways to identify drugs to target their function. More broadly, the methodology of highly sensitive genomic analysis of cancer cells that Zhang and her colleagues developed can be applied to explore the evolution of other cancers.

The facility, part of the Bill and Rita Clements Advanced Medical Imaging Building on the North Campus near the Moncrief Radiation Oncology Building, uses magnets to generate radioactive isotopes that are used as tracers. These can help detect where treatments should be focused or help oncologists track how well therapies are working.  While it is planned for translational and clinical research, this new technology will ultimately result in more effective patient care,  said Dr. Xiankai Sun, Director of UT Southwestern s Cyclotron and Radiochemistry Program, and Associate Professor of Radiology and the Advanced Imaging Research Center (AIRC). Radioactive isotopes decay, producing positrons - the key to PET (positron-emission tomography) scans, which are used in diagnosis and planning treatment for many types of cancer. Cancer cells consume the isotopes produced by the cyclotron, revealing which are the cancerous cells and allowing the physicians and imaging specialists to track them, or see whether, after a therapy is given, the cancer is responding to therapy.  Positron-emission tomography, enabled by short-lived radiotracers produced by an on-site cyclotron, is an important, non-invasive, medical imaging tool for disease diagnosis, staging, and post-therapy evaluation,  said Dr. Sun, who holds the Dr. Jack Krohmer Professorship in Radiation Physics. Because the isotopes don t have a long lifespan - some as short as two minutes - they can be difficult to transport. Producing them on site can allow more scanning opportunities and more types of isotopes to be produced for expanded research endeavors. It also helps reduce costs otherwise associated with transporting them.  The cyclotron makes short-lived, biomedical radioisotopes readily available on campus, alleviating current challenges in obtaining such radioisotopes from another location, and significantly expanding the basic science and clinical research opportunities through PET,  Dr. Sun said. The cyclotron is expected to aid in a wide variety of studies and clinical trials research across many disciplines, including Radiology, the Advanced Imaging Research Center, the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cardiology, Immunology, Psychiatry, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, and areas involving diabetes, Alzheimer s disease, and dementia.  Developing the full potential of PET will contribute to UT Southwestern s determination to build a world-class imaging research program, and boost the existing recognized strengths of UT Southwestern in biology, genetics, metabolism, and cancer research,  said Dr. Neil Rofsky, Chairman of Radiology and Director of Translational Research for UT Southwestern s Advanced Imaging Research Center.  With the cyclotron as a new core resource, scientists, engineers, and medical professionals across disciplines will be able to work together toward the development and implementation of the latest imaging technologies for better patient care,  said Dr. Rofsky, who holds the Effie and Wofford Cain Distinguished Chair in Diagnostic Imaging.  While there is strong emphasis on cancer applications, the products we create from the cyclotron will enable discoveries that span across multiple areas of medicine and physiology.  The Radiology Department s Cyclotron and Radiochemistry Program was established to leverage the cutting-edge imaging technology of positron-emission tomography for biomedical research, under the auspices of the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) and UT Southwestern, with important input from the Advanced Imaging Research Center and its Director, Dr. Dean Sherry, Professor of Radiology and with the AIRC at UT Southwestern, and Professor of Chemistry at UT Dallas, where he holds the Cecil H. and Ida Green Distinguished Chair in Systems Biology. The technology is especially suited for understanding cancer initiation and progression mechanisms, intermediary metabolism of cancer cells, prognostic evaluation of cancer patients, and eventually the early and individualized diagnosis and corresponding efficacious treatment of cancer. UT Southwestern s Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center is the only National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center in North Texas and one of just 68 NCI-designated cancer centers in the nation. The Simmons Cancer Center includes 13 major cancer care programs with a focus on treating the whole individual with innovative treatments, while fostering research that has the potential to improve patient care and prevention of cancer worldwide. In addition, the Center s education and training programs support and develop the next generation of cancer researchers and clinicians. The Simmons Cancer Center is among only 30 U.S. cancer research centers to be named a National Clinical Trials Network Lead Academic Participating Site, a prestigious new designation by the NCI, and the only Cancer Center in North Texas to be so designated. The designation and associated funding is designed to bolster the cancer center s clinical cancer research for adults and to provide patients access to cancer research trials sponsored by the NCI, where promising new drugs often are tested.","Published: March 20, 2015"

University of California (UC) Berkeley scientists have taken a big step in that direction. A new study by UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco researchers finds that giving a drug that changes the neurochemical balance in the prefrontal cortex of the brain causes a greater willingness to engage in prosocial behaviors, such as ensuring that resources are divided more equally. The researchers also say that future research may lead to a better understanding of the interaction between altered dopamine-brain mechanisms and mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia or addiction, and potentially light the way to possible diagnostic tools or treatments for these disorders. ""Our study shows how studying basic scientific questions about human nature can, in fact, provide important insights into diagnosis and treatment of social dysfunctions,"" said Ming Hsu, a co-principal investigator and assistant professor at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business. ""Our hope is that medications targeting social function may someday be used to treat these disabling conditions,"" said Andrew Kayser, a co-principal investigator on the study, an assistant professor of neurology at UC San Francisco and a researcher in the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute at UC Berkeley. In the study, published online in the journal Current Biology, participants on two separate visits received a pill containing either a placebo or tolcapone, a drug that prolongs the effects of dopamine, a brain chemical associated with reward and motivation in the prefrontal cortex. Participants then played a simple economic game in which they divided money between themselves and an anonymous recipient. After receiving tolcapone, participants divided the money with the strangers in a fairer, more egalitarian way than after receiving the placebo. ""We typically think of fair-mindedness as a stable characteristic, part of one's personality,"" said Hsu. ""Our study doesn't reject this notion, but it does show how that trait can be systematically affected by targeting specific neurochemical pathways in the human brain."" In this double-blind study of 35 participants, including 18 women, neither participants nor study staff members knew which pills contained the placebo or tolcapone, an FDA-approved drug used to treat people with Parkinson's disease, a progressive neurological disorder affecting movement and muscle control. Computational modeling showed Hsu and his colleagues that under tolcapone's influence, game players were more sensitive to and less tolerant of social inequity, the perceived relative economic gap between a study participant and a stranger. By connecting to previous studies showing that economic inequity is evaluated in the prefrontal cortex, a core area of the brain that dopamine affects, this study brings researchers closer to pinpointing how prosocial behaviors such as fairness are initiated in the brain. ""We have taken an important step toward learning how our aversion to inequity is influenced by our brain chemistry,"" said the study's first author, Ignacio S ez, a postdoctoral researcher at the Haas School of Business. ""Studies in the past decade have shed light on the neural circuits that govern how we behave in social situations. What we show here is one brain 'switch' we can affect.""

But not all the impulses arrive at their destination: Certain neurons act as checkpoints and determine whether a pain signal is relayed or not. Researchers from University of Zurich (UZH) identified these neurons and their connections. Moreover, they developed means to specifically activate these neurons, which reduces not only pain -- but astonishingly also alleviates itch. Sensing pain is extremely unpleasant and sometimes hard to bear -- and pain can even become chronic. The perception of pain varies a lot depending on the context in which it is experienced. 50 years ago, neurobiologist Patrick Wall and psychologist Ronald Melzack formulated the so-called ""Gate Control Theory"" of pain. The two researchers proposed that inhibitory nerve cells in the spinal cord determine whether a pain impulse coming from the periphery, such as the foot, is relayed to the brain or not. A team headed by Hanns Ulrich Zeilhofer from the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Zurich did now reveal which inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord are responsible for this control function: As the study published in the science journal Neuron shows, the control cells are located in the spinal dorsal horn and use the amino acid glycine as an inhibitory messenger. With the aid of genetically modified viruses, the research group from UZH managed to specifically interfere with the function of these neurons in mice. They discovered that disabling the glycine-releasing neurons leads to an increased sensitivity to pain and signs of spontaneous pain. Moreover, Zeilhofer's team developed viruses that enable these specific pain-control cells to be activated pharmacologically. Mice treated with these viruses were less sensitive to painful stimuli than their untreated counterparts. Activating these nerve cells also alleviated chronic pain. And the surprising additional result: ""Evidently, the neurons don't just control pain, but also various forms of itch,"" explains Zeilhofer. One key aspect of the Gate Control Theory is that various influences can modulate the pain-controlling neurons' activity. Based on our experience from everyday life, for instance, we know that gently rubbing or holding an injured extremity can alleviate pain in this area. According to the theory, non-painful contact with the skin is supposed to activate the inhibitory cells. Sure enough, the UZH researchers were able to verify this hypothesis and confirm that the inhibitory, glycine-releasing neurons are innervated by such touch-sensitive skin nerves. Moreover, the pharmacologists were able to demonstrate that neurons on the superficial layers of the spinal cord, where the relay of the pain signals takes place, are primarily inhibited by glycine signals. ""These three findings identify for the first the neurons and connections that underlie the Gate Control Theory of pain,"" sums up Zeilhofer. Can these findings be used to treat pain? ""The targeted stimulation or inhibition of particular types of neurons in humans is still a long way off and might only be possible in a few decades' time,"" says Zeilhofer. Another way may well reach the target sooner -- namely via the receptors that are activated by the inhibitory neurons: ""As these receptors are located on the neurons that relay pain signals to the brain, their specific pharmacological activation should also block pain,"" says Hanns Ulrich Zeilhofer. His group has already achieved promising initial results in this field, too. University of Zurich   press release Edmund Foster, Hendrik Wildner, Laetitia Tudeau, Sabine Haueter, William T.

The technique allows researchers to directly observe individual messenger RNA molecules (mRNAs) as they are translated into proteins in living cells. The technique, carried out in living human cells and fruit flies, should help reveal how irregularities in protein synthesis contribute to developmental abnormalities and human disease processes including those involved in Alzheimer's disease and other memory-related disorders. The research is published in the March 20 edition of Science. ""We've never been able to pinpoint exactly when and where mRNAs are translated into proteins,"" said study co-leader Robert H. Singer, Ph.D., professor and co-chair of anatomy and structural biology and co-director of the Gruss Lipper Biophotonics Center at Einstein. ""This capability will be critical for studying the molecular basis of disease, for example, how dysregulation of protein synthesis in brain cells can lead to the memory deficits that occur in neurodegeneration."" Dr. Singer also holds the Harold and Muriel Block Chair in Anatomy & Structural Biology at Einstein. The directions for making proteins are encoded in genes in the cell nucleus. Two steps--transcription and translation--must occur so that the gene's protein-making instructions will lead to actual proteins. In the first step, called transcription, the gene's DNA is ""read"" by molecules of mRNA. These mRNAs then migrate from the nucleus into the cytoplasm and attach to structures called ribosomes. That's where translation, the second step in protein synthesis, occurs: the mRNAs attached to ribosomes function as templates on which proteins are constructed. To visualize translation, Dr. Singer and his colleagues took advantage of a key occurrence during the first round of translation: the ribosome to which mRNAs attach must displace so-called RNA-binding proteins from the mRNAs. The researchers synthesized identical copies of mRNA molecules containing two fluorescent proteins, one green and one red. This meant that in the nucleus (where mRNAs are made), mRNAs labeled with both red and green proteins appear yellow. After migrating to the cytoplasm, the mRNAs can change color depending on their fate. For mRNAs landing on ribosomes, the ribosome displaces the mRNAs' green fluorescent protein. As a result, these mRNA molecules--stripped of their green fluorescent proteins, bound to ribosomes, and ready to be translated into a protein--appear red. Meanwhile, all the untranslated mRNA molecules remain yellow. The technique was dubbed TRICK (for Translating RNA Imaging by Coat protein Knock-off). In a test of TRICK, the collaborators in Germany studied when and where mRNAs for a gene called oskar are expressed in Drosophila eggs, or oocytes. (Drosophila, or fruit flies, are a frequently used model for understanding human disease, and oskar is critical for normal development of fruit fly embryos.) The researchers made oskar mRNAs tagged with red and green fluorescent proteins and inserted the tagged mRNAs into the nuclei of Drosophila oocytes. ""Using TRICK, oskar mRNAs were not translated until they reached the posterior pole of the oocyte,"" said Dr .Singer. ""We suspected this, but now we have definitive proof. Going forward, researchers can use this technique to dissect the cascade of regulatory events required for mRNA translation during Drosophila development."" The researchers also found that protein translation doesn't start immediately after mRNAs exit the nucleus but instead gets underway several minutes after mRNAs have entered the cytoplasm. ""We never knew that timeframe before,"" said Dr. Singer. ""That's another example of what we can learn using this technique."" Albert Einstein College of Medicine   press release James M.

The research adds more troubling evidence to the case against antipsychotic drugs as a treatment for the delusions, hallucinations, agitation and aggression that many people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias experience. In the new issue of the journal JAMA Psychiatry, researchers report findings from nearly 91,000 American veterans over the age of 65 with dementia. Data from each patient who took a psychiatric medication was matched to data from a similar patient who didn't take drugs to calm behavior, by researchers from the University of Michigan (U-M) Medical School and VA Center for Clinical Management Research. Those taking drugs called antipsychotics had outsize risks of death. Among those taking the newer, more commonly used antipsychotics, the risk climbed along with the dose. The study also examined other psychiatric medications. The risk of death seen with the mood stabilizer valproic acid was similar to the antipsychotics. Antidepressants had less risk compared with antipsychotics and valproic acid, but it was still higher than that of those not taking any psychiatric medications to treat behavior issues in dementia. Antipsychotic drugs have significant risk of side effects, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns that their use in people with dementia is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular adverse events and the risk of death. ""The harms associated with using these drugs in dementia patients are clear, yet clinicians continue to use them,"" says lead author and U-M/VA psychiatrist Donovan Maust, M.D., M.S. ""That's likely because the symptoms are so distressing. These results should raise the threshold for prescribing further."" This new study and a recent state-of-the-art review by Maust's co-author Helen Kales, M.D., show that mortality risk of antipsychotics is higher, and benefit lower, than previously thought. But the distress caused by uncontrolled symptoms probably explains why one-third of older adults with dementia who had long-term nursing home stays in 2012 were prescribed an antipsychotic medication, according to a recent U.S. Government Accountability Office report. About 14 percent of dementia patients in the community were prescribed an antipsychotic that same year, the GAO found. Patients, families and their care teams deserve better to prevent and treat distressing dementia symptoms, Maust says. The ""DICE"" approach to assess and manage behavioral symptoms in dementia that has been put forth by Kales and colleagues could help. This approach emphasizes putting non-pharmacological strategies first. But the approach takes more time than writing a prescription, and its use will depend on the support of policy-makers and alignment of reimbursement strategies. ""In other words, non-pharmacologic approaches will only succeed if we as a society agree to pay front-line providers for the time needed to 'do the right thing',"" says Kales. Maust, Kales and their colleagues hope to continue studying the issue of mortality risk from the use of psychotropic drugs in dementia, and prescription patterns for these drugs, using other datasets.

One of the ELEKIN group's lines of research is biomedical engineering. They are developing biosignal analysis systems to help medical staff who make diagnoses. Featuring among other projects is the automatic analysis of spontaneous speech: a smart, non-invasive diagnostic technique for the early detection of Alzheimer's. ELEKIN is collaborating with various players and universities to develop methodologies for the early detection of this and other disorders. Alzheimer's disease is the most significant cause of dementia in the elderly, affecting over 35 million people worldwide. It is reckoned that Alzheimer's could reach epidemic proportions in developed countries unless therapies to cure or prevent it are obtained. Studies conducted so far reveal that the therapies are more effective when they are applied before the brain has become severely damaged. What is more, the spotting of early phases of the disease may help to develop new treatments. Right now, to make a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's, medical examinations, neuropsychological tests, neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and blood tests are carried out; all these tests are not only invasive but are very costly as well. So it seems that smart, non-invasive diagnostic techniques could be valuable tools for the early detecting of dementias. What is known as Automatic Spontaneous Speech Analysis (ASSA) is one of the non-invasive techniques to help in detecting disorders relating to dementia that the UPV/EHU's multidisciplinary research group ELEKIN is working on. This methodology is based on the recording of patients while they are describing some experience in their own lives in a relaxed, leisurely atmosphere, and on the measuring of various parameters. For example, the pauses the patient makes when trying to remember the word he/she wants to say are measured. So the technique is carried out without altering or blocking the patient's abilities as he/she does not perceive the test as something stressful. This work has aimed to provide clinical professionals with tools enabling them to make diagnoses in a much less invasive way. ""It's about quantifying elements or details that the health specialists can see at a glance. But if they have the accurate measurement, it can help them to diagnose disorders or carry out more exact out-patient follow-up,"" explained Karmele L pez de Ipi a, coordinator of the ELEKIN research group. As the researcher maintains, these measurements can be conducted by non-technical personnel in an atmosphere that is normal for the patient. The following, among others, are collaborating in the study: associations of relatives of Alzheimer's patients, University of Vic, TecnoCampus Matar  (Pompeu Fabra University), Center for Biomedical Technology (Madrid), University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and CITA-Alzheimer, a centre for advanced research and therapies. The tests are conducted on people who have not developed the disease, on people who have a family history of it and on patients in collaboration with medical centres and while at all times abiding by ethical criteria and the corresponding protocols. Thanks to this collaboration ""it is possible to study even the preclinical phase or people who have not yet started to develop the disease,"" pointed out Ipi a. Much work is being done internationally in these lines of research, although the ASSA system is not yet being used because it is a technique still being developed and researched. ""The moment will come when we have the system ready to be used routinely to assess patients,"" concluded Ipi a.

OSU researchers found that young women with lower levels of vitamin D were more likely to have clinically significant depressive symptoms over the course of a five-week study, lead author David Kerr said. The results were consistent even when researchers took into account other possible explanations, such as time of year, exercise and time spent outside.  Depression has multiple, powerful causes and if vitamin D is part of the picture, it is just a small part,  said Kerr, an associate professor in the School of Psychological Science at OSU.  But given how many people are affected by depression, any little inroad we can find could have an important impact on public health.  The findings were published recently in the journal Psychiatry Research. Co-authors are Sarina Saturn of the School of Psychological Science; Balz Frei and Adrian Gombart of OSU s Linus Pauling Institute; David Zava of ZRT Laboratory and Walter Piper, a former OSU student now at New York University. Vitamin D is an essential nutrient for bone health and muscle function. Deficiency has been associated with impaired immune function, some forms of cancer and cardiovascular disease, said Gombart, an associate professor of biochemistry and biophysics, principal investigator with the Linus Pauling Institute and international expert on vitamin D and the immune response. People create their own vitamin D when their skin is exposed to sunlight. When sun is scarce in the winter, people can take a supplement, but vitamin D also is found in some foods, including milk that is fortified with it, Gombart said. The recommended daily allowance of vitamin D is 600 IU per day. There is no established level of vitamin D sufficiency for mental health. The new study was prompted in part because there is a widely held belief that vitamin D and depression are connected, but there is not actually much scientific research out there to support the belief, Kerr said.  I think people hear that vitamin D and depression can change with the seasons, so it is natural for them to assume the two are connected,  he said. According to Kerr and his colleagues, a lot of past research has actually found no association between the two, but much of that research has been based on much older adults or special medical populations. Kerr s study focused on young women in the Pacific Northwest because they are at risk of both depression and vitamin D insufficiency. Past research found that 25 percent of American women experience clinical depression at some point in their lives, compared to 16 percent of men, for example. OSU researchers recruited 185 college students, all women ages 18-25, to participate in the study at different times during the school year. Vitamin D levels were measured from blood samples and participants completed a depression symptom survey each week for five weeks. Many women in the study had vitamin D levels considered insufficient for good health, and the rates were much higher among women of color, with 61 percent of women of color recording insufficient levels, compared to 35 percent of other women. In addition, more than a third of the participants reported clinically significant depressive symptoms each week over the course of the study.  It may surprise people that so many apparently healthy young women are experiencing these health risks,  Kerr said. As expected, the women s vitamin D levels depended on the time of year, with levels dropping during the fall, at their lowest in winter, and rising in the spring. Depression did not show as a clear pattern, prompting Kerr to conclude that links between vitamin D deficiency and seasonal depression should be studied in larger groups of at-risk individuals. Researchers say the study does not conclusively show that low vitamin D levels cause depression. A clinical trial examining whether vitamin D supplements might help prevent or relieve depression is the logical next step to understanding the link between the two, Kerr said. OSU researchers already have begun a follow-up study on vitamin D deficiency in women of color. In the meantime, researchers encourage those at risk of vitamin D deficiency to speak with their doctor about taking a supplement.  Vitamin D supplements are inexpensive and readily available.  Kerr said.  They certainly shouldn t be considered as alternatives to the treatments known to be effective for depression, but they are good for overall health.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/antibiotic-nanoparticles-attack-respiratory-infection-186635,Antibiotic Nanoparticles Attack Respiratory Infection HIPS researcher presented her research at the   th European Respiratory Society Lung Science Conference  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Treating respiratory disease is often difficult because drugs have to cross biological barriers such as respiratory tissue and mucosa, and must therefore be given in large quantities in order for an effective amount to reach the target. Now researchers from Germany, Brazil and France have shown that the use of nanoparticles to carry antibiotics across biological barriers can be effective in treating lung infections. Doing so allows better delivery of the drug to the site of infection, and hence prevents the development of antibiotic resistance which may be caused by too large and continued doses of antibiotic. Additionally, such a strategy might help to overcome the rapid metabolism and excretion of the antibiotic from the body, which happens when it is administered by traditional routes, either orally or intravenously. Describing her team s work to the 13th European Respiratory Society Lung Science Conference in Estoril on the 13th of March, Dr Cristiane Carvalho-Wodarz, from the Helmholtz Institute for Pharmaceutical Research, Saarbr cken, Germany, said that, by developing nanoparticles loaded with clarithromycin, an antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of respiratory infections, they have been able to mimick the process that occurs after inhalation in vivo by delivering the drug through aerosol deposition to lung cells. Nanoparticles, which are in the same size range as a virus -  millions of times smaller than a tennis ball - were prepared by adding a biodegradable polymer oil, stabiliser and clarithromycin dissolved in solvents, to an aqueous surfactant solution.  Subsequently, the solvents were completely removed.  The delivery  of nanoparticles in this way enables their deposition in cells cultivated in vitro in a similar way to the deposition in vivo, which take place in the alveoli (air sacs found in the respiratory tract),  Dr Carvalho-Wodarz will say. The researchers used the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus as the model for their experiment, since it is one of the major causes of hospital-acquired infection and also plays a crucial role in the lung infections which are common in the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis. The tiny clarithromycin nanoparticles (CLARI-NPs), were able to access the bacteria located either in biofilms (cells sticking to each other on a surface) or inside individual lung cells.  Neither of these locations is conducive to effective drug delivery through traditional routes,  says Dr Carvalho-Wodarz,  so we were pleased to see that not only did the use of CLARI-NPs allow the uptake of the antibiotic by the lung cells, but also that there were no toxic effects on all the cell types on which we tested.  To date the work has been in vitro, using human bronchial cells. The researchers now hope to evaluate its effectiveness in an animal model, probably mice.  They would also like to test the same nanoparticles loaded with other drugs used against lung infections, and in particular those in which the infectious agent becomes drug-resistant after the continued large doses that may be required.  Using nanoparticles to deliver drugs to a local site of infection is a promising strategy for overcoming side effects, increasing treatment efficacy, and overcoming resistance. The nanoparticles we have developed have a number of advantages as drug carriers; they do not provoke a toxic effect, they are highly stable, they release the drug over a sustained period, and they can overcome cellular barriers. We believe that our formulation shows promise to improve the antibacterial efficacy which could help patients with lung infections, since the antibiotic can reach the infection site directly and therefore decrease the side effects we see during traditional routes of administration,  Dr Carvalho-Wodarz will conclude.","Published: March 19, 2015"

Published today in Nature, their remarkable technical feat in obtaining a molecular phylogeny based on Pleistocene protein sequences is a first, which could herald a new chapter in palaeontology. Researchers in the University s BioArCh research facility and Centre of Excellence in Mass Spectrometry were called in by the Natural History Museum and the American Museum of Natural History to resolve the long-standing question of the fossils of Toxodon and Macrauchenia, the South American native ungulates or hooved mammals the last of which disappeared only 10,000 years ago. The research shows that South American ungulates, similar to those whose fossils were found by Darwin 180 years ago in Uruguay and Argentina, are actually related to mammals like horses rather than elephants and other species with ancient evolutionary ties to Africa as some taxonomists have maintained Previously, attempts by scientists to pinpoint the origin of animals using morphology-based analysis and ancient DNA, had failed. The latter approach was compromised because scientists were unable to recover any identifiable mammalian DNA from fossil specimens. This is likely to be the case for large numbers of important fossils from tropical or temperate deposits, as DNA preservation is ultimately controlled by the thermal history of the material. But the structural protein, collagen, is likely to survive around ten times longer than DNA so the York scientists used proteomic analysis to screen 48 fossil bone samples of Toxodon platensis and Macrauchenia patachonica, discovered in the 19th century in the same area as those recovered by Darwin.  This produced sequences covering more than 90 per cent of the collagen molecule, effectively providing a phylogenetic barcode for the two species. The York research team was headed by Professor Matthew Collins, of BioArCh, and Professor Jane Thomas-Oates, director of York s Centre of Excellence in Mass Spectrometry, and included PhD student Frido Welker and Dr Jessica Thomas from the University s Department of Biology. Dr Thomas, who conducted the phylogenetic analysis, said  By producing the most comprehensive example of sequencing of its type, we have been able to resolve the taxonomic placement of these mammals, and solve a question that has baffled paleaontologists for more than a century.  Professor Collins said:  We now have the potential to address many more of these challenges and to explore the evolutionary process much further back in prehistory.  Frido Welker, a Ph.D. student at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and in BioArCh at York, said:  We are developing new proteomic techniques and applying them to the archaeological and palaeoanthropological record. To get 90 per cent sequence coverage for both species is a direct result of those efforts, and truly fantastic given the burial time and location.    Professor Thomas-Oates, of the University s Department of Chemistry, added:  Our long-standing collaboration with scientists at Bruker Daltonics made it possible to analyse these samples using the most up to date mass spectrometric instrumentation.  The outstanding quality of the data was crucial in enabling us to determine the collagen sequences.  Professor Ian Barnes, a curator at the Natural History Museum said:  Although the bones of these animals had been studied for over 180 years, no clear picture of their origins had been reached. Our analyses began by investigating ancient DNA to try to resolve the problem.  Ross MacPhee, a curator in the American Museum of Natural History s Department of Mammalogy said:  Fitting South American ungulates to the mammalian family tree has always been a major challenge for paleontologists, because anatomically they were these weird mosaics, exhibiting features found in a huge variety of quite unrelated species living all over the place.  This is what puzzled Darwin and his collaborator Richard Owen so much in the early 19th century. With all of these conflicting signals, they couldn t say whether these ungulates were related to giant rodents, or elephants, or camels or what have you.  With modern techniques of phylogenetic interpretation, the researchers were able to conclusively show that the closest living relatives of these species were the perissodactyls, the group that includes horses, rhinos, and tapirs. This makes them part of Laurasiatheria, one of the major groups of placental mammals. The molecular evidence corroborates a view held by some leading paleontologists that the ancestors of these South American ungulates came from North America more than 60 million years ago, probably just after the mass extinction that killed off non-avian dinosaurs and many other vertebrates. Because the South American ungulates were such a large and varied group, it is not clear whether other lineages not studied by the researchers all had the same origin. This research was funded through the Systematics and Taxonomy research scheme (SynTax) supported by the Systematics Association, Linnean Society and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and the Natural Environment Research Council.","Published: March 19, 2015"

The team of scientists from TGAC s Data Infrastructure and Algorithms and Plant and Microbial Genomics groups trialled the miniaturised sensing system by sequencing environmental samples, containing DNA from hundreds or thousands of different organisms.  The team experimented first with a mock community, where they used a simple set of DNA samples from twenty bacteria, created for the Human Microbiome Project. Having developed their experimental and data methods, they then tested real environmental samples sequencing them on the MinION and Illumina platforms for comparison.  Their aim was to sequence the microscopic biological molecules in the air around us   bacteria, spores and viruses. Many key crop diseases spread via the air as spores, as well as some animal and human diseases. Analysing such samples triggers technical issues, where there are very low levels of biological material present when sequencing DNA from air. Although the scientists faced challenges working with complex metagenomic (genetic material recovered directly from an environment) samples in live-time, the introduction of the MinION as a potential portable laboratory made a major impact to the research s goal.   In-field surveillance presents a number of hurdles. With its compact size, cheap device cost, simple library preparation and streaming nature, the MinION provides a significant step towards addressing these challenges,  said Dr Richard Leggett, member of the MAP task force and Project Leader in the Data Infrastructure & Algorithms Group at TGAC. The scientists used the bioinformatics tool, Kontaminant in their research, which was originally developed for screening DNA for contamination from other species and then adapted this tool to analyse metagenomic samples and identify species as they are being sequenced on the MinION. They also developed a tool called NanoOK, which is designed to analyse Nanopore data and help to understand the MinION s error profile.  Dr Leggett and the rest of the task force recently presented the TGAC team s preliminary findings at the world renowned scientific conference, Advances in Genome Biology & Technology (AGBT) at Marco Island in Florida in his talk, titled:  Towards Real-Time Surveillance Approaches Using Nanopore Sequencers . Dr Leggett said:  Our research is still at an early stage, but indications are that the MinION is capable of sequencing complex metagenomic samples. We were able to demonstrate species identification from the mock community using Kontaminant and to run this on a very low-powered computer (the Raspberry Pi), which would be capable of being deployed in-field with the MinION.  The scientists choose the MinION for their area of research due to the cost efficiency, simplicity and streaming nature of the portable sequencing device. Although it does have a significant error profile, taking into account its miniature sequencing capability, it was still able to produce large areas of highly-accurate DNA analyses.  It's great to be part of the MinION Access Programme, as it has provided us with access to the very latest sequencing technology. Though the MinION is not perfect, current sequencing platforms are just too large and cost too much to purchase to consider deploying in-field,  said Dr Leggett.  The ability to deploy real time monitoring in the field could change agriculture methods and how we look at crop disease outbreaks, as well as human disease epidemics. These are early days, but it looks like a combination of a small low power sequencing device with the correct experimental and computational approaches can spot pathogens,  said Dr Matt Clark, head of the MAP task force and Plant and Microbial Genomics Group Leader at TGAC. In addition to studying metagenomics, the TGAC MAP team are also interested in understanding new technologies such as the MinION and providing the scientific community with tools to help them get the most out of these technologies. The research group will continue to be part of the MAP and will be developing this work further by looking at other research areas for the MinION, with a view to paper publication, tools releases, collaborations and grant applications.  The work has been a collaborative effort amongst the MAP task force at TGAC: Matthew Clark, Rob Davey, Mario Caccamo, Darren Heavens and Richard Leggett.","Published: March 19, 2015"

Other recent examples have been  mini-brains  to study Alzheimer s disease and  mini-livers  to model liver disease. Scientists use the technique to model how diseases occur and to screen for potential drugs; they are an alternative to the use of animals in research. Cystic fibrosis is a monogenic condition   in other words, it is caused by a single genetic mutation in patients, though in some cases the mutation responsible may differ between patients. One of the main features of cystic fibrosis is the lungs become overwhelmed with thickened mucus causing difficulty breathing and increasing the incidence of respiratory infection. Although patients have a shorter than average lifespan, advances in treatment mean the outlook has improved significantly in recent years. Researchers at the Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute used skin cells from patients with the most common form of cystic fibrosis caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene referred to as the delta-F508 mutation. Approximately three in four cystic fibrosis patients in the UK have this particular mutation. They then reprogrammed the skin cells to an induced pluripotent state, the state at which the cells can develop into any type of cell within the body. Using these cells   known as induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells   the researchers were able to recreate embryonic lung development in the lab by activating a process known as gastrulation, in which the cells form distinct layers including the endoderm and then the foregut, from which the lung  grows , and then pushed these cells further to develop into distal airway tissue. The distal airway is the part of the lung responsible for gas exchange and is often implicated in disease, such as cystic fibrosis, some forms of lung cancer and emphysema. The results of the study are published in the journal Stem Cells and Development.  In a sense, what we ve created are  mini-lungs ,  explains Dr Nick Hannan, who led the study.  While they only represent the distal part of lung tissue, they are grown from human cells and so can be more reliable than using traditional animal models, such as mice. We can use them to learn more about key aspects of serious diseases   in our case, cystic fibrosis.  The genetic mutation delta-F508 causes the CFTR protein found in distal airway tissue to misfold and  malfunction,  meaning it is not appropriately expressed on the surface of the cell, where its purpose is to facilitate the movement of chloride in and out of the cells. This in turn reduces the movement of water to the inside of the lung; as a consequence, the mucus becomes particular thick and prone to bacterial infection, which over time leads to scarring   the  fibrosis  in the disease s name. Using a fluorescent dye that is sensitive to the presence of chloride, the researchers were able to see whether the  mini-lungs  were functioning correctly. If they were, they would allow passage of the chloride and hence changes in fluorescence; malfunctioning cells from cystic fibrosis patients would not allow such passage and the fluorescence would not change. This technique allowed the researchers to show that the  mini-lungs  could be used in principle to test potential new drugs: when a small molecule currently the subject of clinical trials was added to the cystic fibrosis  mini lungs , the fluorescence changed   a sign that the cells were now functioning when compared to the same cells not treated with the small molecule.  We re confident this process could be scaled up to enable us to screen tens of thousands of compounds and develop mini-lungs with other diseases such as lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,  adds Dr Hannan.  This is far more practical, should provide more reliable data and is also more ethical than using large numbers of mice for such research.  The research was primarily funded by the European Research Council, the National Institute for Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre and the Evelyn Trust.","Published: March 19, 2015"

Advaita Bioinformatics, The Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) and researchers at Yale University have each developed cloud-based applications and libraries that utilize SWATH Proteomics data in novel ways allowing researchers to analyze and compare proteomics and genomics data. This effort furthers the OneOmics project s goal of eliminating the informatics barriers that exist between different Omics disciplines. Rob Moritz, Associate Professor, and his team from ISB developed the SWATHAtlas Ion Library Generator Application that enables fast and simplified access to ISB libraries for use in NGP experiments with SWATH Acquisition. Currently, ISB hosts ion libraries for the Human, Yeast and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteomes. Moritz, who was influential in establishing the partnership said, ""We are delighted to be part of this project SCIEX and Illumina. Collectively, our tools developed at ISB and in the wider academic community will provide a powerful solution that will impact the way that proteomics research and systems biology will be conducted in the future"". Deriving biological insight from genomics and proteomics data is at the cutting edge of bioinformatics. Advaita Bioinformatics, a leader in the development of analytic solutions for high-throughput biological data, has developed the iPathwayGuide App, for the BaseSpace  platform. The App performs biochemical pathway analysis, gene ontology analysis, miRNA prediction, and drug and disease analyses of SWATH Proteomics and Illumina RNASeq data. The App simplifies the process of finding real biological insights from integrated proteomics and transcriptomics data sets, and will help to advance biomarker discovery and disease research. Dr. Chris Colangelo (proteomics) and Dr. Rob Kitchen (genomics bioinformatics) from Yale University collaborated to develop the RNASeq Translator Application for the BaseSpace  platform that translates the output from an Illumina RNASeq experiment into a protein database that can be used to create ion libraries to mine SCIEX SWATH Acquisition data. The application enables a more targeted approach to proteomics analysis within the context of identifying splice variants, which can be critically important to researchers seeking to understand the genetics of a particular disease. This serial workflow is a common requirement for systems biology research, but until now has required complex bioinformatics protocols that are beyond the reach of all but a few specialized laboratories.  SWATH Acquisition enables researchers to accurately and reproducibly quantify several thousand proteins across hundreds of samples, leading to meaningful conclusions about how the proteome changes in response to perturbation , said Aaron Hudson, Senior Director of Academic and Clinical Research Business of SCIEX.  The next logical step is to integrate those proteomic conclusions with other omics results, such as genomics and transcriptomics. Our collaborators at ISB, Yale University, and Advaita Bioinformatics, have all launched complimentary applications that expand the workflow and provide general access and standardization of data analysis across two of the largest fields in life science."" Released earlier this month, the SCIEX SWATH Proteomics Cloud Tool Kit suite of applications is hosted on Illumina s BaseSpace  cloud computing environment, creating a single location for genomics and proteomics  big data,  and enabling fast, secure, and streamlined analysis of complex multi-omics data sets. By providing simplified informatics within a web-based environment, the solution is designed to help advance biomarker discovery and the development of new drugs for diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer s and heart disease.","Published: March 19, 2015"

Every week the intestines regenerate a new lining, sloughing off the equivalent surface area of a studio apartment and refurbishing it with new cells. For decades, researchers have known that the party responsible for this extreme makeover were intestinal stem cells, but it wasn t until this year that Scott Magness, PhD, associate professor of medicine, cell biology and physiology, and biomedical engineering, figured out a way to isolate and grow thousands of these elusive cells in the laboratory at one time. This high throughput technological advance now promises to give scientists the ability to study stem cell biology and explore the origins of inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal cancers, and other gastrointestinal disorders. But it didn t come easy. One Step Forward . . . When Magness and his team first began working with intestinal stem cells some years ago, they quickly found themselves behind the eight ball. Their first technique involved using a specific molecule or marker on the surface of stem cells to make sure they could distinguish stem cells from other intestinal cells. Then Magness s team would fish out only the stem cells from intestinal tissues and grow the cells in Petri dishes. But there was a problem.  Even though all of the isolated cells had the same stem cell marker, only one out of every 100 could  self-renew  and differentiate into specialized cells like a typical stem cell should. (Stem cells spawn cells that have specialized functions necessary for any organ to work properly.)  The question was: why didn t the 99 others behave like stem cells?  Magness said.  We thought it was probably because they re not all the same, just like everybody named Judy doesn t look the same. There are all kinds of differences, and we ve been presuming that these cells are all the same based on this one name, this one molecular marker. That s been a problem. But the only way to solve it so we could study these cells was to look at intestinal stem cells at the single cell level, which had never been done before.  Magness is among a growing contingent of researchers who recognize that many of the biological processes underlying health and disease are driven by a tiny fraction of the 37 trillion cells that make up the human body. Individual cells can replenish aging tissues, develop drug resistance, and become vehicles for viral infections. And yet the effects of these singular actors are often missed in biological studies that focus on pooled populations of thousands of seemingly  identical  cells. Distinguishing between the true intestinal stem cells and their cellular look-a-likes would require isolating tens of thousands of stem cells and tracking the behavior of each individual cell over time. But Magness had no idea how to accomplish that feat. Enter Nancy Allbritton, PhD, chair of the UNC/NCSU Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering. The two professors met one day to discuss Magness joining the biomedical engineering department as an adjunct faculty member. And they did discuss it. And Magness did join. But the meeting quickly turned into collaboration. One of Allbritton s areas of expertise is microfabrication   the ability to squeeze large devices into very small footprints. During their meeting, Allbritton showed Magness her latest creation, a device smaller than a credit card dotted with 15,000 tiny wells for culturing cells.  It was like a light bulb went off, and I realized I was looking at the answer to a billion of our problems,  Magness said. Micro Magic Each microwell is as thick as a strand of hair. By placing individual stem cells into the microwells, Magness and his postdoc Adam Gracz, PhD, could watch the cells grow into fully developed tissue structures known as mini-guts. Each microwell could be stamped with a specific address, which would allow researchers to track stem cells that were behaving as expected and those that weren t. Allbritton s lab came up with another feature during collaboration with Magness s team. If the researchers decided they wanted to study a specific mini-gut further, they could use a special tool known as a microwand to pop out the magnetized well and either grow the tissue separately or extract DNA for genetic analyses. The new technology is designed to help researchers dissect the mechanisms of intestinal stem cell biology and investigate why some cells behave differently than others. It can also help scientists explore how a cell s neighborhood or  niche  might impact the cell s behavior. This is important because, in an actual gut, stem cells don t exist in a vacuum; they re surrounded by almost a dozen other cell types, including other epithelial cells, immune cells, muscle cells, and nerve cells. The new technology allowed Magness s lab to mix different cell types and culture them together to see what would happen when those cells lived within close proximity of each other. Cellular Precision Medicine For example, epithelial cells called Paneth cells had already been shown to support the growth of intestinal stem cells. Gracz decided to use the new technology to test the hypothesis that the more Paneth cells in the neighborhood, the better the stem cells would grow. He examined thousands of wells where Paneth and stem cells had been cultured together, and he was surprised to find that the number of Paneth cells did not seem to affect stem cell growth. However, when Gracz looked closer, he discovered that intestinal stem cells that were touching Paneth cells did have a survival advantage over those that were not touching the Paneth cells, indicating that direct cell-to-cell contact was required to provide support. These results were published in the journal Nature Cell Biology.  With this platform we could go back and test experimentally some hypotheses that have been proposed in the literature,  Gracz said.  We ve been able to do that in a way that wasn t possible before. The most powerful part of this approach is that it allows us to get deeper and deeper into the science of the gut with more and more resolution. We ll be able to see things and study them, especially as they relate to human health and disease, to a greater degree than before.  The researchers say that the new technology could also be applicable to cells derived from other tissue, such as breast, pancreas, or practically any other part of the body. One day, the technology could become part of a precision medicine approach to home in on the behavior of single stem cells as indicators of an individual s response to specific drugs.  The big idea emerging in biology that s cool but confounding is something called stochasticity   the notion that different behaviors of an organ s constituent parts drive one collective behavior of the organ as a whole,  Gracz said.  So all the stem cells might be doing different things, but then the outcome that keeps your body running is hopefully always the same.  Magness added,  Single cell technology like this allows us to dissect this stochasticity and pull it apart, and then later we can put it all back together again to understand a disease much better than we do right now. And understanding a disease better allows us to come up with better treatments for patients.  In the department of medicine, Magness is part of the division of gastroenterology and hepatology.

Their findings, published in Nature, show that prior to the mass migrations of the 20th century there was a striking pattern of rich but subtle genetic variation across the UK, with distinct groups of genetically similar individuals clustered together geographically. By comparing this information with DNA samples from over 6,000 Europeans, the team was also able to identify clear traces of the population movements into the UK over the past 10,000 years. Their work confirmed, and in many cases shed further light on, known historical migration patterns. Key findingsThe Wellcome Trust-funded People of the British Isles study analysed the DNA of 2,039 people from rural areas of the UK, whose four grandparents were all born within 80km of each other. Because a quarter of our genome comes from each of our grandparents, the researchers were effectively sampling DNA from these ancestors, allowing a snapshot of UK genetics in the late 19th century. They also analysed data from 6,209 individuals from 10 (modern) European countries. To uncover the extremely subtle genetic differences among these individuals the researchers used cutting-edge statistical techniques, developed by four of the team members. They applied these methods, called fineSTRUCTURE and GLOBETROTTER, to analyse DNA differences at over 500,000 positions within the genome. They then separated the samples into groups of genetically similar individuals, without knowing where in the UK the samples came from. By plotting each person onto a map of the British Isles, using the centre point of their grandparents  birth places, they were able to see how this distribution correlated with their genetic groupings. The researchers were then able to  zoom in  to examine the genetic patterns in the UK at levels of increasing resolution. At the broadest scale, the population in Orkney (islands to the north of Scotland) emerged as the most genetically distinct. At the next level, Wales forms a distinct genetic group, followed by a further division between north and south Wales. Then the north of England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland collectively separate from southern England, before Cornwall forms a separate cluster. Scotland and Northern Ireland then separate from northern England. The study eventually focused at the level where the UK was divided into 17 genetically distinct clusters of people. Dr Michael Dunn, Head of Genetics & Molecular Sciences at the Wellcome Trust, said:  These researchers have been able to use modern genetic techniques to provide answers to the centuries-old question - where we come from. Beyond the fascinating insights into our history, this information could prove very useful from a health perspective, as building a picture of population genetics at this scale may in future help us to design better genetic studies to investigate disease.

Their findings show the promise of a technique that may be used to identify the aging behavior of materials and to examine delicate works of art. The research, which appears in the journal Analytical Chemistry, relies on a method employing nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or NMR spectroscopy, which reveals the physical and chemical properties of atoms in a given substance, as well as the more commonly known magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Because this is a non-invasive method, it can be used to examine and evaluate the most fragile of materials without damaging them,  explains Alexej Jerschow, a professor in NYU s Department of Chemistry and one of the study s co-authors.  As well as offering insight into the material qualities and the preservation state of an artifact, the results provide a more complete picture of the variation of properties across the samples and give critical insight into the mechanisms of the material deterioration,  adds co-author Torunn Klokkernes, head of Collection Management at the University of Oslo s Museum of Cultural History.  Historically, the treatment of skin-based clothing has varied among different cultures,  explains co-author Eleonora Del Federico, professor of chemistry at the Pratt Institute.  Therefore, the NMR technique, in principle, could aid researchers in determining a specific tanning technique, but also provide insight into the provenance of a particular artifact.  The team employed NMR spectroscopy and MRI to evaluate two skin-tanning methods on samples of various ages: one using cod liver oil and the other employing a willow bark extract commonly used in tanning. These two methods were compared with an untreated skin. They found that skin samples treated using the two tanning methods could be differentiated by their relaxation properties similar to the way healthy tissue is distinguished from diseased tissue in clinical MRI scans. Changes in the chemistry of the skin samples could also be detected, giving insight into the changes brought about by the tanning processes. All of this information could be acquired without damaging the samples, making it a promising approach for the study of other, historically important artifacts. The study s other authors included Cindie Kehlet, an assistant professor chemistry at the Pratt Institute, as well as NYU graduate student Lizheng Zhu and postdoctoral fellow Andrew Ilott. The study was supported, in part, by funding from the National Science Foundation (1412064) as well as the Alfred P.

Recent studies have indicated a low level of cardiac muscle cell (cardiomyocytes) proliferation in adult mammals, but it is insufficient to repair damaged hearts. A team led by Ed Morrisey, PhD, a professor of Medicine and Cell and Developmental Biology and the scientific director of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, has now shown that a subset of RNA molecules, called microRNAs, is important for cardiomyocyte cell proliferation during development and is sufficient to induce proliferation in cardiomyocytes in the adult heart. MicroRNAs, which do not generate proteins, repress gene expression by binding messenger RNAs, which do generate proteins, and promote their degradation. The findings appear this week in Science Translational Medicine. The team found that the loss of the microRNA cluster miR302-367 in mice led to decreased cardiomyocyte cell proliferation during development. In contrast, increased expression of the microRNA cluster in adult hearts led to a reactivation of proliferation in the normally non-reproducing adult cardiomyocytes. This reactivation occurred, in part, through repression of a pathway called Hippo that governs cell proliferation and organ size.  The Hippo pathway normally represses cell proliferation when it is turned on. The cluster miR302-367 targets three of the major kinase components in the Hippo pathway, reducing pathway activity, which allows cardiomyocytes to re-enter the cell cycle and begin to regrow heart muscle,  explains Morrisey.  This is a case of repressing a repressor.  In adult mice, re-expression of the microRNA cluster reactivated the cell cycle in cardiomyocytes, resulting in reduced scar formation after an experimental myocardial infarction injury was induced in the mice. There was also an increase in the number of heart muscle cells in these same mice.   However, long-term expression of more than several months of the microRNA cluster caused heart muscle cells to de-differentiation and become less functional.  This suggested to us that persistent reactivation of the cell cycle in adult cardiomyocytes could be harmful and causes the heart to fail,  says Morrisey. The investigators surmised that cardiomyocytes likely need to de-differentiate to divide, but they may lose their ability to contract over time.  We overcame this limitation by injecting synthetic microRNAs with a short half-life called mimics into the mice,  says Morrisey. Mimic treatment for seven days after cardiac infarction led to the desired increase in cardiomyocyte proliferation and regrowth of new heart muscle, which resulted in decreased fibrosis and improved heart function after injury. Importantly, the team found that the transient seven-day treatment did not lead to the progressive loss of cardiac function as seen in the genetic models of increased microRNA expression. Overall, these results suggested that any treatment that promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation to improve cardiac regeneration will likely need to be transient to avoid the deleterious effects of maintaining a high level of proliferation and de-differentiation in a tissue that is normally non-proliferative.  The next stage in this study is to determine whether miRNA mimics will work in a larger animal model and to collaborate with bioengineers to create a local delivery system for the heart, rather than giving it systemically,  notes Morrisey.

A team of Boston College chemists details a new approach in which a ""warhead"" molecule is sent to attack bacteria - and spare healthy human cells - by targeting a pair of lipids found on the surface of deadly germs, according to a report today in the journal Nature Communications. The new strategy required the researchers to develop new type of  warhead molecule  capable of selectively targeting bacteria, overcoming biological conditions that interfere with bonding to pathogens and avoiding healthy human cells, said Boston College Associate Professor of Chemistry Jianmin Gao, the lead author of the report. The BC team found answers to those challenges in the covalent chemistry of lipids, Gao said.  In contrast to other efforts focused on the charge-to-charge attraction between molecules, we are using a completely different mechanism to target bacterial cells,  said Gao.  Our method exploits the covalent chemistry of lipids   where the lipids react with synthetic molecules to form new chemical structures based on the formation of new covalent bonds.  Pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to conventional antibiotics pose increasingly serious threats to public health. Researchers in medicinal chemistry, particularly those who seek to develop new antibiotics, are constantly looking for new ways to identify and differentiate bacterial pathogens from host cells within the human body. Gao said bacterial cells are known to display a different set of lipids in their membranes. Prior research has focused on the use of positively charged peptides to target negatively charged lipids on the surface of bacterial cells. The approach has seen limited success as the charge-charge attraction between the attacking molecules and bacteria is prone to weakening by the presence of salt and other molecules, said Gao. The researchers developed a novel, unnatural amino acid that serves as a suitable molecular warhead to target bacterial pathogens. Gao and his group sent the warhead molecule after bacterial lipids known as amine-presenting lipids - specifically phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and lysyl phosphatidylglycerol (Lys-PG) - which can be selectively derivatized to form iminoboronates, a covalent bond forming process that allows the selective recognition and labeling of bacterial cells. In addition, because amine-presenting lipids are scarce on the surface of mammalian cells, they are able to seek out and label bacterial cells with a high degree of selectivity, Gao said. Furthermore, iminoboronate formation can be reversed under physiologic conditions, giving the new method a high degree of control and allowing the warhead molecules to self-correct if unintended targets are reached. Gao said a large number of bacterial species present PE and Lys-PG on their surfaces, making the covalent labeling strategy applicable to many applications in the diagnosis of bacterial infections and the delivery of antibiotic therapies.  For the short term, we hope this work will inspire other people to consider using covalent chemistry for interrogating biological systems. Going into the future, we are excited to explore the potential of our chemistry for imaging bacterial infections. We are also working hard to apply our current findings to facilitate the targeted delivery of potent antibiotics to bacterial cells only. ","Published: March 19, 2015"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/treating-canine-periodontal-disease-212340,Treating Canine Periodontal Disease  The class of compounds  designed to resolve inflammation  has potential to treat chronic disease in animals and humans  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Traverse Biosciences has signed an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York to develop a drug to treat canine periodontal disease. The potential therapy would fulfill an unmet medical need, as periodontitis affects approximately 80 percent of dogs by the age of three and leads to tooth loss. The drug candidate comes from a discovery by Stony Brook University scientists who have developed a library of proprietary agents designed to treat inflammation. This technology to treat inflammation is licensed by Traverse Biosciences to commercialize animal health applications of these promising drug candidates with an option to license human health applications. Periodontal disease is not only prevalent in dogs. It remains one of the most widespread human diseases in the world, is the primary cause of tooth loss in adults, and has been associated with chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and various cancers. The drug compounds were invented by Lorne Golub, DMD, MD (Honorary), Distinguished Professor in the Department of Oral Biology and Pathology in the Stony Brook University School of Dental Medicine, and Francis Johnson, PhD, President of Chem-Master International Inc. and Professor of Chemistry and Pharmacology at Stony Brook. The partnership with Chem-Master helps to strengthen research of the technology, as expertise in medicinal chemistry is provided by Dr. Johnson and colleagues and biology by Dr. Golub and colleagues. Traverse's initial focus will be animal health, particularly canine periodontal disease. This offers a lower regulatory hurdle and faster path to market. The company s lead compound, TRB-N0224, is envisioned as the first FDA approved, once daily, edible prescription medication for the prevention of canine periodontal disease. Drs. Golub and Johnson have joined Traverse as scientific co-founders; Peter Donnelly, Director of the Office of Technology Licensing and Industry Relations (OTLIR) at Stony Brook University, has been appointed to represent the Research Foundation as a Board Observer.  Stony Brook University has a strong history and reputation of research, innovation and entrepreneurship,  says David O. Conover, Vice President of Research at Stony Brook University.  We are happy to work with companies like Traverse Biosciences to ensure that this legacy continues for our faculty, staff, and students, as well in the regional community.   This license agreement provides Traverse Biosciences with access to a pipeline of promising drug candidates invented by world-renowned scientists with a significant track record of success,  says Joseph Scaduto, Founder and CEO.  We are excited to work closely with the Research Foundation to rapidly advance this technology towards market, for the benefit of health, society, and the innovation economy.  The compounds are chemically-modified curcumins, the active ingredient in turmeric. During inflammation, the body produces excessive levels of enzymes that break down collagen and destroy tissue. These enzymes-called matrix metalloproteinases, or MMPs-need zinc at the active site of the enzyme molecule to function properly; the chemically-modified curcumins bind the zinc, normalizing enzyme levels and inhibiting their effect. The novel, multifunctional anti-inflammatory agents also constrain inflammatory  mediators -biochemical compounds produced by our own body cells that  recruit  inflammatory cells to the site.  This platform technology builds upon a long history of research, discovery, and drug development, which has the potential to broadly impact a wide variety of veterinary and human health conditions,  says Dr. Golub.  We plan to work closely with Traverse Biosciences as a scientific co-founder to commercialize our MMP inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of a range of chronic inflammatory diseases.  Earlier in Dr. Golub s career at Stony Brook, he and colleagues with research support from the NIH and industry, discovered and later developed non-antibiotic properties of tetracycline as inhibitors of MMPs and inflammatory mediators for various diseases. The research ultimately resulted in two FDA-approved drugs, Periostat  (now generic) for periodontitis and Oracea  for the treatment of inflammatory skin condition acne/rosacea. The Office of Technology Licensing and Industry Relations negotiated the licensing agreement with Traverse. The OTLIR partners with SBU inventors and the business community, helps protect intellectual property, and identifies and works with existing companies and entrepreneurs to license the rights to intellectual property and bring it to market.  The goal is to then use success in animal health to advance the indications for human health,  says Sean Boykevisch, Assistant Director for Life Sciences in the OTLIR, who led license negotiations on behalf of the Research Foundation. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that half of U.S. adults aged 30 years and older have periodontitis; the annual cost of periodontal therapy has been judged to exceed $14 billion in the U.S. alone.  We look forward to a productive partnership with Traverse Biosciences to develop these chemically-modified curcumins for a variety of therapeutic indications impacting both human and animal health,  Boykevisch says.  The partnership also provides an opportunity to support the growth of a new venture in the region that was specifically launched to commercialize intellectual property invented at Stony Brook University.  The drugs were developed in concert with the New York State Center for Biotechnology at Stony Brook University. The Center provided financial support to help the inventors develop their lead compound and for follow-on animal studies. It arranged for intellectual property services, helped position the company for more financing, and provided office space.  The Center for Biotechnology and Stony Brook University are strongly committed to continuing to develop programs aimed at supporting the translation of biomedical science into products that will impact human health,  says Yacov Shamash, Vice President for Economic Development at Stony Brook University.  Support for emerging technologies, not only on the research and development side but also strategic business management, is critically important to the success of new ventures which is what will ultimately lead to new healthcare treatments.  The Center also recruited Traverse CEO Scaduto as a  BioEntrepreneur-in-Residence.  The BioEntrepreneur-in-Residence program engages entrepreneurs to launch bioscience ventures in the Long Island region based on commercially promising biomedical technologies emerging from Stony Brook University. BioEntrepreneurs-in-Residence develop commercialization strategies, business plans, and investor presentations; negotiate and execute option and/or license agreements with the OTLIR; and seek and secure capital from both public and private sources.  The execution of the worldwide license agreement between Traverse Biosciences and the Research Foundation marks a significant milestone for the Center s expanding BioEntrepreneur-on-Residence Program,  says Clinton Rubin, Director of the New York State Center for Biotechnology at Stony Brook University.  This formal transfer of intellectual property demonstrates the commitment Stony Brook University and the Center for Biotechnology have to ensuring the innovation economy and entrepreneurial ecosystem in the region continues to develop, expand and thrive.  Traverse Biosciences received a $205,709 Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) award in partnership with the School of Dental Medicine at Stony Brook University to advance the technology. Funding from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will help evaluate the effectiveness of the lead drug candidate, TRB N0224, for the treatment of periodontal disease. The research will be led by Dr. Golub and Ying Gu, DDS, PhD, Associate Professor in the Department of General Dentistry, who will serve as co principle investigators on the award in collaboration with Traverse Biosciences.","Published: March 19, 2015"

Chemists at the University of Illinois, led by chemistry professor and medical doctor Martin D. Burke, built the machine to assemble complex small molecules at the click of a mouse, like a 3-D printer at the molecular level. The automated process has the potential to greatly speed up and enable new drug development and other technologies that rely on small molecules.  We wanted to take a very complex process, chemical synthesis, and make it simple,  said Burke, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Early Career Scientist.  Simplicity enables automation, which, in turn, can broadly enable discovery and bring the substantial power of making molecules to nonspecialists.  The researchers described the technology in a paper featured on the cover of the March 13 issue of Science.  Small molecules  are a specific class of complex, compact chemical structures found throughout nature. They are very important in medicine   most medications available now are small molecules   as well as in biology as probes to uncover the inner workings of cells and tissues. Small molecules also are key elements in technologies like solar cells and LEDs. However, small molecules are notoriously difficult to make in a lab. Traditionally, a highly trained chemist spends years trying to figure out how to make each one before its function can even be explored, a slowdown that hinders development of small-molecule-based medications and technologies.  Up to now, the bottleneck has been synthesis,  Burke said.  There are many areas where progress is being slowed, and many molecules that pharmaceutical companies aren t even working on, because the barrier to synthesis is so high.  The main question that Burke s group seeks to answer: How do you take something very complex and make it as simple as possible? The group s strategy has been to break down the complex molecules into smaller building blocks that can be easily assembled. The chemical building blocks all have the same connector piece and can be stitched together with one simple reaction, the way that a child s interconnecting plastic blocks can have different shapes but all snap together. Many of the building blocks Burke s lab has developed are available commercially. To automate the building-block assembly, Burke s group devised a simple catch-and-release method that adds one building block at a time, rinsing the excess away before adding the next one. They demonstrated that their machine could build 14 different classes of small molecules, including ones with difficult-to-manufacture ring structures, all using the same automated building-block assembly.  Dr. Burke s research has yielded a significant advance that helps make complex small molecule synthesis more efficient, flexible and accessible,  said Miles Fabian of the National Institutes of Health s National Institute of General Medical Sciences, which partially funded the research.  It is exciting to think about the impact that continued advances in these directions will have on synthetic chemistry and life science research.  The automated synthesis technology has been licensed to REVOLUTION Medicines, Inc., a company that Burke co-founded that focuses on creating new medicines based on small molecules found in nature. The company initially is focusing on anti-fungal medications, an area where Burke s research has already made strides.  It is expected that the technology will similarly create new opportunities in other therapeutic areas as well, as the industrialization of the technology will help refine and broaden its scope and scalability,  Burke said.  Perhaps most exciting, this work has opened up an actionable roadmap to a general and automated way to make most small molecules. If that goal can be realized, it will help shift the bottleneck from synthesis to function and bring the power of making small molecules to nonspecialists. ","Published: March 19, 2015"

Katherine A. Scott, Angus G. Dalgleish, and Wai M. Liu, who are affiliated with the Department of Oncology, Division of Clinical Sciences, St George s, University of London, studied the effects of  9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) both by themselves and in combination with radiation therapy on glioma cells in-vitro and on laboratory mice. Gliomas are a type of brain and spine cancer and are one of the most aggressive forms of cancer in humans. Gliomas takes its name from the glial cells of the brain and spine they originate in. Glial cells are the tissue that surrounds and supports neurons in the brain and spine, but the most glioma sites are in the brain. The researchers found a good dose combination of 7mM (millimolar - a measure of amount-of-substance concentration) each of THC and CBD to minimize the psychoactive effects of the THC and still maintain their anti-cancer effectiveness. The researchers found in order to achieve a 50% kill rate of the glioma cancer cells they would have had to use 19mM of THC or 14mM of CBD if they were used separately, so using THC and CBD together was more effective. The Results:The dose of radiation the researchers used had no dramatic effect on reducing tumor growth. The combination of THC and CBD without radiation was marginally more effective than radiation alone. The combination of THC, CBD, and radiation basically stopped tumor growth in the mice for the rest of the study. Tumor sizes were significantly smaller in these the mice that received this combination of therapy in comparison to the other mice that did not. The researchers noted that the combination of THC and CBD made the glioma cells more susceptible to the radiation because of an increase in markers of autophagy and apoptosis. John Dickson from Kustomvape an Edinburgh company that sells CBD eliquid said  The benefits of CBD are getting reported around the world, this report is unusually because it also included the use of THC which is the part of marijuana that gets you  high , so is not legally available in the UK. The consensus does seem to show that CBD is the most common beneficial marijuana compound with most benefits appearing when used alone and now in combination with THC.  Kustomvape have had many of their customers report benefits from using their CBD eliquid, for instance Mrs Scott who suffers from Fibromyalgia and can have pains all over her body reported that since vaping Kustom hemp eLiquids her pain has eased. Mrs Scott explained that the CBD eliquid relaxed her muscles giving her relief from the constant pain and said she would recommend that anyone should try Kustom CBD Hemp Oil.

According to a new study published in Nature, researchers have found a way to enhance the effects of this therapeutic approach in glioblastoma, a deadly type of brain cancer, and possibly improve patient outcomes. The research was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) as well as the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which are part of the National Institutes of Health.  The promise of dendritic cell-based therapy and other immunotherapies for brain cancer has been upheld for some time, but an important implication of this work is a demonstrated capacity to significantly improve the clinical impact of immunotherapy for patients with this very difficult disease,  said Duane A. Mitchell, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program at the University of Florida in Gainesville and co-lead author of the study. Dendritic cells are specialized immune cells that normally capture microorganisms, and then migrate to the lymph nodes to prepare other immune players, such as T cells, to fight off the invaders. Dendritic cells have been used for immunotherapy to target a variety of tumor types, including those that affect the brain. These cells are taken from the patient, engineered to express antigens from the tumor  to create a vaccine, and then injected back into the patient. Once in the patient, the engineered dendritic cells activate T cells, which can fight the tumor and also prevent it from coming back, via an immune memory response.  Dr. Mitchell and his colleagues wanted to know if increasing dendritic cell migration to lymph nodes would improve the effects of the vaccine. To test this idea, a group of glioblastoma patients was randomized to receive a tetanus booster shot before getting the tumor-antigen expressing dendritic cell vaccine. The booster was designed to set off an inflammatory response at the site of the vaccination, prepping the immune system for a larger battle. The other group of patients were injected with their own native dendritic cells instead of a tetanus shot, and then treated with the tumor-antigen expressing dendritic cell vaccine. Both sets of patients were treated with the vaccine which was being tested for effectiveness against glioblastoma.  The vaccine used in this study was targeted against cytomegalovirus (CMV). Studies have shown that CMV is found in glioblastoma tumors, but it is unclear if the virus causes tumors or contributes to disease progression. Glioblastomas are a devastating form of brain cancer with five year survival rates under 10 percent. From the time of diagnosis, average survival time is less than two years.  The role of CMV in glioblastoma has been a controversial area of research for several years. These new findings, and especially the dramatic survival rates, suggest that the virus may be an effective target for immune therapy. The results presented by Dr. Mitchell and his colleagues should stimulate more basic research on CMV and its potential therapeutic role in brain tumors and possibly other cancers,  said Jane Fountain, Ph.D., program director at the NINDS. The results showed that administering a tetanus booster before the vaccine increased dendritic cell migration to lymph nodes and also had a significant effect on clinical outcomes. The patients who received the tetanus booster lived more than 36.6 months after diagnosis compared to an average survival time of 18.5 months in those who received dendritic cells alone.  We did not expect that enhancing dendritic cell migration would be associated with such a dramatic improvement on clinical outcomes in our patients,  said Dr. Mitchell.  Next, the investigators used a mouse model to determine how the tetanus booster increased dendritic cell migration to the lymph nodes. The results suggested that giving a booster shot to mice that have received the tetanus vaccine activated a recall response in the exposed T cells. Acting through a chemical messenger known as CCL3, those T cells increased dendritic cell migration to the lymph nodes, which ultimately enhanced the effect of the dendritic cell vaccine on tumor growth suppression.  Dendritic cell vaccines targeting glioblastoma can be very effective by enhancing migration of dendritic cells. We now understand how we may improve outcomes for patients receiving this type of therapy,  said Dr. Mitchell. He added that larger clinical studies need to be conducted to confirm these results. In addition, more research is necessary to define the role of CMV in glioblastoma and further determine mechanisms to enhance efficacy of vaccines in cancer therapy.

The article, ""Actual Reality: Using the Internet to assess everyday functioning after traumatic brain injury,"" is published in Brain Injury. This is the first study examining the use of Actual Reality in the TBI population. Despite the scope of functional deficits in the population with TBI, few methods are available to adequately assess functional status during recovery. Current methods of assessing performance-based tasks are impractical, outdated or subjective (self report), and fail to include use of everyday technology. To achieve independence, it is increasingly important to be able to navigate the internet to find and share information, make purchases, and connect with the community. Today's rehabilitative strategies need to objectively address the technological demands of everyday life. Researchers looked at the feasibility of using everyday technology (computers, handheld devices) to assess how people perform the common technology-based tasks that are essential to everyday function, ie, instrumental ADLs. Actual Reality uses internet-based technology to assess a person's performance on 'instrumental' ADLs (iADLs). In this study, 10 people with TBI were compared with 10 controls. They were assessed for their ability to perform an Actual Reality task comprised of an online purchase of a cookie assortment for a birthday party. Participants were also assessed for prior internet experience, and underwent testing for functional status, affect symptomatology, and quality of life. The TBI group had greater difficulty performing the internet-based task. ""Our findings are consistent with studies that show a positive relationship between cognitive impairment and functional disability,"" said Dr. Goverover, visiting scientist in Neuropsychology & Neuroscience Research at Kessler Foundation. ""To help individuals achieve independence, rehabilitation professionals need the appropriate assessment tools to guide the development of practical interventions.

The study, conducted by Linda Smith, a professor in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, in collaboration with a roboticist from England and a developmental psychologist from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, offers a new approach to studying the way ""objects of cognition,"" such as words or memories of physical objects, are tied to the position of the body. ""This study shows that the body plays a role in early object name learning, and how toddlers use the body's position in space to connect ideas,"" Smith said. ""The creation of a robot model for infant learning has far-reaching implications for how the brains of young people work."" The research, ""Posture Affects How Robots and Infants Map Words to Objects,"" is published in PLoS One. Using both robots and infants, researchers examined the role bodily position played in the brain's ability to ""map"" names to objects. They found that consistency of the body's posture and spatial relationship to an object as an object's name was shown and spoken aloud were critical to successfully connecting the name to the object. The new insights stem from the field of epigenetic robotics, in which researchers are working to create robots that learn and develop like children, through interaction with their environment. Morse applied Smith s earlier research to creating a learning robot in which cognitive processes emerge from the physical constraints and capacities of its body. ""A number of studies suggest that memory is tightly tied to the location of an object,"" Smith said. ""None, however, have shown that bodily position plays a role or that, if you shift your body, you could forget."" To reach these conclusions, the study's authors conducted a series of experiments, first with robots programmed to map the name of an object to the object through shared association with a posture, then with children age 12 to 18 months. In one experiment, a robot was first shown an object situated to its left, then a different object to the right; then the process was repeated several times to create an association between the objects and the robot's two postures. Then with no objects in place, the robot's view was directed to the location of the object on the left and given a command that elicited the same posture from the earlier viewing of the object. Then the two objects were presented in the same locations without naming, after which the two objects were presented in different locations as their names were repeated. This caused the robot to turn and reach toward the object now associated with the name. The robot consistently indicated a connection between the object and its name during 20 repeats of the experiment. But in subsequent tests where the target and another object were placed in both locations -- so as to not be associated with a specific posture -- the robot failed to recognize the target object. When replicated with infants, there were only slight differences in the results: The infant data, like that of the robot, implicated the role of posture in connecting names to objects. ""These experiments may provide a new way to investigate the way cognition is connected to the body, as well as new evidence that mental entities, such as thoughts, words and representations of objects, which seem to have no spatial or bodily components, first take shape through spatial relationship of the body within the surrounding world,"" Smith said. Smith's research has long focused on creating a framework for understanding cognition that differs from the traditional view, which separates physical actions such as handling objects or walking up a hill from cognitive actions such as learning language or playing chess. Additional research is needed to determine whether this study's results apply to infants only, or more broadly to the relationship between the brain, the body and memory, she added. The study may also provide new approaches to research on developmental disorders in which difficulties with motor coordination and cognitive development are well-documented but poorly understood.

The study, which used a novel approach to map brain networks, was led by researchers at the Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute at CAMH and published in JAMA Psychiatry. ""Finding ways to help this particular group of people with schizophrenia is a priority as recovery is unlikely, even up to 20 years after the initial diagnosis. Social isolation, lack of work and relationships, and chronic disability are very common,"" says Dr. Aristotle Voineskos, senior author on the paper and Director of the Slaight Family Centre for Youth in Transition at CAMH. Schizophrenia, which affects one in 100 people, is generally known for symptoms of delusions and hallucinations, which can be treated with antipsychotic medications. However, lack of motivation and social withdrawal are also characteristic symptoms of the illness. These are known as negative symptoms. Approximately one in five people with schizophrenia experience these negative symptoms in a pronounced way, says lead author Dr. Anne Wheeler, CAMH post-doctoral fellow. At this point, there is no treatment for negative symptoms, yet they have the greatest impact on a person's daily functioning once the psychosis is managed. The value of having a biological, brain-based indicator is that it may help identify this group of patients when they initially present for treatment of psychosis. Otherwise it can take years to determine social disability through clinical observation, says Dr. Voineskos. The study involved magnetic resonance brain imaging (MRI) with 128 people with schizophrenia and 130 healthy individuals at two sites, and with 39 patients with bipolar disorder and 43 healthy individuals at a third site. Patients with bipolar disorder also experience psychotic symptoms but not negative symptoms, so these patients served as an additional comparison group. The three sites were at CAMH, the Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, New York, and the Central Institute of Mental Health in Mannheim, Germany. Researchers used a unique approach called network analysis to study the overall network density, or level of connectivity, in the brain. ""We found alterations in a number of relationships between brain regions among those with more severe schizophrenia compared with the other groups, including those with less severe schizophrenia,"" says Dr. Voineskos. ""This provides strong evidence that schizophrenia is not just one brain disorder."" The study also confirms previous research from his team showing changes in the white matter tissues connecting those same regions in the brain, among those with more severe schizophrenia. These impaired networks are important to the brain processes related to negative symptoms and social function that patients experience, the authors write. Based on these findings, the investigators are also funded by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health to conduct a multi-centre study of a large number of people with schizophrenia to establish the full range of impairment in brain circuitry that predicts social impairment. Through this research, specific brain circuits can be targeted to develop new therapeutic approaches for negative symptoms and social impairment.

MDMA was first synthesized by Merck as far back as 1912 as a potential appetite suppressant; however, the company never marketed it as such. In the 1970s and 1980s the substance surfaced on the recreational drug scene and its widespread abuse led many countries to prohibit the possession, supply and manufacture of MDMA. Currently, in the UK, MDMA is controlled as a Class A, Schedule 1 substance owing to its illicit use as a recreational drug, and its implication in a number of highly publicized fatalities. It is usually found in tableted form; the tableting procedure subjects the material to elevated pressures in which conversion to other polymorphs may occur. A group of scientists from Glasgow, Dundee and Manchester decided to investigate how MDMA behaves under such extreme pressure. Under ambient conditions MDMA is only observed in one orthorhombic polymorph. The scientists found there was no change in polymorph even to extremely high pressures, i.e. it is very unlikely that, if starting with this form of MDMA, a polymorphic transition would occur during tableting. The scientists mention that, owing to this being a single crystal study and the fact that pressure needed to be applied hydrostatically to the sample to obtain the 3-D information on the structure, one may find under non-hydrostatic conditions that a polymorphic change may indeed occur. The scientists intend to keep investigating illicit materials under various conditions of pressure and temperature to gain a better understanding of their solid-state chemistry.

Approximately one-third of patients are resistant to currently available therapies. A team of researchers under the guidance of the Institute of Cellular Neurosciences at the University of Bonn has discovered a new cause to explain the development of temporal lobe epilepsy: At an early stage, astrocytes are uncoupled from each other. This results in the extracellular accumulation of potassium ions and neurotransmitters, which cause hyperexcitability of the neurons. The results are published online in the journal ""Brain"". The print version will be published in May. Approximately two percent of the population suffers from epilepsy. ""Despite intense research efforts, the causes of this disease are still largely unclear,"" says Prof. Dr. Christian Steinh user, Director of the Institute of Cellular Neurosciences of the University of Bonn. Approximately one-third of patients are therapy-resistant. ""In some frequent forms such as temporal lobe epilepsy, this percentage is even significantly higher,"" says the researcher. For this reason, scientists are searching for new strategies in epilepsy research to develop new, more efficient therapeutic approaches. One such new approach in the research into causes of epilepsy has now been found by a team working with Prof. Steinh user. Together with neurosurgeons from the University of Bonn Hospital as well as epilepsy specialists from the Freiburg University Hospital, the Institute of Cellular Neurosciences of the University of Bonn investigated the functional properties of astrocytes. These are nervous system cells which belong to the glial cells. They were originally considered only to be ""glue"" holding the brain together, but in recent years, astrocytes have increasingly turned out to be an important partner to neurons. ""Epilepsy research is dominated by the assumption that altered properties of neurons cause epilepsy,"" says Prof. Steinh user. His working group has now demonstrated that malfunctions of glial cells play a crucial role in the development of epilepsy. Brain tissue removed from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy was observed by the researchers to be completely lacking in astrocytes. ""In this condition, no functional networks of coupled astrocytes can be formed,"" says first author Dr. Peter Bedner. Because astrocytic networks are missing, potassium ions and neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, which are important for signal transmission, can accumulate in this tissue. This leads to hyperexcitability of the affected neurons and ultimately to epileptic seizures. Is the loss of astrocytic coupling the cause of epilepsy or is this merely a consequence of hyperexcitability? To be able to address this question, the scientists specifically developed a mouse model which recapitulates key characteristics of temporal lobe epilepsy in humans. ""In this model, we were able to demonstrate that during the development of epilepsy, the coupling between the astrocytes is lost very early, and changes in the neurons are observed only later on,"" reports Prof. Steinh user. The scientists suspect that uncoupling of astrocytes is mediated by inflammation. The causes are likely so-called cytokines which are released in the brain by activated microglial cells or astrocytes. ""We were able to demonstrate that uncoupling of astrocytes - at least in the early stage of epilepsy - can be reversed,"" says Prof. Steinh user. The scientists now hope that their results from basic research will enable the development of new therapies to treat temporal lobe epilepsy. University of Bonn   press release P. Bedner, A.

This pest lays its eggs in fresh and ripening fruits before they are harvested. Infested fruits are often additionally infected with bacteria and fungi, and become unsuitable for sale and further processing. Currently, the only way to effectively control this pest insect is through the use of insecticides. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology have now identified a leaf odor which is highly attractive to Drosophila suzukii. Beta-cyclocitral lures the spotted-wing drosophila but no other related drosophilids. Researchers were able to measure the olfactory specialization of the insect to this leaf odor on the basis of the response of a certain sensillum. The spotted-wing drosophila Drosophila suzukii originated in Asia and belongs to the family of vinegar flies. Its relative is Drosophila melanogaster, the common vinegar fly, which is widespread in our regions and can be found in large numbers on overripe and rotting fruits in the summer months. Whereas D. melanogaster is a nuisance but not a real pest, D. suzukii can cause considerable damage in orchards and vineyards. Unlike the common vinegar fly, D. suzukii lays its eggs in healthy and ripening fruits before they are harvested. Often, fungi and bacteria are also transmitted. In 2011, the pest was first detected in Germany. In the summer and fall of 2014, for the first time, vineyard owners in Germany had to use insecticides to fight the pest. Vinegar traps for monitoring D. suzukii infestation are not really helpful as the traps attract other drosophilids, and checking whether D. suzukii has been trapped is very time-consuming. Ian Keesey and his colleagues in Bill Hansson s Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology wanted to find out if there is any odor which attracts only D. suzukii. At the center of their investigation was also the question of how D. suzukii developed its preference for fresh fruits and how this specialization could be traced physiologically in the insect s olfactory system. Behavioral assays revealed that this fly was considerably more attracted by leaf tissue than were all other tested fly species. The researchers therefore examined the responses of single sensory hairs (sensilla) in different drosophilids to a large variety of ecologically relevant odors, including many leaf odors. The coupling of sensory physiology (single-sensillum derivatives) and gas chromatography allows for the examination of individual sensilla, while numerous odors found in a fruit or a leaf are tested by means of gas chromatography simultaneously. By using this technique, the researcher identified a substance which attracted only D. suzukii, the leaf odor beta-cyclocitral. In addition, the pest insect also responded more strongly to odors that were emitted by the plant during early stages of fruit ripening and less strongly to substances found in fermenting fruits (such substances are often used as baits for vinegar flies). Interestingly, it is one single sensillum type, the so-called ab3 sensillum, that responds explicitly to this odor:  We were amazed that it was again the ab3 sensillum that showed specific responses. Whenever flies occupy a new food niche, the demands on their olfactory system change. They must be able to smell new odors and ignore smells that had been attractive in the past. It is the ab3 sensillum that changes its response spectrum,  Markus Knaden, leader of the project group  Odor-guided behavior in insects , explains. The ab3 sensillum seems to play a particularly important role when it comes to the insect s search for food or the best oviposition site. However, that D. suzukii is attracted by leaf tissue but nevertheless lays its eggs in ripening fruits is quite unusual. For oviposition, the females use their strikingly long and serrated ovipositor to pierce the skin of fruits and berries and deposit their eggs.  D. suzukii may act as an evolutionary bridge between fruit-centered and herbivorous species within the Drosophila family,  says Ian Keesey,  first author on the study. Ripening fruits and berries are mostly surrounded by leaves. Attracted by leaf odors, D. suzukii are automatically guided to the vicinity of fruits; visual cues may then help to finally pinpoint the fruits. By investigating D. suzukii s olfactory specialization, the scientists want to better understand why some insect species become pests, while others don t. In this case, they want to find out why and how this fly has specialized on ripening, healthy fruits and adapted its odor sensitivity accordingly. Their research results may help to develop more efficient traps in order to simplify Drosophila suzukii monitoring and to better keep this pest in check.","Published: March 18, 2015"

""Eric is the perfect person to direct this center. He is a world leader in the field of machine learning and an expert in computational biology and chemistry,"" Moore said. The CMLH will focus on five areas: big health care data analytics; personalized medicine and disease modeling; issues of preservation of privacy, security and compliance in the context of big data; data-driven patient and provider education and training; and a new general framework for big data in health care. ""We envision data-driven medicine based on the experience of many thousands of actual patients that will produce targeted, not generic, assessments of an individual's disease risk and make personalized recommendations for treatment,"" Xing said. Xing said a near-term project he envisions at the CMLH is the development of an automated patient diagnosis system. A doctor could query this system to determine possible diagnoses for a set of symptoms and lab findings. The system would search medical literature and analyze collections of patient data to provide possible diagnoses. The system could also suggest additional questions that the physician might ask the patient, or tests that might be ordered, to refine the diagnosis. The second center funded by UPMC is the Center for Commercial Applications and Global Healthcare Data at the University of Pittsburgh, which will research and invent new technology for developing individualized therapies for various diseases. Scientists from all three institutions will participate in each center. CMU, Pitt and UPMC have a long history of successful collaboration at the intersection of health and data science. For example, the use of smart data to help hospitals and doctors rapidly detect potential disease outbreaks and immediately alert staff and authorities to take appropriate actions is the focus of the Real-Time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) Laboratory at Pitt. Moore was a collaborator in this project as a CMU professor. A similar approach is taken at the Event and Pattern Detection (EPD) Lab at CMU's Heinz College. At EPD, Pitt and CMU collaborated on a project to detect disease outbreak by tracking over-the-counter medication sales. A current EPD Lab project, funded by UPMC, is developing a framework for using large data sets, including electronic health records and insurance claims, to uncover patterns of care that have significant potential impacts on patient outcomes from mortality, to length of hospital stay and frequency of readmission. The new research centers at CMU and Pitt will be funded with 10 to 20 million dollars per year over the next six years by UPMC and also will benefit from several hundred million dollars in existing research grants at all three institutions. The alliance goal is to streamline and accelerate the process of moving innovations from discovery to real-world application. UPMC Enterprises, the commercialization arm of UPMC, will lead the efforts to turn these innovative ideas into new, for-profit companies and jobs. ""Not only will this effort benefit patients, but it will also accelerate Pittsburgh's revitalization,"" said UPMC CEO Jeffrey Romoff. Moore knows something about economic development and the impact of innovation at CMU.  He was a CMU professor in 2006 when Google tapped him to start the Google Pittsburgh Lab at the university. The Google operation began with a handful of employees at the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center on CMU's campus. This facility houses numerous companies, such as Apple and Disney, who have established a footprint at CMU to pursue collaboration opportunities and tap into CMU's world-class research and development capabilities. Google now employs hundreds of software engineers and has been the anchor for the Bakery Square development in East Liberty, now in its second phase.  This in turn has resulted in new housing, retail and service providers that have transformed this once blighted neighborhood into one of the city's most coveted destinations. Moore said he expects new industry partners will want to locate near CMU and Pitt to participate in the research and development at the Data Alliance's new research centers.","Published: March 18, 2015"

Now, researchers at The Wistar Institute have discovered one way in which melanoma becomes resistant to a particular form of targeted therapy, and understanding this phenomenon may lead to a new melanoma target or prompt new designs of these treatments. The findings were published by the journal Clinical Cancer Research. When targeted therapies were first approved for the treatment of cancer, they were hailed as a potential  cure  for different types of cancers and an acceptable alternative to chemotherapy, since they were designed to target the mutations responsible for cancer while sparing healthy, unmutated cells. In the case of melanoma, the gene BRAFV600E/K seemed like a particularly promising target, since the gene is mutated in approximately 40 to 50 percent of all cases of melanoma. However, while patients with these mutations who receive drugs designed to target BRAF mutations do live slightly longer, they often relapse within several months of treatment.  We once thought targeted therapies could be a  magic bullet  for cancer treatment, but we ve learned over time that this simply is not the case, especially with regard to BRAF inhibitors for melanoma,  said Russel E. Kaufman, M.D., president emeritus of The Wistar Institute and lead author of the study.  We felt it was important to examine the tumor microenvironment to provide one possible explanation for why patients become resistant to targeted therapy in order to guide treatment decisions and perhaps arrive at better, more effective therapies.  Kaufman and his research team decided to focus on macrophages, a type of white blood cell that has been nicknamed  Pac Man  by immunologists because it goes around and  eats  various types of cellular debris, similar to the arcade character. Macrophages are the most abundant inflammatory cell in melanomas, and their presence is inversely correlated with patient outcome at all stages of the disease. Melanoma-associated macrophages have been linked to cancer progression in a number of ways, but their role in resistance to BRAF inhibitors had not been properly defined prior to this study. Melanoma cells and macrophages were evaluated by using an in vitro cell coculture system and a number of analytic procedures to determine levels of cancer proliferation and cell death. The researchers also used two mouse preclinical models to determine whether using macrophages as targets can actually increase the effectiveness of BRAF inhibitors. The researchers found that BRAF inhibitors activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in macrophages. This pathway is used by cells to help receptors on the surface of the cell communicate with the DNA inside of the cell to produce proteins. In this case, the activation of the pathway leads to the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a signaling protein closely associated with tumor growth because it promotes the formation of blood vessels that the tumors need to survive. VEGF produced in the macrophages in turn activates the MAPK pathway in melanoma cells, thereby stimulating the growth of cancer cells. With this information, the researchers discovered that blocking the MAPK pathway or VEGF signaling appears to reverse macrophage-mediated resistance. Targeting macrophages also increased the antitumor activity of BRAF inhibitors in mouse and human tumor models. Conversely, the presence of macrophages in melanomas was able to predict earlier relapse after treatment.  This study gives us important insight into the off-target effects these inhibitors can have on patients,  Kaufman said.  With this piece of information, we have determined just how important one of these off-target effects can be, and from here, we can decide whether the right approach is to target the macrophages themselves or to design new BRAF-inhibiting drugs that do not activate macrophages.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/surprising-finding-in-stroke-research-210823,Surprising Finding In Stroke Research Scientists at The University of Manchester have made an important new discovery about the brain s immune system that could lead to potential new treatments for stroke and other related conditions  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Inflammation is activated in the brain after a stroke, but rather than aiding recovery it actually causes and worsens damage. That damage can be devastating. In fact, stroke is responsible for 10% of deaths worldwide and is the leading cause of disability.  Therefore, understanding how inflammation is regulated in the brain is vital for the development of drugs to limit the damage triggered by a stroke. Dr David Brough from the Faculty of Life Sciences, working alongside colleagues including Professors Dame Nancy Rothwell and Stuart Allan, has studied the role of inflammasomes in stroke. These inflammasomes are large protein complexes essential for the production of the inflammatory protein interleukin-1. Interleukin-1 has many roles in the body, and contributes to cell death in the brain following a stroke. Dr Brough explains:  Very little is known about how inflammasomes might be involved in brain injury. Therefore we began by studying the most well researched inflammasome NLRP3, which is known to be activated when the body is injured. Surprisingly we found that this was not involved in inflammation and damage in the brain caused by stroke, even though drugs are being developed to block this to treat Alzheimer s disease.  Further studies using experimental models of stroke demonstrated that it was actually the NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes that contribute to brain injury, rather than NLRP3.  This discovery was unexpected, since NLRC4, was only known to fight infections and yet Dr Brough and colleagues found that it caused injury in the brain. This new discovery will help the Manchester researchers discover more about how inflammation is involved in brain injury and develop new drugs for the treatment of stroke.  The research was funded by the Wellcome Trust and Medical Research Council and has been published in PNAS. As well as identifying new targets for potential drug treatments for stroke Dr Brough points out how little we currently know about how the immune system works in the brain. He says:  We know very little about how the immune system is regulated in the brain. However, its important we understand this since it contributes to disease and injury. For example, in addition to stroke, Alzheimer s disease has an inflammatory aspect and even depression may be driven by inflammation. ","Published: March 18, 2015"

The wearable biosensor will aid researchers, clinicians, therapists and individuals by providing more accurate data on how much an individual is drinking. NIAAA is part of the National Institutes of Health. The winning prototype is expected to improve on existing technology by providing real-time monitoring in an inconspicuous package appealing to the general public. Presently, the biosensor bracelets commonly used in the criminal justice system are effective but cumbersome and only take readings every 30 minutes. NIAAA is looking for innovation using a non-invasive design, which could take the form of jewelry, clothing, or another format located in contact with the body. The device must be able to measure blood alcohol level, interpret and store the data, or transmit it to a smartphone or other device by wireless transmission.  This project is designed to stimulate investment from public and private sectors in the development of improved alcohol biosensors that will be appealing to researchers, treatment providers and individuals,  said George F. Koob, Ph.D., director of NIAAA. A number of medical conditions are exacerbated by alcohol, including liver disease and HIV/AIDS. Research that seeks to understand the progression of these diseases and potential treatments depends on the ability to accurately measure alcohol use. Wearable alcohol biosensors will simplify the process for scientists, study participants, therapists and individuals. Well-calibrated alcohol biosensors will provide an objective measure, while participants will be able to avoid the inconvenience and discomfort of having blood drawn at regular intervals. The data collected would also be more accurate than self-report.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/no-humans-required-203677,No Humans Required Automated tool for tracking proteins and the molecules they interact with in living cells developed  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Match-making used to be a laborious task. People would fill in forms describing themselves and the kind of person they were looking for, and then someone would manually try to find a suitable date among other archived singletons. Today it s all much quicker and easier: you just complete your profile online and computer algorithms do all the hard work of finding your dream partner. Biologists looking for the partners that a given protein naturally has in the cell are on the edge of a similar technical revolution. There are many tools available for this task, but like the match-making methods of old they can be time-consuming and take a lot of effort. The new approach, which is reported in Nature Biotechnology, provides an automated tool for scientists to track proteins and the molecules they interact with in living cells. Such studies provide clues about how the cell s proteins connect with each other to carry out crucial functions like cell division. They can also shed light on what goes wrong in disease, and which proteins could be useful drug targets for pharmaceutical treatments. The new approach comes from work by Malte Wachsmuth, Christian Conrad and colleagues in the laboratory of Jan Ellenberg, Head of the Cell Biology and Biophysics Unit, who teamed up with Rainer Pepperkok and the Advanced Light Microscopy Facility at EMBL Heidelberg to develop new software that automates a powerful but previously slow technique called fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). In a standard FCS study, scientists label molecules of interest within the cell   specific proteins, for example   with a fluorescent tag. The cell is then placed under a microscope, and a laser is shone on the sample, causing the tag to emit light of a specific colour, such as green or red. Typically, the laser is focused on a tiny volume within the cell so that only a few light-emitting molecules are visible at any one time. FCS allows scientists to see how quickly these molecules pass through this small volume, or whether one labelled molecule is usually present together with other proteins labelled with a different colour. From this data, they can work out the rough size of molecules, and which other proteins they bind to, among other properties. What s made FCS slow in the past is that a human operator has had to identify a suitable cell to examine in detail, focus the microscope to zoom in on a small area, and then record a single-pixel movie   before repeating the process with another cell. After all this, the data have to be analysed mathematically to work out the properties of the molecules under study.  It s very labour-intensive, and that s a major issue , says Wachsmuth. The software developed by Wachsmuth and colleagues takes the human out of this equation and speeds up the process enormously. Whereas before a scientist could spend a whole day observing a single protein in a few cells, the automated process can analyse thousands of cells in the same time. To do so, cells are placed in a multi-well plate, with each well containing hundreds of cells laid out on a grid. The microscope peers down at a well, and the software identifies cells suitable for further analysis. It then automatically re-programs the microscope to zoom in a specific portion of the cell   a tiny part of the nucleus, for example. After recording what s happening in this region, the microscope zooms out, looks for another cell, and starts over again. Not only does the software automate the collection of data, it also processes them to calculate the various properties of interest to researchers.  In the past, the analysis of FCS data has been as tedious as acquiring the data,  says Wachsmuth. To show that the new automated approach works, Wachsmuth and colleagues carried out two biological proof-of-principle studies. In one, they tagged chromatin, a protein component of chromosomes, with a red fluorescent tag, and then labelled 53 other proteins with green tags. By focusing on the nucleus, and looking for the co-movement of red and green proteins, the team were able to identify which of the proteins bound to chromatin. In the second study, the team looked at two proteins that have been proposed to bind to each other during cell division. These proteins were labelled with red and green fluorescent tags, respectively, and then followed over the course of the cell cycle.  Nobody had ever shown that they really interact in a living cell, or when during the cell cycle they form a pair , says Wachsmuth. By revealing when red and green proteins moved together (indicating that they are bound together) or on their own, the automated FCS approach revealed how the concentrations of these proteins fluctuated across the cell cycle, and when they came together to do their job. This automated, high-throughput method will enable scientists to study many different proteins in a single experiment and see how they interact to form complex networks, which is essential for understanding how cells function.

The bacteria and viruses that cause acute gastroenteritis often come from contaminated food or water and result in cramps, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. In medical terms, these pathogens fall under the heading of  human enteric disease,  and while they may be common, they can also be deadly. Diarrheal diseases still account for about 17 percent of worldwide human deaths each year, and they are the second-leading killer of children 5 and younger. One roadblock to studying enteric pathogens like human rotaviruses and E. coli is that the organisms behave differently in humans than they do in animals typically used in medical research. Stem cell research has led to recent breakthroughs in the development of more realistic cell culture models, but there s room for improvement.  Infectious-disease labs that study enteric disease need better models that faithfully simulate the physiology of the intestine,  Rice tissue engineering researcher Jane Grande-Allen, the Isabel C. Cameron Professor of Bioengineering.  This organ contains multiple types of cells that are arranged in complex patterns, and these tissues are constantly on the move. They contract and expand all the time, and we suspect some pathogens take advantage of that motion to mount their attacks.  Thanks to a $5.1 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, Grande-Allen and colleagues at Baylor and MD Anderson are embarking on a five-year program to create a bioreactor that more closely simulates the complex tissues and dynamic movements of the intestinal track.  This kind of problem can only be solved with teamwork because it requires expertise in enteric disease, cell biology, tissue engineering, bioreactor design and more,  said Baylor s Mary Estes, the Cullen Chair of Molecular and Human Virology and principal investigator on the grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  No single institution has all of that expertise, but thanks to the resources in the Texas Medical Center, we have assembled a team that is uniquely qualified to meet this challenge.  Grande-Allen s lab will work with Baylor s Mary Dickinson, the Morrow Chair in Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, to create a platform that will allow cultures to be mechanically stimulated and that will promote cell differentiation and tissue patterning. Other research teams will work on creating enteroid cultures, tests involving infectious pathogens and identifying commensal gut bacteria, or probiotics, that may help fend off common pathogens like rotavirus and E. coli. Grande-Allen said the team s five-year goal is to deliver a simple, easy-to-use and relatively inexpensive system that could be easily implemented by any infectious disease lab. Other members of the research team include, from Baylor, Sarah Blutt, Anthony Maresso, Joseph Petrosino and Noah Shroyer and, from MD Anderson, Pablo Okhuysen.","Published: March 18, 2015"

Professors Duncan Bassett and Graham Williams are Endocrinologists at Imperial College London and Consultant Physicians at the Hammersmith Hospital specializing in Metabolic Bone Disease and Thyroid Disease respectively. They are also the Principal Investigators in the Molecular Endocrinology Laboratory in the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London. Their current research focuses on the molecular basis of bone and cartilage disease (www.boneandcartilage.com). These studies have identified new genetic determinants of bone mass and strength. In addition, they have a longstanding interest in thyroid hormone action and the role of thyroid hormone in both skeletal development and the maintenance of adult bone. These studies have clarified the complex relationship between central and peripheral thyroid status and identified a critical role for local thyroid hormone metabolism in bone. Back scattered electron-scanning electron microscopy (BSE-SEM) imaging is used in both the bone and joint phenotyping platforms. The goal of the research is to identify genetic determinants of bone and cartilage disorders. Describing his choice of detector, Professor Bassett said  We have used the Deben/KE developments detector on our collaborators microscope for more than 10 years. When we purchased our own TESCAN SEM last year, we wanted to continue to use the best BSE detector available, the Gen5. We particularly like the large detector size with its four quadrant configuration. This delivers an excellent signal to noise ratio.  Performance of the detector is illustrated in these two images which show an example of a trabecular bone. The left hand BSE-SEM image shows osteoclast resorption and osteocyte lacunae in trabecular bone. The intricate and delicate network of canals that connect the osteocyte lacunae can also be seen as black holes and dark lines on the bone surface. On the right, in this version of the image, data from three individual quadrants are coloured red, green and blue and combined to enhance appreciation of topographical information.","Published: March 18, 2015"

This is less expensive and invasive than current polysomnography (PSG) technology, according to a new study published in PLOS One. ""One of the main goals of sleep medicine today is to improve early diagnosis and treatment of the 'flood"" of subjects presenting with sleep disorders,"" says Prof. Yaniv Zigel Ph.D., head of the Biomedical Signal Processing Research Lab in BGU's Department of Biomedical Engineering. ""We've developed a non-contact 'breathing sound analysis' algorithm that provides a reliable estimation of whole-night sleep evaluation for detection of sleep quality, snoring severity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). It has the potential to reduce the cost and management of sleep disorders compared to PSG, the current standard of treatment, and could be used at home."" PSG requires a full night sleep center stay and subjects are connected to numerous electrodes and sensors that are attached to the patient to acquire signals and data from electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiography (ECG) tests. The data is processed and visually examined or mathematically transformed manually in order to reveal insights about sleep/wake states and many aspects of physiology. ""This procedure is time-consuming, tedious and costly due to complexity and the need for technical expertise; the market is begging for a better solution,"" says Eliran Dafna who conducted this study as part of his Ph.D. research. In the study, the researchers measured whole-night breathing sounds from 150 patients using both ambient microphones and PSG simultaneously at a sleep laboratory. The system was trained on 80 subjects and a validation study was blindly performed on the additional 70 subjects. A set of acoustic features quantifying breathing patterns was developed to distinguish between sleep and wake segments. Sleep quality parameters were calculated based on the sleep/wake classifications and compared with PSG for validity. When comparing sleep quality parameters, there were only minor average differences in the measurements between PSG and BSA. Measuring 150,000 individual time segments (epochs), the BSA epoch-by-epoch accuracy rate for the validation study was 83.3 percent with 92.2 percent sensitivity measuring sleep as sleep. ""The results showed that sleep/wake activity and sleep quality parameters can be reliably estimated solely using breathing sound analysis,"" says Prof. Ariel Tarasiuk of BGU's Department of Physiology and head of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Unit, at Soroka University Medical Center.

Circadian rhythms are generated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) located within the hypothalamus of the brain, but researchers had previously been unable to pinpoint which of the many thousands of neurons in the region were involved in controlling the body s timekeeping mechanisms.  We have found that a group of SCN neurons that express a neuropeptide called neuromedin S (NMS) is both necessary and sufficient for the control of circadian rhythms,  said Dr. Joseph Takahashi, Chairman of Neuroscience and Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator at UT Southwestern, who holds the Loyd B. Sands Distinguished Chair in Neuroscience. The findings, published in the journal Neuron, may offer important targets for future treatments of diseases and problems related to circadian dysfunction, which range from jet lag and sleep disorders to neurological problems such as Alzheimer s disease, as well as metabolism issues and psychiatric disorders such as depression. Key studies in the 1970s revealed that the SCN communicates and coordinates cells throughout the body to control circadian rhythms, but the SCN contains many neurons with different expression patterns of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters.  Which of these neurons are responsible for producing circadian rhythms was a major unanswered question in neurobiology. This study marks a significant advancement in our understanding of the body clock  said senior author Dr. Masashi Yanagisawa, Adjunct Professor of Molecular Genetics, former HHMI Investigator at UT Southwestern, and current Director of the World Premier International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. NMS is a neuropeptide   a protein made of amino acids that neurons, which are cells in the brain, use to communicate. Researchers created unique mouse models to determine that NMS-expressing neurons act as cellular pacemakers to regulate circadian rhythms. Specifically, the research team found that modulating the internal clock in just the NMS neurons altered the circadian period throughout the whole animal. In addition, the study provided new insights into the mechanisms by which light synchronizes body clock rhythms. Dr. Takahashi identified and cloned the first mammalian gene   called Clock related to circadian rhythms. Since then, the Takahashi lab has determined that disruptions in the Clock and Bmal1 genes in mice can alter the release of insulin by the pancreas, resulting in diabetes, and they determined the 3-D structure of the CLOCK-BMAL1 protein complex, which are considered to be the batteries of the biological clock. Dr. Yanagisawa first identified the important role that endothelin plays on the cardiovascular system, and later, with his discovery of orexin, showed that sleep/wakefulness is controlled by a single neuropeptide. His lab has since identified numerous receptors involved in the regulation of appetite and blood pressure, as well as other neuropeptides that play an important role in the regulation of energy metabolism, stress responses, emotions, and other functions.

Quite simply, the very act of remembering may be one of the major reasons why we forget. The research, published in Nature Neuroscience, is the first to isolate the adaptive forgetting mechanism in the human brain. The brain imaging study shows that the mechanism itself is implemented by the suppression of the unique cortical patterns that underlie competing memories. Via this mechanism, remembering dynamically alters which aspects of our past remain accessible. Dr. Maria Wimber, from the University of Birmingham, explained, ""Though there has been an emerging belief within the academic field that the brain has this inhibitory mechanism, I think a lot of people are surprised to hear that recalling memories has this darker side of making us forget others by actually suppressing them."" Patterns of brain activity in the participants were monitored by MRI scans while they were asked to recall individual memories based on images they had been shown earlier. The team, co-led by Dr Michael Anderson from the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit Cambridge, were able to track the brain activity induced by individual memories and show how this suppressed others by dividing the brain into tiny 3-dimensional voxels. Based on the fine-grained activation patterns of these voxels, the researchers were able to witness the neural fate of individual memories as they were reactivated initially, and subsequently suppressed. Over the course of four selective retrievals the participants in the study were cued to retrieve a target memory, which became more vivid with each trial. Competing memories were less well reactivated as each trial was carried out, and indeed were pushed below baseline expectations for memory, supporting the idea that an active suppression of memory was taking place. Dr. Anderson said ""People are used to thinking of forgetting as something passive. Our research reveals that people are more engaged than they realize in shaping what they remember of their lives. The idea that the very act of remembering can cause forgetting is surprising, and could tell us more about selective memory and even self deception."" Dr. Wimber continued, ""Forgetting is often viewed as a negative thing, but of course, it can be incredibly useful when trying to overcome a negative memory from our past. So there are opportunities for this to be applied in areas to really help people."" The team note that being able to decode how the brain goes about suppressing competing information needs to be acknowledged in a number of situations; not least in the judicial process. Dr. Wimber said, ""It has significance for anything that relies on memory, but a really good example is that of eyewitness testimonies. When a witness is asked to recall specific information about an event, and they are quizzed time and time again, it could well be to the detriment of associated memories -- giving the impression that their memory is sketchy. In fact, the repeated recall is causing them to forget these details."" The findings of this research are not restricted to specific memory types. Semantic memory, episodic memory and even recently acquired short-term memories are impacted by the forgetful side effect of frequent recall. Though people differ genetically, it is believed that all brains are capable of inducing varying degrees of this forgetting mechanism. Studying the neural basis of forgetting has proven challenging in the past because the 'engram', that is, the unique neural fingerprint that an experience leaves in our memory, has been difficult to pinpoint in brain activity. By capitalizing on the relationship between perception and memory, the study detected neural activity caused by the activation of individual memories, giving a unique window into the invisible neurocognitive processes triggered when a reminder recapitulates several competing memories.

The research targeted diabetic peripheral neuropathy, the most common complication of diabetes, affecting as many as 70 percent of patients. The study was recently published in PLOS ONE. Lei Wang, M.D., the Henry Ford neuroscientist who led the research, said that although numerous drugs have been shown to be effective in earlier animal experiments, most have not provided benefits in clinical trials. ""Generally, young diabetic animals with an early stage of peripheral neuropathy are used to investigate various drug treatments,"" Dr. Wang explains. ""But patients with diabetes who are enrolled in clinical trials often are older and have advanced peripheral neuropathy. ""Failure to develop and properly evaluate treatments in the laboratory that properly reflect the target clinical population with diabetic peripheral neuropathy may contribute to the failure of clinical trials."" To mimic clinical trials in which diabetes patients have advanced peripheral neuropathy, the Henry Ford researchers chose male mice with type II diabetes that were 36 weeks old, roughly equivalent to middle age in humans. Earlier animal experiments from the Henry Ford group showed that sildenafil, commonly known by the brand name Viagra, improved blood supply to the sciatic nerve. In addition, it was noted that diabetes patients who took Viagra for erectile dysfunction had fewer symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. However, it was not known if this therapeutic effect held true for long-term peripheral neuropathy because the diabetic mice used in the previous experiments were relatively young -- 16 weeks old. So the Henry Ford researchers chose diabetic mice that were more than twice as old. In one group, 15 such mice were treated with an oral dose of sildenafil every day for eight weeks. A control group of 15 age-matched diabetic mice were treated daily with the same amount of saline. After a battery of nerve and function tests were performed on both the drug-treated and control groups, results ""revealed that sildenafil markedly improved sensory function starting at six weeks after treatment compared with saline-treated diabetic mice,"" Dr. Wang says. ""These data indicate that sildenafil improves neurological function even in middle-aged mice with long-term diabetic peripheral neuropathy."" While stressing that the findings remain experimental, Dr. Wang says they provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of long-term diabetic nerve damage and may lead to the development of a sildenafil treatment for long-term diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is particularly insidious because, as it progresses and damages nerves in extremities and other parts of the body, many patients are unaware of it because pain sensors are numbed. As a result, a cut or sore on the bottom of a foot, for instance, may not be noticed until an infection sets in and spreads, possibly leading to amputation or even death. Because diabetic neuropathy results from chronically high blood sugar levels, diabetes patients are strongly encouraged to closely monitor those levels and control them through diet. Over-the-counter and prescription drugs -- including antidepressants and opiates -- are available to treat neuropathy pain, but often have undesirable side effects.

Writing in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers revealed an improved way to study genes in mosquitoes using a genome-editing method known as CRISPR-Cas9, which exploded onto the life science scene in 2012. Editing the genome of an organism allows scientists to study it by deleting certain genes to observe how the organism is affected, or even to add new genes. The new technique makes the editing process more efficient and may accelerate efforts to develop novel mosquito-control or disease-prevention strategies. ""We've cut the human capital it takes to evaluate genes in disease-carrying mosquitoes by a factor of 10,"" said Zach N. Adelman, an associate professor of entomology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and a member of the Fralin Life Science Institute. ""Not a lot of research groups have the resources to spend four months working with up to 5,000 mosquito embryos to investigate a gene that may ultimately have no bearing on their work. Now they can potentially do the same investigation in a week."" Mosquitoes transmit pathogens that cause malaria, dengue fever, and other high-impact diseases. In 2013, Malaria killed an estimated 584,000 people, most of them young children, according to the World Health Organization. Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft and a philanthropist who supports social and health causes, has called the mosquito the world's deadliest animal. ""The mosquito is incredibly important as far as transmission of disease,"" said Kevin M. Myles, an associate professor of entomology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and a member of the Fralin Life Science Institute. ""With this model, any scientist asking a question about a mosquito phenotype can now find its genetic cause. That's important for basic research into mosquito biology and applied research to control disease-vector mosquitoes."" The scientific community has long rallied to fight mosquito-borne diseases. ""I am excited by the paper,"" said Laura C. Harrington, a professor and the chairwoman of entomology at Cornell University, who was not involved in the research. ""We are desperately in need of faster and more efficient ways to transform mosquitoes. This single hurdle is holding the entire field back from making the discoveries that will lead to novel and effective approaches to mosquito and, consequently, disease control."" When CRISPR arrived in 2012, it drastically reduced the time it took for researchers to rewrite an organism's DNA. Medical and life scientists quickly saw the technique's potential to edit disease-causing genes in people or, in the case of mosquito research, strategically modify the genome of an animal known to carry parasites and viruses that cause malaria, dengue fever, and other high-impact diseases. But natural repair mechanisms are triggered when damage occurs in the mosquito genome, reducing opportunities for new sequences to be inserted in to the genome to help scientists to evaluate the genes. Adelman, Myles, and colleagues overcame this obstacle by developing a process that silences an important mosquito DNA repair mechanism, ensuring that the introduced changes are more likely to become a permanent part of the mosquito genome, and thus increasing opportunities to figure out the new gene's role in mosquito biology. ""I use genome editing to understand how mosquitoes find their hosts and ultimately to design new repellants and attractants to manipulate mosquito behavior,"" said Matthew DeGennaro, an assistant professor with the Biomolecular Sciences Institute at Florida International University, who was not involved in the research. ""For me, this study shows that the CRISPR system is robust in mosquitoes. The researchers also improved the technique to increase the probability of precise insertion of DNA, making CRISPR more useful."" Postdoctoral associates Sanjay Basu, Azadeh Aryan, and Glady Samuel, research technician Michelle Anderson, and Justin Overcash, a Ph.D. student from Blacksburg, Virginia, all with the Department of Entomology at Virginia Tech, contributed to the research. Timothy Dahlem, director of the Mutation Generation and Detection Core at the University of Utah, provided expertise and DNA nucleases to target specific genes. The project was supported by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

QIAGEN also announced a new partnership with Tokai Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to combine this new CTC technology with a molecular assay to co-develop and commercialize a companion diagnostic for Tokai s novel drug compound galeterone, which is in late-stage clinical trials for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The non-invasive test will determine the expression of the AR-V7 biomarker, which in recent studies has demonstrated potential utility to guide therapy choice in CRPC patients. Financial terms for the AdnaGen acquisition and the Tokai partnership were not disclosed.  We are pleased to expand QIAGEN s industry-leading pipeline as we pioneer the emerging field of non-invasive liquid biopsies. The innovative CTC detection method developed by the AdnaGen team and utilized as part of a novel diagnostic approach by thought leaders at Johns Hopkins University adds important new capabilities to our leadership position in liquid biopsy-based molecular diagnostics. Our partnership with Tokai Pharmaceuticals, one of the collaborations which we are pursuing with pharma in this area, is expected to result in such a liquid biopsy, CTC-based companion diagnostic, with potential to enhance outcomes for prostate cancer patients,  said Peer M. Schatz, Chief Executive Officer of QIAGEN.  Following the success of the first-ever regulated companion diagnostic for solid tumors based on molecular biomarkers from a liquid biopsy in Europe, we are expanding our portfolio of highly accurate tests that analyze samples of body fluids that are non-invasive and more accessible than traditional tissue biopsies. Our liquid biopsy portfolio holds potential to create valuable insights and improve outcomes for patients.  Circulating tumor cells are pivotal to understand the biology of cancer and its metastasis and hold great promise as specimens to help guide treatment decisions, evaluate disease burden and monitor tumor progression. However, due to the scarce amounts of CTCs in blood, their enrichment and characterization represent a major technological challenge. The proprietary technology from AdnaGen allows a complete solution for the detection and analysis of CTCs for clinical applications. It enriches disease specific tumor cells using magnetic particles in an antibody mixture, an approach called immunomagnetic cell enrichment, then isolates and purifies messenger RNA (mRNA) for analysis using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A substantial part of AdnaGen s portfolio was already being built on and marketed for recommended use with QIAGEN s automation platforms and consumable kits. QIAGEN s leading portfolio of solutions for pre-analytical processing of molecular biomarkers from blood and other fluids can support customers with liquid biopsies for a wide range of needs:   Cell-free, circulating nucleic acids (cfDNA), which come predominantly from dying cells released into the blood and other body fluids. This phenomenon occurs in every person, but some physiological states and symptom constellations are associated with a significantly higher concentration, for example in pregnant women or patients with cancers or autoimmune disorders.  Nucleic acids and proteins circulating in tiny enclosures called exosomes: These microvesicles (very small enclosures) are being shed by cells as part of a biological communication system. Each exosome can carry a tiny cargo of genetic instructions in the form of DNA and RNA molecules through the blood, urine or other fluids. Taking these genomic messages from cell to cell in the body, exosomes are being called the ""Twitter of the cells.""  Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enter the bloodstream from the primary tumor and play an important role in the development of metastases in other parts of the body. The partnership with Tokai Pharmaceuticals will leverage the CTC-based liquid biopsy technology for companion diagnostics. It aims to commercialize the first regulated, CTC-based companion diagnostic which is designed to guide the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with galeterone. Tokai s oral small molecule has received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is expected to enter phase III clinical trials in the first half of 2015, using QIAGEN s AR-V7 assay in development. The diagnostic test to be paired with galeterone will measure RNA expression in CTCs to detect a biomarker known as androgen-receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7), which has been demonstrated to predict poor responsiveness to certain oral therapies for metastatic CRPC. It will run on QIAGEN's Rotor-Gene Q MDx detection platform, a member of the QIAsymphony family of automated instruments.  We are pleased to be expanding our partnership with QIAGEN to support the continued development of the AR-V7 companion diagnostic that will be used in our 148 patient Phase 3 ARMOR3-SV trial of our lead product, galeterone. We believe that in the future, the availability of this non-invasive AR-V7 companion diagnostic will allow prostate cancer patients and physicians to make informed decisions for their care,  stated Jodie Morrison, President and Chief Executive Officer of Tokai Pharmaceuticals.  QIAGEN s experience in commercializing regulatory-approved companion diagnostics around the world addresses a key part of our strategy for bringing galeterone to market for CRPC patients globally.  Prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed malignancy among men. An estimated 1.1 million cases were diagnosed worldwide in 2012 and 300,000 patients died, according to the World Health Organization. In Europe, prostate cancer struck about 400,000 men and claimed 92,000 lives in 2012. The American Cancer Society predicts more than 220,000 new cases of prostate cancer in the United States in 2015, with 27,000 fatalities, making it the No. 2 cause of cancer deaths in American men. The CTC test for Tokai will be developed by QIAGEN Manchester, the global center for the development and regulatory approval of QIAGEN s molecular diagnostic applications. QIAGEN acquired certain technology and other assets from AdnaGen GmbH, a subsidiary of Alere Inc., including the CE-IVD marked products AdnaTest BreastCancer and AdnaTest Prostate Cancer, which are already marketed in Europe and offer improved treatment monitoring and earlier detection of tumor relapse. Leadership in liquid biopsies and personalized healthcare QIAGEN is at the forefront of offering liquid biopsy-based tests and isolation and enrichment technologies that target molecular biomarkers circulating in blood and other body fluids. Liquid biopsies hold great promise to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of many diseases, in particular cancer, and complement invasive and cumbersome tissue biopsies. In January 2015, QIAGEN introduced the therascreen EGFR RGQ Plasma PCR kit, a companion diagnostic paired with a leading treatment of non-small cell lung cancer when a tumor tissue sample cannot be used. The kit has received CE-IVD marking for use in more than 30 European countries and is the first registered companion diagnostic for solid tumors using liquid biopsies. QIAGEN is a global leader in providing tissue and liquid biopsy-based tests for personalized healthcare, the strategy of using companion diagnostics to guide the use of medicines for treatment of cancer and other diseases. The company markets tests in various markets covering a broad range of molecular biomarkers and running on PCR, multi-modal and next-generation sequencing platforms. QIAGEN s growing pipeline includes more than 20 collaborative projects with pharma and biotech companies to commercialize companion diagnostics.","Published: March 17, 2015"

The multi-year collaboration will involve the planned development of a dedicated aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope (TEM) that is capable of imaging radiation-sensitive materials, such as two-dimensional (2D) and organic samples, and selected molecules, with molecular or even atomic-scale resolution. The TEM is also expected to provide spectroscopic information at very low acceleration voltages. ""Current-generation TEMs typically operate at high voltages of up to 300kV, which provides limited contrast and destroys radiation-sensitive samples before they can be imaged,"" states Trisha Rice, vice president and general manager of Materials Science at FEI. ""The SALVE project is focused on designing a TEM that can operate at accelerating voltages as low as 20kV, enabling it to provide new structural and spectroscopic information of samples, which previously could not be imaged because they would be destroyed at the higher voltages."" CEOS, which has expertise in corrected electron optical systems, is focused on developing new optimized corrector technology to compensate for the chromatic and spherical aberration at low voltages. FEI will be developing the TEM system itself, which will be based on a Titan  80-300 TEM platform, one of the world's first and most powerful commercial aberration-corrected microscopes. While the University of Ulm is working on application-related development, including sample preparation methods and the theory of imaging with low-energetic electrons. ""The SALVE project, financially supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts, Baden W rttemberg, Germany, started in 2008 and progress has been made,"" states the project leader, Professor Ute Kaiser, Electron Microscopy Group of Materials Science, University of Ulm. ""We greatly appreciate that FEI has stepped in to build on these developments and bring the SALVE project to its final phase. Our keys to success is the ability to correct optical aberrations, the stability of the microscope platform, and the progress in sample preparation and contrast interpretation. As scientists, we hardly can wait to operate the machine and to see what kinds of ground-breaking discoveries we might possibly be able to achieve."" Prof. Max Haider, CEOS, adds, ""The SALVE project involves the use of low accelerating voltages, which have been rarely used in electron microscopes to date. We have had great success with our spherical aberration correctors on FEI's Titan platform, and we would like to extend that capability to correct the chromatic aberration that dominates at low voltages. This new microscope could open up entirely new fields in materials science, which involve investigating materials that have been impossible to study with existing microscope technology.""","Published: March 17, 2015"

The research team, led by the University of California, Davis, came to this conclusion after developing a new technique for comparing the proteome   all detectable proteins   of human milk with the proteome of the rhesus macaque monkey. The researchers expect the findings will provide a better understanding of human breast-milk composition and identify fundamental nutrients that should be included in infant formula. The study, which revealed the first comprehensive macaque milk proteome and newly identified 524 human milk proteins, is reported online in the Journal of Proteome Research.  Human milk provides a recipe for human nutrition during the neonatal period,  said principal investigator Danielle Lemay, a nutritional biologist at the UC Davis Genome Center.  But because so much remains to be understood about milk s molecular composition, we developed a new technique for analyzing milk proteomics that overcomes earlier barriers,  she said. Using this new method, Lemay and colleagues identified 1,606 proteins in human milk and 518 proteins in rhesus macaque milk. These included 88 milk proteins that were common to both species, but at different levels. Ninety-three percent of those shared proteins were more abundant in human milk than in macaque milk. For example, the researchers found that human milk contained significantly higher levels of milk proteins that help in digestion of fat-like compounds; slow protein digestion; and potentially increase the absorption of iron, vitamin B-12, and vitamin D.   The higher levels of these proteins in human milk are consistent with the well-established perspective that human babies, compared to other primate infants, are born at a slightly earlier stage of development and require higher levels of specific proteins that will nurture them as they mature,  Lemay said. She noted that these proteins found at higher levels in human milk include specific proteins that are enriched in human brain tissues, suggesting that they may be involved in neurodevelopment.  Proteins that appear to have neurodevelopmental significance for human babies will be key targets for future research focused on enhancing infant formula,  Lemay said. Other researchers on the study were first author Kristen L. Beck, Darren Weber, Brett S. Phinney, Jennifer T. Smilowitz, Bo L nnerdal and Ian Korf, all of UC Davis; and Katie Hinde of Harvard University.

According to the World Health Organization, in 2013 nine million people fell ill with TB and 1.5 million died from the disease. Over 95% of TB deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. About one-third of the world's population has latent TB   in other words, they carry the infection but show no symptoms; only around one in ten of infected individuals develop active TB. Evidence suggests that an individual s DNA affects their susceptibility to TB, both in terms of becoming infected and whether the disease progresses from latent to active TB. In order to identify genes that predispose people to TB, an international team of researchers carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS), comparing the genomes of 5,500 TB patients against those of 5,600 healthy controls. In total, the researchers analysed 7.6 million genetic variants. The team found that variants of the gene ASAP1 on chromosome 8 affect individuals  susceptibility to TB. The gene encodes a protein carrying the same name and is highly expressed   in other words, larger amounts of the protein are found   in a particular type of immune cells known as dendritic cells that play a key role in kick-starting the body s immune response to incoming pathogens. The researchers showed that infection with M. tuberculosis leads to the reduction of ASAP1 expression in dendritic cells   but people who have a particular genetic variant in the ASAP1 gene associated with greater susceptibility to TB show stronger reduction of ASAP1 expression after infection than people who have a protective variant of this gene. The researchers found that reducing levels of the ASAP1 protein affects the ability of dendritic cells to move, which explains the mechanism of the previously-known slow migration of dendritic cells infected with M. tuberculosis and may help the pathogen to evade the immune system, leading to TB.  Our study provides a new insight into biological mechanisms of TB,  says Dr Sergey Nejentsev, Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow from the Department of Medicine at the University of Cambridge, who led the research.  TB is a major global health problem and the threat of drug-resistance means that we urgently need to develop new ways of fighting back. In future, it may be possible to target immune pathways that involve ASAP1 to design efficient vaccines for TB prevention.

Genomics is the study of genes, their functions, and how the way they interact influences growth, development, and health throughout life. It is increasingly being recognised as one of the most valuable emerging tools for understanding disease. NHMRC s Targeted Call for Research (TCR) will fund a research project that explores the role genomic medicine will play in improving prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease. The research is expected to result in findings that will help health professionals apply genomics to the management of diseases such as cancer or diabetes. Additionally, the research should improve our understanding of how genomic data will impact patient care, and identify the economic and policy impacts of incorporating genomic data into health system activities. It is expected that the successful team will be multi-disciplinary and nationally focused, drawing on the expertise of Australia s best researchers in this field. NHMRC CEO Professor Warwick Anderson spoke about the potential of genomic medicine and its growing importance in health and medicine.  Genomic medicine is truly the next frontier in how we will approach the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease,  Professor Anderson said.  In health care today, we can already see how genomics is making a difference in the diagnosis of some diseases, including certain types of cancers. The research conducted through this Targeted Call for Research will yield new knowledge that will help us to understand how best to use the power of genomics to improve patient treatment.  he said.  Genomic medicine has the potential to revolutionise health care, but to meet that aspiration, our understanding of the field needs to be built on the sort of rigorous research this TCR will fund.  Preparing Australia for the  omics  revolution in health care was identified as a major health issue for NHMRC in its 2012-15 Strategic Plan.  Separate of this $25 million grant, NHMRC is working with practitioners, policy makers and the community to help Australia deal with the health and ethical implications of these new technologies and ensure that we can make the most of what genomics has to offer health and medicine.  As part of this broader work, NHMRC last year released resources for health professionals and consumers on direct-to-consumer genetic DNA testing, which are available from the NHMRC website. NHMRC is also collaborating internationally through the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health and the Global Genomic Medicine Collaboration. The Targeted Call for Research into Preparing Australia for the Genomics Revolution in Health Care closes on 13 May.

The researchers say the finding, which has been successfully demonstrated in frog embryos, will help scientists control differentiation of various cell types. Their study is being published in print in the March 23 issue of the journal Developmental Cell. Xinjun Zhang and Seong-Moon Cheong, both postdoctoral fellows in the laboratory of HSCI-affiliated faculty member Xi He at Boston Children s Hospital, are co-first authors. The protein, Notum, first discovered in fruit flies in 2002 and then found in mice and humans, is one of many that help determine embryonic development. For some time, researchers have known that Notum regulates wing formation in flies. But until recently, it was not known how Notum affected vertebrate embryo development. In collaboration with researchers from University of Oxford and Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, He and colleagues compared how frog embryos   which are considered models for human embryos   developed with and without Notum. When the researchers injected frog embryos with Notum, the embryos grew bigger brains and heads. When Notum was not present, the embryos would become a sack of skin cells with no head and a tiny brain, a result of embryonic progenitor cells making only epidermal but not neural cells. Simply put, said He,  The frog brain cannot be properly formed without Notum.  These findings could benefit stem cell researchers trying to create specific tissue types or organs in the lab. In order to guide or direct stem cells to differentiate into a given cell type, such as neural cells or muscle cells, researchers continue to alter their experimental recipes, fine-tuning which molecules should be added to their dishes in what sequence and amount. For those trying to create neural cells,  Notum is a necessary ingredient and new tool in the kit box for researchers to instruct human progenitor cells to become neural tissues,  said He, who is also an American Cancer Society research professor. Additionally, the researchers were able to demonstrate how Notum deactivates Wnt, which is a family of proteins that direct stem cells to  self-renew,  or make more stem cells, among other things. If left unchecked, Wnt could cause certain types of cancer, such as gastrointestinal, brain, and blood cancers. The study builds on previous work by HSCI Co-Director Doug Melton, who early in his career did groundbreaking research on the development of the frog nervous system. Its findings complement related research published by Satoshi Kakugawa, Paul F. Langton, and Matthias Zebisch and colleagues in Nature.","Published: March 17, 2015"

Published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, the research showed that a reprogrammed retrovirus could successfully transfer new factor IX (clotting) genes into animals with hemophilia B to dramatically decrease spontaneous bleeding. Thus far, the new therapy has proven safe.  The result was stunning,  said Timothy Nichols, MD, director of the Francis Owen Blood Research Laboratory at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and co-senior author of the paper.  Just a small amount of new factor IX necessary for proper clotting produced a major reduction in bleeding events. It was extraordinarily powerful.  The idea behind gene therapy is that doctors could give hemophilia patients a one-time dose of new clotting genes instead of a lifetime of multiple injections of recombinant factor IX that until very recently had to be given several times a week. A new FDA-approved hemophilia treatment lasts longer than a few days but patients still require injections at least once or twice a month indefinitely. This new gene therapy approach, like other gene therapy approaches, would involve a single injection and could potentially save money while providing a long-term solution to a life-long condition. A major potential advantage of this new gene therapy approach is that it uses lentiviral vectors, to which most people do not have antibodies that would reject the vectors and make the therapy less effective. In human clinical studies, approximately 40 percent of the potential participants screened for a different kind of viral vector   called adeno-associated viral vectors   have antibodies that preclude them from entering AAV trials for hemophilia gene therapy treatment. This means that more people could potentially benefit from the lentivirus gene therapy approach. Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder in which people lack a clotting factor, which means they bleed much more easily than people without the disease. Often, people with hemophilia bleed spontaneously into joints, which can be extremely painful and crippling. Spontaneous bleeds into soft tissues are also common and can be fatal if not treated promptly. Hemophilia A affects about one in 5,000 male births. These patients do not produce enough factor VIII in the liver. This leads to an inability to clot. Hemophilia B affects about one in 35,000 births; these patients lack factor IX. This new method was spearheaded by Luigi Naldini, PhD, director of the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy and co-senior author on the Science Translational Medicine paper. For this study, Naldini and Nichols developed a way to use a lentivirus, which is a large retrovirus, to deliver factor IX genes to the livers of three dogs that have naturally occurring hemophilia. The researchers removed the genes involved in viral replication.  Essentially, this molecular engineering rendered the virus inert,  Nichols said.  It had the ability to get into the body but not cause disease.  This process turned the virus into a vector   simply a vehicle to carry genetic cargo. Unlike some other viral vectors that have been used for gene therapy experiments, the lentiviral vector is so large that it can carry a lot of payload   namely, the factor IX genes that people with hemophilia B lack. (This approach could also be used for hemophilia A where the FVIII gene is considerably larger.) These viral vectors were then injected directly into the liver or intravenously. After more than three years, the three dogs in the study experienced zero or one serious bleeding event each year. Before the therapy, the dogs experienced an average of five spontaneous bleeding events that required clinical treatment. Importantly, the researchers detected no harmful effects.  This safety feature is of paramount importance,  Nichols said.  Prior work elsewhere during the early 2000s used retroviruses for gene therapy to treat people with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, but some patients in clinical trials developed leukemia.  Newer retroviral vectors, though, have so far proved safe for SCID patients. To further demonstrate the safety of this new hemophilia treatment, Nichols and Naldini used three different strains of mice that were highly susceptible to developing complications, such as malignancies, when introduced to lentiviruses. But the researchers found no harmful effects in the mice. The researchers think that turning the lentivirus into a lentiviral vector made it safe.  Considering the mouse model data and the absence of detectible genotoxicity during long-term expression in the hemophilia B dogs, the lentiviral vectors have a very encouraging safety profile in this case,  Nichols said. More work still needs to be done before this gene therapy approach can be used in human clinical trials. For instance, researchers hope to increase the potency of the therapy to decrease spontaneous bleeding even more while also keeping the therapy safe. Before the treatment, the hemophilia dogs had no sign of factor IX production. After the treatment, they exhibited between 1 and 3 percent of the production found in normal dogs. This slight increase was enough to substantially decrease bleeding events. Still, Nichols said it would be best if they could boost factor IX production to between 5 and 10 percent of normal while still remaining safe. This amount of factor IX expression could potentially eliminate spontaneous bleeding events for people with hemophilia B.","Published: March 17, 2015"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/autoimmune-disease-superregulators-uncovered-187500,Autoimmune Disease Super Regulators Uncovered Scientists discovered key genetic switches  called super enhancers  involved in regulating the human immune system  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The immune system has a complex, delicately orchestrated balance. White blood cells called CD4 T cells can mature to become many types of T cells, each of which has a distinct function. Some activate immune responses; others constrain immune responses. When the system is out of balance, uncontrolled reactions can lead to attacks against the body s own cells and tissues and cause autoimmune disease. Many different tissues can be affected. For example, joints become swollen and inflamed in rheumatoid arthritis, and the brain and spinal cord are damaged in multiple sclerosis. Autoimmune diseases often run in families. However, identifying susceptibility genes has been a challenge. In most cases, a mix of genetic and environmental factors is at play. The genetic variants tied to these diseases tend to lie in regions involved in regulating genes, rather than in genes themselves. A research team led by Drs. Golnaz Vahedi and John J. O Shea at NIH s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) investigated the role of a recently discovered type of genetic regulatory element called super-enhancers, or stretch-enhancers (SE). Earlier work in other laboratories including that of NIH Director Dr. Francis S. Collins showed that SEs are especially powerful switches that control genes important for cell identity. A large number of disease-associated genetic alterations have been found to fall within SEs. The team searched the genome of T cells for regions bound by a protein called histone acetyltransferase p300, which marks DNA segments that carry SEs. As reported online in Nature on February 16, 2015, the scientists found several hundred genes associated with SEs. The dominant gene class associated with SEs in T cells encoded cytokines and cytokine receptors. These allow T cells to communicate with other cells and coordinate the immune response. A large fraction of variants previously associated with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases also localized to T cell SEs. However, the greatest SE enrichment in T cells was associated with the gene for BACH2, which has been previously associated with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Recently, NIH scientists found that a major function of BACH2 is controlling the activation of T cells. When the scientists exposed human T cells to tofacitinib a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis the activities of many genes controlled by SEs were preferentially affected. However, BACH2 levels were unchanged. This result suggests that tofacitinib may act on SEs independent of BACH2 to alter the activities of important T cell genes.  Three types of data the genetics of rheumatoid arthritis, a genomic feature of T cells, and the pharmacological effects of a rheumatoid arthritis drug are all pointing to the importance of super-enhancers,  Vahedi says.  These regions are where we plan to search for insights into the mechanisms that underlie rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, and for novel therapeutic targets for these conditions.

Using micro-CT scans, the team showed that the trees respond to being tilted by producing a sugar-rich, gelatinous fibre, which helps them stay upright. Willows are suitable for widespread cultivation as biofuels because they produce large quantities of accessible sugar, are fast-growing and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions, such as windy slopes and poor soil. In fact, trees grown in harsher conditions or polluted soil can even produce better biofuel because the sugar they produce is more accessible, requiring less energy to harvest it. Growing the willow trees at a 45-degree angle simulates this natural stress, encouraging the trees to produce up to five times more sugar than plants grown normally. But exactly why and how this happens has not been clear until now. Researchers at Imperial College London worked with experts at the Natural History Museum, the University of Surrey and Rothamsted Research Centre to use X-ray micro-computed tomography (CT scanning) to examine the willow's growth through high resolution 3D images. This enabled them to see the changes in the willow at a cellular level and how they affected the plant's growth. They found that tilted willows prolonged the life of certain cells in order to produce a sugar-rich, or gelatinous, fibre, to help them stay upright. The team were able to measure how much longer the cells needed to stay alive to produce the special fibre. ""It was difficult to see why the trees were releasing so much more sugar when stressed in nature or grown at an angle. Being able to visualize the differences occurring at a microscale, or cellular level, allowed an insight into the biology behind the macroscale effects on the whole tree,"" explains Dr Nicholas Brereton, from Imperial's Department of Life Sciences. ""Willow is a great crop because it grows in really inhospitable places. It can add value to marginal land and is also useful for helping to clean up areas of polluted land,"" adds Dr Brereton. ""Our research will help the biofuel sector select and use growing sites and conditions where no other crops can survive."" The research was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, and is published in BMC Plant Biology. The next step for the team will be to use even higher resolution CT scanning to investigate the gelatinous fibres in more detail. The aim will be to measure how much of the fibre is produced by different plants, which will help identify which species of willow are likely to be the world's best 2nd generation biofuel producers. As well as being a valuable research tool, the use of CT scanning techniques to look into plants and animals is also an extremely useful teaching resource, believes Dr Brereton. He is already working with the colleagues at Imperial College to integrate 3D micro-images into undergraduate teaching. ""Students would recognize this sort of imaging from medicine, but the greatly increased resolution of X-ray micro-CT at the NHM means we can explore the biological world in a thousand times more detail, and in 3D,"" says Dr Brereton.","Published: March 17, 2015"

To help address this issue Congenica - a spinout from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute - has been awarded  2m Phase 2 funding by the Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) announced by Genomics England. Funding will be used to increase the rate and quality of gene mutation identification and improve the accuracy of gene-disease associations in order to create robust e-diagnostics for whole genome sequences. Dr Tom Weaver, CEO of Congenica, a leading developer of DNA sequence analytics and diagnostic technologies, comments:  We welcome the SBRI Phase 2 award as it will not only fund further development and implementation of Sapientia, our diagnostics tool, but also provides a valuable endorsement of our technology. This will accelerate the process of embedding genomic medicine into mainstream clinical practice thereby providing benefits to patients and healthcare services.  The Sapientia  technology is able to screen whole genome sequence data in order to identify gene mutations and highlight those that are associated with inherited and acquired genetic disorders. This information is interpreted to allow hospital consultants to make an improved diagnosis. For families with young children affected by rare genetic disease, a diagnosis is critical for guiding management and therapy as well as enabling counselling and better informed reproductive choice. Sapientia is built upon world leading technology developed by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, including the work of Dr Matthew Hurles, co-founder of Congenica and scientific leader of the  Deciphering Developmental Disorders  (DDD) study, the world's largest, nationwide genome-wide rare disease sequencing programme. Further validation of the technology underlying Sapientia comes from findings of the DDD research project, reported in Nature and the Lancet in December 2014. These studies showed that approximately one third of previously undiagnosed children could now be diagnosed. Dr Matthew Hurles comments:  The study has shown that identifying and prioritizing those variants that have a potential gene-disease association will significantly increase both speed and accuracy of diagnosis. The SBRI funding will enable us to fast-track the latest research into patient care.  SBRI funding is designed to support the development of new commercial products to explore the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of genomics screening. The value to the UK economy was highlighted by Dr Robert Tansley of Cambridge Innovation Capital (CIC), an investment company established to help retain UK innovation in the Cambridge cluster and a lead investor into Congenica. He says:  Government funding through SBRI helps to de-risk technology for subsequent investment. Congenica s technology has been independently validated by Genomics England and has the support of NHS clinicians. The NHS is internationally recognized for its rigorous approach and this provides confidence in the diagnostic tool for international markets.  There is a huge worldwide market for Congenica s technology, there are currently 200,000 genetic tests performed each year in the UK just for rare diseases,  he continues.  We see Sapientia as a powerful enabler that can realise the potential for a radically different type of genome analysis service. SBRI is supporting the development of a new ecosystem of related businesses.  Genomics England has (11 March 2015) announced the successful companies in its Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) Phase Two assessment of Enabling Technologies for Genomics Sequence Data Analysis and Interpretation. Professor Tim Hubbard, Head of Genome Analysis at Genomics England commented,  For widespread use of genome sequencing in routine health care the development of accurate and reliable interpretation software is critical. We are encouraged to see new and existing companies developing products and services in this space; building on UK academic research, in part stimulated though the existence of the Genomics England, the 100,000 Genomes Project, and this competition. We believe that there is now a critical mass of medical bioinformatics translational activity in the UK that puts the UK in a good position to be a leader in the global market for genomic analysis services .","Published: March 17, 2015"

Many populations of Palmer amaranth have evolved resistance to glyphosate and other herbicides over the last decade, and additional control methods for this weed are now being evaluated. A new study published in the journal Weed Science investigated the effect of delaying Palmer amaranth establishment on weed growth and seed production. In field trials conducted over two consecutive growing seasons in Georgia, Palmer amaranth was planted in cotton fields between 0 and 12 weeks after the crop, and compared with Palmer amaranth planted simultaneously without cotton. Without crop competition, the earliest planting of Palmer amaranth produced 446,000 seeds per plant, with seed production falling 50% when plants were established 6 weeks later. When cotton plants were present and competing with the weeds for resources, the number of seeds per plant was reduced 30% to 312,000 for Palmer amaranth plants established at the same time as the cotton. The more time into the growing season the establishment of Palmer amaranth was delayed, the fewer seeds developed. Planting at 6 weeks after cotton establishment reduced the Palmer amaranth seed count by half, and for weeds established 9 and 12 weeks into the growing season, seed production was reduced by 89 and 99%, respectively, compared to weeds established at the same time as cotton. Cotton yield was reduced 67% when Palmer amaranth was established at the same time as the crop, while delaying weed establishment until 6 weeks after crop planting reduced yield loss to below 30%. These results show that early season weed control programs that successfully delay Palmer amaranth establishment can have a large effect on crop yield, weed growth and weed seed production. In addition, reducing the soil seedbank is a vital preemptive measure against the next season s weeds.","Published: March 17, 2015"

The idea, which came to her during her placement year designing products for people with sight loss, uses the properties of gelatine to exactly match the rate to which fresh foods go off. The Bump Mark is designed to be much more accurate than  use by  dates. It starts off feeling smooth to the touch but once the food inside becomes unsafe to eat the gelatine turns liquid and the label feels bumpy. As well as being perfect for people with sight loss, Solveiga hopes the patented idea will help reduce the tonnes of perfectly good food discarded each year in the UK, which is past its use by date but still safe to eat. The Low Carbon Entrepreneur competition asks London's students and recent graduates to come up with ideas to reduce the capital's energy use and carbon emissions. Two other Brunel University London student projects made the 10-strong shortlist, including international student accommodation finder Stars Key and Hutch from MBA students Rajan Dua and Paul Ouro. The business uses a societal web-platform, digital word of mouth and offline campaigning to promote eco-homes and energy efficient housing, ranking most highly the rental properties that have the best environment-friendly features.

The findings were recently published online in the journal Radiology. In this study, Mayo Clinic identified patients who donated their body to medical research and had undergone multiple gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI exams during their lifetime. Brain tissue samples from these patients were then compared to donors who had never received a gadolinium contrast agent. The patients exposed to the gadolinium contrast had measurable quantities of gadolinium deposited in their brain tissue, whereas those never exposed to gadolinium had none. Researchers were able to directly measure gadolinium concentrations and visualize patterns of deposition in brain tissues. ""Given that these agents are administered millions of times every year, this is an important discovery,"" says study author, Laurence Eckel, M.D., radiologist, Mayo Clinic. ""Despite evidence that trace amounts of gadolinium are depositing in neural tissues, there is currently no data to suggest that it's harmful to patients,"" says Dr. Eckel. ""These FDA-approved, gadolinium-based contrast agents provide critical information to radiologists and other physicians, enabling more accurate and timely diagnosis of disease. Such information is essential in guiding both medical and surgical decisions for best patient care,"" he continues. The Mayo Clinic Department of Radiology continues to recommend the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents whenever they are clinically appropriate based upon all available data. ""The findings challenge our understanding of how these agents distribute in the body following intravenous gadolinium contrast administration. These agents have been safely used for years, benefiting patients around the world,"" says Dr. Eckel.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/surprising-finding-made-stroke-research-283060,Surprising finding made in stroke research Scientists at The University of Manchester have made an important new discovery about the brain s immune system that could lead to potential new treatments for stroke and other related conditions  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Inflammation is activated in the brain after a stroke, but rather than aiding recovery it actually causes and worsens damage. That damage can be devastating. In fact, stroke is responsible for 10% of deaths worldwide and is the leading cause of disability.  Therefore, understanding how inflammation is regulated in the brain is vital for the development of drugs to limit the damage triggered by a stroke. Dr David Brough from the Faculty of Life Sciences, working alongside colleagues including Professors Dame Nancy Rothwell and Stuart Allan, has studied the role of inflammasomes in stroke. These inflammasomes are large protein complexes essential for the production of the inflammatory protein interleukin-1. Interleukin-1 has many roles in the body, and contributes to cell death in the brain following a stroke. Dr Brough explains:  Very little is known about how inflammasomes might be involved in brain injury. Therefore we began by studying the most well researched inflammasome NLRP3, which is known to be activated when the body is injured. Surprisingly we found that this was not involved in inflammation and damage in the brain caused by stroke, even though drugs are being developed to block this to treat Alzheimer s disease.  Further studies using experimental models of stroke demonstrated that it was actually the NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes that contribute to brain injury, rather than NLRP3.  This discovery was unexpected, since NLRC4, was only known to fight infections and yet Dr Brough and colleagues found that it caused injury in the brain. This new discovery will help the Manchester researchers discover more about how inflammation is involved in brain injury and develop new drugs for the treatment of stroke.  The research was funded by the Wellcome Trust and Medical Research Council and has been published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). As well as identifying new targets for potential drug treatments for stroke Dr Brough points out how little we currently know about how the immune system works in the brain. He says:  We know very little about how the immune system is regulated in the brain. However, its important we understand this since it contributes to disease and injury. For example, in addition to stroke, Alzheimer s disease has an inflammatory aspect and even depression may be driven by inflammation.

The preliminary findings of the DEFLECT III trial were presented by Alexandra Lansky, M.D., associate professor of medicine (cardiology) at Yale School of Medicine, on March 15 at the American College of Cardiology's 64th Annual Scientific Session in San Diego, CA. Stroke is a devastating complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), a minimally invasive procedure to repair a damaged heart valve without surgery. Up to 7% of TAVR patients suffer strokes due to the release of emboli, or particulate material such as a plaque, that travel in the blood from the heart to the brain during the valve procedure. Led by co-principal investigators Lansky and Andreas Baumbach, M.D. of Bristol Heart Institute, the research team conducted a preliminary trial of the TriGuard, a device that is placed in the aortic arch during TAVR. The device has a mesh filter that covers the three major cerebral blood vessels, preventing the release of emboli from the aorta to the brain. Conducted in centers in Europe and Israel, the exploratory trial enrolled 83 subjects and randomized them for TAVR with and without TriGuard protection. In patients with protection, the researchers observed fewer ischemic brain lesions and lesions of reduced volume. ""One of the major findings is, for the first time, we're showing that with protection, 55% more patients have completely clean brains -- with no ischemic brain lesions at all,"" said Lansky. Brain lesions increase risk of dementia and stroke two- to three-fold. ""What's more exciting are the neurocognitive findings,"" noted Lansky. The researchers used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to evaluate the impact of TriGuard on cognitive factors such as language, memory, attention, recall, and orientation. ""Whether we're looking at MoCA or looking at short-term memory or delayed memory, we're seeing an improvement in cognitive function as early as hospital discharge among protected patients, compared to controls,"" she explained. These preliminary findings provide the basis to design a conclusive randomized clinical trial. ""DEFLECT III is helping us design the next study, which will be definitive,"" Lansky noted.

It is well known in single-celled organisms and thought to be an important process that explains how quickly bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics, for example. Horizontal gene transfer is also thought to play an important role in the evolution of some animals, including nematode worms, which have acquired genes from microorganisms and plants, and some beetles that gained bacterial genes to produce enzymes for digesting coffee berries. However, the idea that horizontal gene transfer occurs in more complex animals, such as humans has been widely debated and contested. Lead author Alastair Crisp from the Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology at the University of Cambridge said:  This is the first study to show how widely horizontal gene transfer occurs in animals, including humans, giving rise to tens or hundreds of active 'foreign' genes.  Surprisingly, far from being a rare occurrence, it appears that this has contributed to the evolution of many, perhaps all, animals and that the process is ongoing. We may need to re-evaluate how we think about evolution.  The researchers studied the genomes of 12 species of fruit fly, four species of nematode worm, and ten species of primate, including humans. They calculated how well each of their genes aligns to similar genes in other species to estimate how likely they were to be foreign in origin. By comparing with other groups of species, they were able to estimate how long ago the genes were likely to have been acquired. In humans, they confirmed 17 previously-reported genes acquired from horizontal gene transfer, and identified 128 additional foreign genes in the human genome that have not previously been reported. A number of genes, including the ABO gene, which determines an individual s blood group, were also confirmed as having been acquired by vertebrates through horizontal gene transfer. The majority of the genes were related to enzymes involved in metabolism. In humans, some of the genes were involved in lipid metabolism, including the breakdown of fatty acids and the formation of glycolipids. Others were involved in immune responses, including the inflammatory response, immune cell signalling, and antimicrobial responses, while further gene categories include amino-acid metabolism, protein modification and antioxidant activities. The team identified the likely class of organisms from which the transferred genes came. Bacteria and protists, another class of microorganisms, were the most common donors in all species studied. They also identified horizontal gene transfer from viruses, which was responsible for up to 50 more foreign genes in primates. Some genes were identified as having originated from fungi. This explains why some previous studies, which only focused on bacteria as the source of horizontal gene transfer, originally rejected the idea that these genes were  foreign  in origin. The majority of horizontal gene transfer in primates was found to be ancient, occurring sometime between the common ancestor of Chordata and the common ancestor of the primates. The authors say that their analysis probably underestimates the true extent of horizontal gene transfer in animals and that direct transfer between complex multicellular organisms is also plausible, and already known in some host-parasite relationships. The study also has potential impacts on genome sequencing more generally. Genome projects frequently remove bacterial sequences from results on the assumption that they are contamination.  It s important to screen for contamination when we re doing genome sequencing, but our study shows that we shouldn t ignore the potential for bacterial sequences being a genuine part of an animal s genome originating from horizontal gene transfer,  adds Dr Chiara Boschetti from the Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology. The research was supported by the European Research Council.","Published: March 16, 2015"

The research, conducted by Polina Anikeeva, an assistant professor of materials science and engineering, graduate student Ritchie Chen, and three others, has been published in the journal Science. Previous efforts to stimulate the brain using pulses of electricity have proven effective in reducing or eliminating tremors associated with Parkinson s disease, but the treatment has remained a last resort because it requires highly invasive implanted wires that connect to a power source outside the brain.  In the future, our technique may provide an implant-free means to provide brain stimulation and mapping,  Anikeeva says. In their study, the team injected magnetic iron oxide particles just 22 nanometers in diameter into the brain. When exposed to an external alternating magnetic field   which can penetrate deep inside biological tissues   these particles rapidly heat up. The resulting local temperature increase can then lead to neural activation by triggering heat-sensitive capsaicin receptors   the same proteins that the body uses to detect both actual heat and the  heat  of spicy foods. (Capsaicin is the chemical that gives hot peppers their searing taste.) Anikeeva s team used viral gene delivery to induce the sensitivity to heat in selected neurons in the brain. The particles, which have virtually no interaction with biological tissues except when heated, tend to remain where they re placed, allowing for long-term treatment without the need for further invasive procedures.  The nanoparticles integrate into the tissue and remain largely intact,  Anikeeva says.  Then, that region can be stimulated at will by externally applying an alternating magnetic field. The goal for us was to figure out whether we could deliver stimuli to the nervous system in a wireless and noninvasive way.  The new work has proven that the approach is feasible, but much work remains to turn this proof-of-concept into a practical method for brain research or clinical treatment. The use of magnetic fields and injected particles has been an active area of cancer research; the thought is that this approach could destroy cancer cells by heating them.  The new technique is derived, in part, from that research,  Anikeeva says.  By calibrating the delivered thermal dosage, we can excite neurons without killing them. The magnetic nanoparticles also have been used for decades as contrast agents in MRI scans, so they are considered relatively safe in the human body.  The team developed ways to make the particles with precisely controlled sizes and shapes, in order to maximize their interaction with the applied alternating magnetic field. They also developed devices to deliver the applied magnetic field: Existing devices for cancer treatment   intended to produce much more intense heating   were far too big and energy-inefficient for this application. The next step toward making this a practical technology for clinical use in humans  is to understand better how our method works through neural recordings and behavioral experiments, and assess whether there are any other side effects to tissues in the affected area,  Anikeeva says. This is  a completely novel approach for deep-brain stimulation,  says Bianxiao Cui, an assistant professor of chemistry at Stanford University who was not involved in this research.  The new method is significant in that it is relatively more easily administered and induces less brain-tissue responses as compared with electrode implantation. More importantly, the stimulation could be remotely controlled, a highly appealing feature for deep-brain stimulation.  In addition to Anikeeva and Chen, the research team also included postdoc Gabriela Romero, graduate student Michael Christiansen, and undergraduate Alan Mohr. The work was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, MIT s McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and the National Science Foundation.","Published: March 16, 2015"

Malignant tumors contain stem cells, prompting worries among medical experts that the cells  transformative powers help cancers escape treatment. New research proves that the threat posed by cancer stem cells is more prevalent than previously thought. Until now, stem cells had been identified only in aggressive, fast-growing tumors. But a mouse study at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that slow-growing tumors also have treatment-resistant stem cells.  The low-grade brain cancer stem cells identified by the scientists also were less sensitive to anticancer drugs. By comparing healthy stem cells with stem cells from these brain tumors, the researchers discovered the reasons behind treatment resistance, pointing to new therapeutic strategies.  At the very least, we re going to have to use different drugs and different, likely higher dosages to make sure we kill these tumor stem cells,  said senior author David H. Gutmann, MD, PhD, the Donald O. Schnuck Family Professor of Neurology. The research appears online March 12 in Cell Reports. First author Yi-Hsien Chen, PhD, a senior postdoctoral research associate in Gutmann s laboratory, used a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) low-grade brain tumors to identify cancer stem cells and demonstrate that they could form tumors when transplanted into normal, cancer-free mice.  NF1 is a genetic disorder that affects about 1 in every 2,500 babies. The condition can cause an array of problems, including brain tumors, impaired vision, learning disabilities, behavioral problems, heart defects and bone deformities. The most common brain tumor in children with NF1 is the optic glioma. Treatment for NF1-related optic gliomas often includes drugs that inhibit a cell growth pathway originally identified by Gutmann. In laboratory tests conducted as part of the new research, it took 10 times the dosage of these drugs to kill the low-grade cancer stem cells. Compared with healthy stem cells from the brain, the cancer stem cells made more copies of a protein called Abcg1 that helps those cells survive stress.  This protein blocks a signal from inside the cells that should make them more vulnerable to treatment,  Gutmann explained.  If we can identify a drug that disables this protein, it would make some cancer stem cells easier to kill.  Although the mice the researchers studied were bred to model NF1 optic gliomas, the researchers said the findings could be applied more broadly to other brain tumors.  Because stem cells haven t differentiated into specialized cells, they can easily activate genes to turn on new developmental programs that allow the cells to survive cancer treatments,  said Gutmann, who directs the Washington University Neurofibromatosis Center.  Based on these new findings, we will have to develop additional strategies to keep these tumors from evading our best treatments. ","Published: March 16, 2015"

According to a latest study, listening to classical music enhanced the activity of genes involved in dopamine secretion and transport, synaptic neurotransmission, learning and memory, and down-regulated the genes mediating neurodegeneration. Several of the up-regulated genes were known to be responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds, suggesting a common evolutionary background of sound perception across species. Listening to music represents a complex cognitive function of the human brain, which is known to induce several neuronal and physiological changes. However, the molecular background underlying the effects of listening to music is largely unknown. A Finnish study group has investigated how listening to classical music affected the gene expression profiles of both musically experienced and inexperienced participants. All the participants listened to W.A. Mozart s violin concert Nr 3, G-major, K.216 that lasts 20 minutes. Listening to music enhanced the activity of genes involved in dopamine secretion and transport, synaptic function, learning and memory. One of the most up-regulated genes, synuclein-alpha (SNCA) is a known risk gene for Parkinson s disease that is located in the strongest linkage region of musical aptitude. SNCA is also known to contribute to song learning in songbirds.  The up-regulation of several genes that are known to be responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds suggest a shared evolutionary background of sound perception between vocalizing birds and humans , says Dr. Irma J rvel , the leader of the study. In contrast, listening to music down-regulated genes that are associated with neurodegeneration, referring to a neuroprotective role of music.  The effect was only detectable in musically experienced participants, suggesting the importance of familiarity and experience in mediating music-induced effects , researchers remark. The findings give new information about the molecular genetic background of music perception and evolution, and may give further insights about the molecular mechanisms underlying music therapy.

What the science says about Friday the 13th For some people, Friday the 13th instills fear and dread, while for others it s just another Friday. But does science support the superstitions behind this apprehension? Should you get out of bed today or tuck yourself back under the covers to stay safe and sound? Over the years, scientists have analyzed the data, dissecting the underlying accident rates of this proposed unlucky day.   Remediation of addiction with a 1-2 punch of DBS & dopamine receptor antagonists Pathological changes to synaptic transmission underlie part of the etiology of different neurological and psychiatric diseases including Parkinson s disease and drug addiction. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for tremors associated with Parkinson s disease. In a recent article published in Science, Creed, Pascoli and L scher demonstrate that a combination of DBS and pharmaceuticals leads to long-term improvement in synaptic transmission and addiction-related behavior.   Blood-based genetic biomarkers identify young boys with autism In a study published in JAMA Psychiatry, an international team of scientists report finding a highly accurate blood-based measure that could lead to development of a clinical test for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in males as young as one to two years old. The test could be done in community pediatric settings. The degree of accuracy, they said, out performs other behavioral and genetic screens for infants and toddlers with ASD described in literature.   Promising Alzheimer s treatment moves toward clinical trials A promising new natural treatment for Alzheimer's disease is moving toward clinical trials. This will be a major step forward as there is nothing on the market that slows the progression of Alzheimer's.

New research from The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) shows that two proteins critical for maintaining healthy day-night cycles also protect against mutations that could lead to cancer. The new study, published March 10, 2015, in the journal eLife, shows that the two proteins have an unexpected role in DNA repair, possibly protecting cells from cancer-causing mutations triggered by UV radiation.  These proteins play an important role in the response to DNA damage,  said TSRI biologist Katja Lamia, senior author of the study.  Researchers might eventually harness that knowledge for pharmaceutical targeting.  Day and Night The human body senses light and adjusts its rhythms to a day-night cycle called the circadian clock. Feeling tired? Feeling hungry? These feelings are strongly influenced by the body s circadian clock.  Studies show that people with unusual sleep schedules, such as flight attendants or night-shift nurses, are at risk for certain health problems.  When you have a deregulation of your circadian clock, you re more prone to develop some kind of pathology, like diabetes, cancer or heart disease,  said TSRI Research Associate Anne-Laure Huber, who was co-first author of the study with Stephanie Papp, a graduate student at TSRI. In the new study, the research team investigated a possible cause of these health disparities. They focused on the role of proteins called cryptochromes, which are believed to have evolved from light-activated DNA repair enzymes in bacteria. Cryptochromes contain a photo-responsive pigment called flavin. While cryptochromes are no longer light-activated, they do hold to a daytime-regulated schedule, and stability of the proteins cryptochrome 1 (Cry1) and cryptochrome 2 (Cry2) is critical for circadian clock function. In the human body, cryptochromes no longer have a direct role in DNA repair either, but they are essential for regulating blood sugar levels and protein production on a day-night cycle. Repairing DNA The new study started when the researchers went on what Lamia calls a  fishing expedition.  They used a technique called proteomic screening, in collaboration with the laboratory of TSRI Professor John Yates, to test for a wide range of proteins that could bind to Cry1 or Cry2 from mouse and human cells.  The team found that Cry1 could bind with Hausp, a protein with a known role in regulating an anti-cancer protein called p53. The screening also showed that Hausp binds to Cry2, but not as strongly, suggesting that the nearly identical proteins actually have different roles related to DNA repair.  Most of the time people study them as redundant proteins, but we show that they have distinct functions in this DNA-repair pathway,  said Lamia. Subsequent studies of genetic expression showed that Hausp stabilizes Cry1 by removing protein chains that trigger Cry1 degradation. By stabilizing Cry1, Hausp prevents potential errors in DNA transcription that could occur when DNA is exposed to radiation.  This is very cool,  said Papp.  These proteins can sense that something is wrong in the cells.  The researchers also found that when they blocked Cry2 production in cells, the cells no longer activated p21, a protein that stops mutant cells from dividing.  This could suggest that cells without Cry2 would be more susceptible to cancer,  said Lamia. Together, these findings show that while Cry1 and Cry2 no longer directly repair DNA, they still have an indirect role in the repair process.  This new link between circadian clock proteins and DNA repair is a clue to how disrupting day-night cycles could harm health. Lamia said future studies in her lab will explore additional roles of cryptochromes in the body. In addition to Papp, Huber, Yates and Lamia, authors of the study  DNA damage shifts circadian clock time via Hausp-dependent Cry1 stabilization,  were Sabine D.

AFM images surface topography of a structure by  touching  and  feeling  its surface by scanning an extremely fine needle (the diameter of the tip is about 5 nanometers, about 1/100 of light wavelength or 1/10,000 of a hair) on the surface. This technique has been applied to image solid materials with nanometer resolution, but it has been difficult to apply AFM for a soft and large sample like eukaryotic cells and neurons without damaging the sample. Additionally, image acquisition with conventional AFM is too slow to capture fast cellular morphology changes. Researchers have extensively modified the AFM system for imaging eukaryotic cells and neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution. This new system allows for analysis of cell morphology changes with a spatial resolution ~20-100 fold better than that of a standard light microscope. While progress has been made over the past decades in the pursuit to optimize atomic force microscopy (AFM) for imaging living cells, there were still a number of limitations and technological issues that needed to be addressed before fundamental questions in cell biology could be address in living cells. In their March publication in Scientific Reports, Drs. Ryohei Yasuda and Mikihiro Shibata at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience in collaboration with Kanazawa University describe how they have built the new AFM system optimized for live-cell imaging. The system differs in many ways from a conventional AFM: it uses an extremely long and sharp needle attached to a highly flexible plate. The system is also optimized for fast scanning to capture dynamic cellular events. These modifications have enabled researchers to image living cells, such as mammalian cell lines or mature hippocampal neurons, without any sign of cellular damage.  We ve now demonstrated that our new AFM can directly visualize nanometer-scale morphological changes in living cells , explained Dr. Yasuda, neuroscientist and scientific director at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. In particular, this study demonstrates the capability to track structural dynamics and remodeling of the cell surface, such as morphogenesis of filopodia, membrane ruffles, pit formation or endocytosis, in response to environmental stimulants. According to Dr. Yasuda, the successful observations of structural dynamics in live neurons present the possibility of visualizing the morphology of synapses at nanometer resolution in real time in the near future. Since morphology changes of synapses underlie synaptic plasticity and our learning and memory, this will provide us with many new insights into mechanisms of how neurons store information in their morphology, how it changes synaptic strength and ultimately how it creates new memory.

Mass spectrometry provides a very precise accounting of the proteins, lipids and other molecules in a given tissue, but in a spatially coarse or pixelated manner. Combining the best features of both imaging modalities allows scientists to see the molecular make-up of tissues in high resolution.  That to me is just phenomenal,  said Caprioli, the Stanford Moore Professor of Biochemistry and director of the Mass Spectrometry Research Center. Caprioli said the technique could redefine the surgical  margin,  the line between cancer cells and normal cells where the scalpel goes to remove the tumor. Currently that line is determined by histology   the appearance of cells examined under the microscope. But many cancers recur after surgery. That could be because what appear to be normal cells, when analyzed for their protein content using mass spectrometry, are actually cancer cells in the making.  The application of image fusion approaches to the analysis of tissue sections by microscopy and mass spectrometry is a significant innovation that should change the way that these techniques are used together,  said Douglas Sheeley, Sc.D., senior scientific officer in the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS).  It is an important step in the process of making mass spectrometry data accessible and truly useful for clinicians,  he said. The NIGMS, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), partially funded the research (grant numbers GM058008 and GM103391). The image fusion project was led by Raf Van de Plas, Ph.D., a research assistant professor of Biochemistry who also has a faculty position at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Other co-authors were postdoctoral fellow Junhai Yang, Ph.D., and Jeffrey Spraggins, Ph.D., research assistant professor of Biochemistry. Using a mathematical approach called regression analysis, the researchers mapped each pixel of mass spectrometry data onto the corresponding spot on the microscopy image to produce a new,  predicted  image. It s similar in concept to the line drawn between experimentally determined points in a standard curve, Caprioli said. There are no  real  points between those that were actually measured, yet the line is predicted by the previous experiments.

""These droplets sense one another, they move and interact, almost like living cells,"" said Manu Prakash, an assistant professor of bioengineering and senior author of an article published in Nature. The unexpected findings may prove useful in semiconductor manufacturing and self-cleaning solar panels, but what truly excites Prakash is that the discovery resulted from years of persistent effort to satisfy a scientific curiosity. The research began in 2009 when Nate Cira, then an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin, was doing an unrelated experiment. In the course of that experiment Cira deposited several droplets of food coloring onto a sterilized glass slide and was astonished when they began to move. Cira replicated and studied this phenomenon alone for two years until he became a graduate student at Stanford, where he shared this curious observation with Prakash. The professor soon became hooked by the puzzle, and recruited a third member to the team: Adrien Benusiglio, a postdoctoral scholar in the Prakash Lab. Together they spent three years performing increasingly refined experiments to learn how these tiny droplets of food coloring sense one another and move. In living cells these processes of sensing and motility are known as chemotaxis. ""We've discovered how droplets can exhibit behaviors akin to artificial chemotaxis,"" Prakash said. As the Nature article explains, the critical fact was that food coloring is a two-component fluid. In such fluids, two different chemical compounds coexist while retaining separate molecular identities The droplets in this experiment consisted of two molecular compounds found naturally in food coloring: water and propylene glycol. The researchers discovered how the dynamic interactions of these two molecular components enabled inanimate droplets to mimic some of the behaviors of living cells. Surface tension and evaporation  Essentially, the droplets danced because of a delicate balance between surface tension and evaporation. Evaporation is easily understood. On the surface of any liquid, some molecules convert to a gaseous state and float away. Surface tension is what causes liquids to bead up. It arises from how tightly the molecules in a liquid bind together. Water evaporates more quickly than propylene glycol. Water also has a higher surface tension.  These differences create a tornado-like flow inside the droplets, which not only allows them to move but also allows a single droplet to sense its neighbors. To understand the molecular forces involved, imagine shrinking down to size and diving inside a droplet. There, water and propylene glycol molecules try to remain evenly distributed but differences in evaporation and surface tension create turmoil within the droplet. On the curved dome of each droplet, water molecules become gaseous and float away faster than their evaporation-averse propylene glycol neighbors. This evaporation happens more readily on the thin lower edges of the domed droplet, leaving excess of propylene glycol there. Meanwhile, the peak of the dome has a higher concentration of water. The water at the top exerts its higher surface tension to pull the droplet tight so it doesn't flatten out. This tugging causes a tumbling molecular motion inside the droplet. Thus surface tension gets the droplet ready to roll. Evaporation determines the direction of that motion. Each droplet sends aloft gaseous molecules of water like a radially emanating signal announcing the exact location of any given droplet. The droplets converge where the signal is strongest. So evaporation provided the sensing mechanism and surface tension the pull to move droplets together in what seemed to the eye to be a careful dance. Rule for two-component fluids The researchers experimented with varied proportions of water and propylene glycol. Droplets that were 1 percent propylene glycol (PG) to 99 percent water exhibited much the same behavior as droplets that were two-thirds PG to just one-third water. Based on these experiments the paper describes a ""universal rule"" to identify any two-component fluids that will demonstrate sensing and motility. Adding colors to the mixtures made it easier to tell how the droplets of different concentrations behaved and created some visually striking results. In one experiment, a droplet with more propylene glycol seems to chase a droplet with more water. In actuality, the droplet with more water exerts a higher surface tension tug, pulling the propylene droplet along. In another experiment, researchers showed how physically separated droplets could align themselves using ever-so-slight signals of evaporation. In a third experiment they used Sharpie pens to draw black lines on glass slides. The lines changed the surface of the slide and created a series of catch basins. The researchers filled each basin with fluids of different concentrations to create a self-sorting mechanism. Droplets bounced from reservoir to reservoir until they sensed the fluid that matched their concentration and merged with that pool. What started as a curiosity-driven project may also have many practical implications. The deep physical understanding of two component fluids allows the researchers to predict which fluids and surfaces will show these unusual effects. The effect is present on a large number of common surfaces and can be replicated with a number of chemical compounds.

The researchers said their newly designed antennas did a better job than previous spherical antennas at directing an ultra-narrow beam of light where it is needed, with little or no loss due to heating and scattering.  The cubes are composed of insulating materials, rather than the conducting or semiconducting materials used for the spherical versions, and are easier to fabricate as well as more effective,  Mr Sikdar said. In a paper published in the Journal of Applied Physics, Mr Sikdar explains that the nanocubes can be arranged in a chain, where the space between them and their number can be adjusted to fine-tune the focused light beam s width and intensity as needed for various applications. As the separation between cubes increases, the angular width of the beam narrows and directionality improves. ""Unidirectional nanoantennas induce directionality to any omnidirectional light emitters like microlasers, nanolasers or spasers, and even quantum dots,"" Mr Sikdar said. Spasers are similar to lasers, but employ minute oscillations of electrons rather than photons of light. Quantum dots, widely used in colour TVs, are tiny crystals that produce specific colours, based on their size. ""The cubic antennas focus light with precise control over direction and beam width,"" Mr Sikdar said.  They are like nanoscale spotlights.  The new cubic nanoantennas have the potential to revolutionise the infant field of nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS). ""These unidirectional nanoantennas are most suitable for integrated optics-based biosensors to detect proteins, DNA, antibodies, enzymes, etc, in truly portable lab-on-a-chip platforms of the future,"" Mr Sikdar said. ""They can also potentially replace the lossy on-chip IC (integrated circuit) interconnects, via transmitting optical signals within and among ICs, to ensure ultrafast data processing while minimising device heating."" The research team is now aiming at diverse practical applications of these tiny antennas.","Published: March 13, 2015"

However, compliance issues are also problematic in those territories, according to a recent study from Maetrics, a full-service life science consulting firm.  The medical device industry in the United Kingdom has been hit hard with spending cuts by the National Health Service and decreasing prices due in part to order pooling. Also distressing to this sector is stricter EU regulation: 61% of businesses responding to the Maetrics study cited unannounced inspections by notified bodies as a principal challenge for 2015.  With growth stymied at home, the medical device sector is looking to emerging markets for a boost. However, more than half of survey respondents said they had concerns about regulatory compliance. In addition, some 43% expressed concern about finding qualified staff for such ventures.   This is a historic and exciting time for the industry,  said Peter Rose, managing director at Maetrics.  Emerging market expansion offers an appealing solution for businesses that are feeling under pressure in mature markets, but ensuring compliance with different regulations is going to be tough.  Additional key findings include:    The introduction of Unique Device Identifiers (UDIs) will be one of the major challenges for 2015, especially for IT, according to 58% of medical device firms.    Product launches (48%) and new Medical Device Regulations (45%) also pose significant hurdles.    Across all UK healthcare and life science firms, respondents reveal lack of investment in compliance as businesses say they lack resources (68%), time (67%) and budget (65%).    61% report difficulties with implementing regulations to their specific environment.    60% say that regulations are hard to interpret and change often.   Having a strong quality and compliance team, whether internally or externally through a consulting partner, is more important now than ever before,  Rose continued.  It s clear that the key to fully leveraging the opportunities in emerging markets is confidence in interpreting and implementing regulations.  The study, conducted by leading business analyst MindMetre, surveyed more than 50 compliance and quality management professionals from four life sciences sectors, including pharmaceutical, medical device, biotechnology and nutrition   with participants from both large corporations and small to medium enterprises (SMEs)   to determine the industry outlook, examine growth drivers and provide insight into planning and buying behaviours.","Published: March 13, 2015"

Appearing online March 11, 2015, in the journal Nature, the researchers not only present survival data for a small, randomized and blinded patient trial, they also detail how the tetanus pre-conditioning technique works, providing a roadmap for enhancing dendritic cell immunotherapies that have shown promise treating the most lethal form of brain cancer.  Patients with glioblastoma usually survive for little more than one year. However, in patients who received the immunotherapy, half lived nearly five years or longer from their diagnosis, so the findings are promising and significant,  said senior author John Sampson, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the Division of Neurosurgery at Duke University Medical Center. The researchers built the study on earlier findings that glioblastoma tumors harbor a strain of cytomegalovirus (CMV) that is not present in the surrounding brain tissue, creating a natural target for an immune therapy. One such targeted approach uses dendritic cells, which train the immune system to respond to specific pathogens. The Duke research team developed a process to extract white blood cells, coax the growth of dendritic cells and load them with the viral antigens. Armed with these marching orders, the dendritic cells are injected back into the cancer patients, where they head to the lymph nodes and signal the immune fighters to search and attack the CMV-laden tumor. This immunotherapy worked well, but researchers sought additional gains. So they looked for a way to prime the immune system to be on high alert prior to the infusion of dendritic cells. They chose to use a shot of tetanus/diphtheria toxoid -- which is widely available and safe as a clinically approved vaccine   to incite the troops of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes. In a small human study, they enrolled 12 brain tumor patients, with half randomly assigned to receive a tetanus booster and the other half a placebo injection. The next day, patients in both groups were then given the dendritic cell immunotherapy. Researchers did not know which therapies the patients received. Patients randomized to get a tetanus shot showed a significant increase in survival from the time of pre-conditioning compared to patients receiving just the dendritic cell therapy, with half living from 51 to 101 months, compared to 11.6 months for the comparison group. One patient from the tetanus group continues to have no tumor growth and is still alive at eight years after the treatment.  These findings have potential relevance for improving dendritic cell vaccines not only for patients with glioblastoma, but also in the immunologic targeting of other cancers,  said co-lead and co-corresponding author, Duane A. Mitchell, M.D., Ph.D., currently director of the University of Florida brain tumor immunotherapy program.  We are obviously pursuing larger-scale confirmatory studies, but are very encouraged by these data and the future applicability.  The researchers used mouse studies to track how the immunotherapy worked. They identified a new role for an immune signaling protein called CCL3, which had previously been known for mediating other immune activities, but had not been associated with creating increased migration of dendritic cells to the lymph nodes. The protein was found to work systemically, not just at the injection site.  The fact that both mice given tetanus and our patients had elevated CCL3 prompted us to investigate the role of this protein in the mechanism, which in turn revealed that both CCL3 and the recall responses from tetanus boosting needed to work together to increase the migration of our vaccines,  said co-lead author Kristen A. Batich, a Duke M.D./Ph.D. candidate.   While dendritic cell vaccines have shown some promise in the treatment of patients with advanced cancers, including glioblastoma, the dynamics of this process have not been well understood,  Sampson said.  Our work identifies an immunologic interaction whereby recall responses to one antigen   tetanus - can influence the migratory capacity of dendritic cells loaded with different antigens   CMV.  The researchers plan a new study to determine whether successful dendritic cell migration could be used as a prognostic indicator of patient survival.  Our study indicates that dendritic cell migration to the lymph nodes can be improved significantly by pre-conditioning the vaccine site with a tetanus boost, and this appears to improve antitumor responses and prolonged survival,  Batich said.

Although approximately 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer s, no reliable blood-based test currently exists for the neurodegenerative disorder that is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. Using blood-based biomarkers   a signature of proteins in the blood that indicate the presence of a disease   to diagnose Alzheimer s could be a key advance.  Blood-based biomarkers would have the important advantage of being safe, affordable and easy to administer in large groups or in rural areas, and therefore could have an enormous impact on clinical care and clinical trials alike,  said Dr. Liana Apostolova, director of the neuroimaging laboratory at the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer s Disease Research at UCLA and head of the research team. Results of the study appeared in the journal Neurology. Alzheimer s disease can be diagnosed definitively only by examining brain tissue after death. While people are alive, physicians must rely on proxy measures, or biomarkers, along with cognitive symptoms such as memory loss. Two current methods for determining the beta-amyloid formation characteristic of Alzheimer s disease both have drawbacks. Cerebrospinal fluid can be obtained from patients, but that requires a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that carries the risk of nerve damage and other serious side effects. Another method, the amyloid PET scan, while effective, exposes subjects to radiation. The PET scan is also expensive and is not typically covered by insurance as a diagnostic test. Also, few medical centers have the technology. For their study, the UCLA researchers developed a simple signature for predicting the presence of brain amyloidosis   the build-up of amyloid in the brain   including several blood proteins known to be associated with Alzheimer s disease, along with information routinely obtained in the course of a clinical work-up for patients suspected to have the disease, such as results of memory testing and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Using blood samples and other data from patients with mild cognitive impairment from the Alzheimer s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative   a large public-private partnership that began in 2004   the UCLA researchers found that their method could be used to predict the presence of amyloid in the brain with modest accuracy.  Our study suggests that blood protein panels can be used to establish the presence of Alzheimer s-type pathology of the brain in a safe and minimally invasive manner,  Apostolova said.  We need to further refine and improve on the power of this signature by introducing new disease-related metrics, but this indicates that such a test is feasible and could be on the market before long.  Although there is no treatment that can halt or reverse the progression of Alzheimer s disease, a non-invasive, inexpensive and reliable test for diagnosing the disease could spare people with dementia and their families the anxiety associated with uncertainty, direct them to support services earlier, and improve their likelihood of benefiting from current and future advances in treatment. Such a test would also have a major impact on research.  With the advent of the amyloid PET scan we are learning that as many as 25-30 percent of subjects who enroll in Alzheimer s disease clinical trials turn out not to have the disease,  said Apostolova.  That makes it difficult to measure the effects of the treatment being tested.

Molecular messages, which control the cellular machinery both sides need, are vulnerable to interception or forgery. New research at Rockefeller University has revealed the unique twist on just such a strategy deployed by the liver-infecting Hepatitis C virus   one that may help explain the progression of liver disease and that the researchers suspect may be found more widely in the world of disease-causing viruses. Led jointly by Charles Rice, the Maurice R. and Corinne P. Greenberg Professor in Virology and head of the Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease and Robert Darnell, Senior Attending Physician, Robert and Harriet Heilbrunn Professor, and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Neuro-oncology, the research is described March 12 in Cell. It employed a powerful combination of techniques to map the interactions between the virus and a small piece of genetic material   known as miRNA-122   that is produced almost exclusively by liver cells, which normally use it to regulate expression of their own genes.  It is well known that once inside a liver cell, the hepatitis C virus must bind to miRNA-122 in order to establish a persistent infection. We found an unanticipated consequence of this interaction: By binding to miRNA-122, the virus acts like a sponge, soaking up these gene-regulating molecules,  says first author Joseph Luna, a graduate student with a joint appointment in the labs.  Our experiments showed this has the effect of skewing gene activity in infected liver cells.  The fight between an infecting virus and its host is often viewed as proteins fighting like soldiers. And soldiers on both sides must have orders, in this case the genetic information responsible for the production of proteins, Luna explains. This is where miRNA-122 comes in. It is a microRNA, a type of RNA encoded into the genome for the purpose of turning down the expression of genes. It does this job by guiding a complex of silencing proteins to an RNA transcript of a gene so as to prevent it from being turned into a protein. In this way, miRNA-122 appears to help control a number of normal functions, including cholesterol and iron metabolism, as well as circadian rhythms. But miRNA-122 is also necessary for hepatitis C virus. Once in a liver cell, the viral RNA binds with miRNA-122, which stabilizes and protects the virus so it can replicate. Over the long term, the hepatitis C virus infections can lead to scarring of the liver and liver cancer. In order to explore how the hepatitis C virus and miRNA-122 interact and the repercussions for the host liver cells, the researchers used a technique known as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP), developed over the past 12 years by the Darnell lab, which was targeted to find Argonaute, one of the proteins involved in silencing. This way, they captured the miRNA-122/Argonaute complexes and the sections of RNA transcript to which they bound. They then sequenced those RNA transcripts to see what genetic instructions they represented.  One microRNA can have hundreds of targets, but most often studies are driven by anecdotes focused on single interactions. By combining CLIP and RNA sequencing, however, we were able to take a global perspective and map out all of miRNA-122 s interactions across both the viral and infected host genomes,  says study author Robert Darnell, who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator.  The result is a rigorously constructed picture of what is actually going on in the cell.  Their maps showed a peak in miRNA-122 binding at one end of the viral genome, confirming previous work; miRNA-122 also interacted with the virus in a number of other places, for which the significance is not yet known. When the researchers looked at miRNA-122 interactions in an infected cell, they found lower levels as compared to uninfected cells. What s more, a look at the expression of genes regulated by miRNA-122 confirmed this microRNA was less active because those genes had higher levels of activity.  What if chronic low levels of miRNA-122 prompt changes that, over years, contribute to liver damage and cancer? This could be a molecular link between the viral infection and the pathologies associated with hepatitis C,  Luna says.  More work on miRNA-122 targets in hepatitis C-infected patients may clarify why some go on to develop liver cancer and others don t.  The hepatitis C virus isn t the only virus known to alter gene expression in host cells by sponging up their microRNAs.  Human cytomegalovirus and herpesvirus saimiri, which infects New World monkeys, employ a similar strategy, producing RNAs specifically to bind up host microRNAs. But, unlike the others, the hepatitis C virus must bind to a microRNA to replicate, and when it does so, the new viral genomes sop up even more miRNA-122, creating a positive feedback.  We suspect these three cases may just be the tip of the iceberg, that other viruses   perhaps those that replicate much more ferociously   may use similar microRNA-sponging strategies,  study author Charles Rice says.  The techniques we used will make it possible to investigate the use of this strategy in an unbiased way. ","Published: March 13, 2015"

Despite its public health burden, awareness and treatment of CKD remain low - especially in communities most affected by the disease. Many with CKD who need treatment do not receive it. And many with key risk factors like diabetes and high blood pressure don t know they are at risk. In observance of World Kidney Day 2015 on March 12, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) at the National Institutes of Health is proud to join organizations across the globe in seeking kidney health for all. Toward this goal, NIDDK supports research to improve outcomes for people with CKD and those at risk. Through research that tests new ways to deliver care, NIDDK strives to identify better ways to manage kidney disease and broaden access to quality care. This research includes clinical trials testing simple changes in care to identify cost-effective practices that may significantly improve outcomes for all people with or at risk for CKD. Among these trials:   The Cleveland Clinic is testing whether patient navigators - health care workers who assist people in coordinating their care - can also help them stick to prescribed treatments and overcome barriers to care.  Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, are working with clinics that provide services to medically underserved populations to find ways to better manage CKD care and reduce care inequality.  Researchers at Duke University are studying an automated population program to help identify, monitor and engage people with diabetic kidney disease in their own care through electronic health reminders.  The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas is looking at innovative ways to use electronic medical records to improve care for people with diabetes, hypertension and kidney disease. Primary care and community health settings can reach people at risk for progressive CKD early - when treatments have the best chance of slowing kidney damage. To that end, NIDDK promotes CKD education, screening and management in primary care and community settings through the NIDDK s National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP). NKDEP brings kidney health information and resources to high-risk groups - including African Americans and Hispanics - and to their health care providers in a variety of ways, including:   Through clinical tools, training programs and reference materials, NKDEP equips a broad array of primary care clinicians with the evidence-based information and resources they need to effectively care for patients with CKD.  NKDEP s Ri ones, Tesoros (Kidneys, Treasures) Education Program for Community Health Workers helps fill the kidney disease education gap within the Hispanic community by preparing these workers to educate Hispanics with diabetes about their risk for CKD and how to keep their kidneys healthy.  NKDEP works with grassroots partners - like Chi Eta Phi Nursing Sorority - to execute the Kidney Sundays(PDF - 695KB) program, which helps faith leaders bring kidney health messages to their communities. Kidney Sundays has reached nearly 450,000 congregants. To truly achieve kidney health for all, countries must collaborate and learn from one another. Applying effective NIDDK efforts abroad may help slow disease progression and reduce the global CKD burden. In turn, NIDDK hopes to continue to learn from successful international CKD initiatives and test their efficacy in the United States.","Published: March 13, 2015"

The results were published on-line in PLoS One. BL-9020 is a novel monoclonal antibody treatment designed to prevent immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. It was developed to treat Type 1 diabetes in early stage patients, during what is known as the ""honeymoon period,"" where the pancreatic beta cells have not been completely destroyed and continue to secrete insulin. BL-9020 targets NKp46, a unique target that is involved in the innate response against the pancreas. Pre-clinical studies in mouse models of Type 1 diabetes suggest that BL-9020 can inhibit beta cell death, thus preventing full maturation of the disease. This effect could significantly delay, and potentially prevent, the need for chronic insulin use by Type 1 diabetes patients, as well as provide a potential benefit in minimizing diabetes-related complications. The new set of experiments shows that BL-9020 led to decreased levels of its target, NKp46, on murine NK cells, and specifically reduces the cytotoxic activity mediated by NKp46 in these cells. Consequently, BL-9020 significantly delayed the onset of diabetes and lowered the incidence of Type 1 diabetes in two different mouse models of diabetes. After a single treatment of BL-9020, hyperglycemia was significantly less severe. Moreover, following a repeated long-term treatment regimen of pre-diabetic mice, 70% of mice treated with BL-9020 remained diabetes-free throughout the experiment (25 weeks), compared to only 30% of control-treated mice. Dr. Kinneret Savitsky, CEO of BioLineRx, stated, ""We are greatly encouraged by these pre-clinical studies, showing that BL-9020 is able to delay the development of Type 1 diabetes in pre-diabetic mice. Type 1 diabetes is a highly prevalent autoimmune disease affecting millions around the world. Currently there is no cure for the disease, and patients with diabetes need to administer insulin on a daily basis throughout their lifetime. Many patients experience a ""honeymoon period"" following diagnosis which may last up to a year and can offer an opportunity for disease modifying therapies. Inhibiting the innate immune system, which has shown involvement in the destruction of the pancreas, is a novel approach for such treatment. In light of these promising pre-clinical results, we hope that BL-9020 will eventually be able to improve the quality of life for millions of children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.  As previously disclosed, in January 2014, BioLineRx entered into a collaboration agreement with JHL Biotech to collaborate in the development and commercialization of BL-9020. Pursuant to the collaboration agreement, JHL Biotech is responsible for all process development and manufacturing of BL-9020 during its pre-clinical and clinical development stages, and BioLineRx is responsible for all pre-clinical development of BL-9020. Responsibility for clinical development of the product will be shared by the parties on a regional basis.","Published: March 13, 2015"

The treatment has been developed by Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, with early development work carried out using MRC Technology s antibody humanization expertise. Pembrolizumab is considered a next generation drug in cancer care, stimulating the body s immune system to fight the disease. The therapeutic is one of a new generation of PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) therapies that block the biological pathways cancers use to disguise themselves from the immune system. It acts by making the cancer cell  visible  to the immune system and the cell can thus be destroyed by the body s natural defence mechanisms. UK based scientists at MRCT, with extensive expertise in antibody engineering techniques, first advanced the antibody-based treatment and carried out humanization, an essential step in the success of the therapeutic. EAMS is a new NHS system enabling drugs to be fast-tracked to patients. The scheme has been set up to give severely ill patients rapid access to promising unlicensed medicines, meaning that this drug is available to be prescribed to patients much earlier than it would normally have been before EAMS was established. Dave Tapolczay, Chief Executive Officer, MRC Technology said:  We are very proud of our role in bringing this new cancer treatment to patients with highly invasive tumours. Making pembrolizumab available under the Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS) is another big step in getting healthcare innovation to patients sooner and underlines our commitment to improving lives through science.  Dr Justin Bryans, Director of Drug Discovery, MRC Technology said:  Pembrolizumab is different from other cancer drugs, as it boosts the immune system to launch an attack on cancer cells, rather than destroying cancer cells directly. MRC Technology scientists humanized the antibody so it would not be recognized and hence destroyed by the immune system. The PD-1 pathway allows cancer cells to escape detection by the body s immune response. The antibody blocks this pathway leaving cancer cells susceptible to attack and destruction by the immune system.  MRC Technology has humanized over 55 antibodies to date, including four marketed products, Tysabri (natalizumab), Actemra (tocilizumab), Entyvio (vedolizumab) and Keytruda (pembrolizumab). A further five are in clinical trials and two more in preclinical studies. Pembrolizumab received FDA (USA) approval in September 2014 and is commercially available in the United States as Keytruda. An application for European (EMA) approval was made in June 2014.","Published: March 13, 2015"

Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed. The work will focus on supporting the validation of a Cancer Research UK SMP Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) targeted enrichment panel, using Horizon s HDx human genomic Reference Materials. The NGS project involves multi-gene, multi-aberration tumor analysis and is being run in CPA, GLP and ISO accredited laboratories, with a UK NEQAS (www.ukneqas.org.uk) quality assessment. These Reference Materials will support run-to-run and lab-to-lab longitudinal assessment of performance of the NGS technology. In Phase Two of the SMP, Cancer Research UK will work with the national Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre (ECMC) network and national genetic testing laboratories to develop a national screening programme for lung cancer samples in the NHS. Once screened, these results will be used to place patients on the National Lung Matrix Trial, run by the Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit (CRCTU) in Birmingham, and led by Prof. Gary Middleton. The scope of the project involves Horizon s Diagnostics business unit providing renewable, genetically defined Reference Materials representing a range of genetic aberrations and containing defined allelic mutation frequencies. The Reference Materials developed will enable reliable comparison of assay performance across sequencing platforms, targeted assays and laboratories by providing a common universal reference point. Many factors contribute to variability in the quality of clinical samples, which is currently a concern within molecular pathology laboratories working towards the clinical application of NGS panels for tumor screening. To address this, Cancer Research UK will use Horizon s precisely defined formalin compromised Reference Standards to assess the performance of Cancer Research UK s-SMP NGS, in order to inform any necessary changes in clinical practice surrounding preparation of FFPE samples for downstream NGS analysis. Dr Paul Morrill, President, Products, Horizon Discovery, said:  Research programs such as Cancer Research UK s Stratified Medicine Programme form a vital piece of the puzzle in the drive toward personalized, or stratified, medicine as a routine approach for the testing and treatment of cancer.

Published in the February issue of the journal Pain, the study shows that the neural pathways that transmit feelings of fatigue to the brain might be to blame. In those with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), the pathways do their job too well. The findings also provide evidence for the first time that peripheral tissues such as muscles contribute to feelings of fatigue. Determining the origins of fatigue could help researchers develop therapies or identify targets for those therapies. Researchers focused on the role of muscle metabolites, including lactic acid and adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, in the disease. The study has demonstrated for the first time that these substances, released when a person exercises his or her muscles, seem to activate these neural pathways. Also, UF Health researchers have shown that these pathways seem to be much more sensitive in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome than in patients without the disease, something that hasn t been studied before. Chronic fatigue syndrome, which the Institute of Medicine recently renamed systemic exertion intolerance disease, or SEID, is characterized by extreme chronic fatigue. Because its chief symptom -- fatigue -- is often associated with many other diseases, it can be difficult to diagnose SEID for the more than 1 million people who actually have the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease has no root medical cause, and researchers don t know what triggers it. But they are studying aspects of the disease to figure out ways to treat it.  What we have shown now, that has never been shown before in humans, is that muscle metabolites can induce fatigue in healthy people as well as patients who already have fatigue,  said Dr. Roland Staud, a professor of rheumatology and clinical immunology in the UF College of Medicine and the paper s lead author. During exercise, muscles produce metabolites, which are sensed by metaboreceptors that transmit information via fatigue pathways to the brain, according to the researchers. But in patients with SEID, these fatigue pathways have become highly sensitive to metabolites and can trigger excessive feelings of fatigue.  For most of us, at the end of strenuous exertion we feel exhausted and need to stop   but we will recover rapidly,  Staud said.  However, these individuals tire much more rapidly and sometimes just after moving across a room, they are fully exhausted. This takes a toll on their lives.  Staud and co-author Michael E. Robinson, a professor in the department of clinical and health psychology in the UF College of Public Health and Health Professions, recruited a group of 39 patients with SEID and 29 participants without the disease. The researchers asked the participants to don a blood pressure cuff just above their elbows on their dominant side, pick up a spring-loaded device and squeeze it to 100 percent of their maximum capacity, which was measured by a dial. With research assistants encouraging them, the study participants then squeezed the device so that the dial showed they were gripping at 50 percent of their maximum capacity for as long as they could. At the end of the hand-grip exercise, the blood pressure cuff on the participant s arm was inflated, almost instantly trapping the metabolites generated by the exercise within the forearm muscles. This allowed the metabolites to collect in the forearm tissue without being cleared by the circulatory system. There, the metabolites continued to activate fatigue pathways, sending messages of fatigue to the brain and allowing researchers to measure how much fatigue and pain may occur because of the trapped metabolites. With the blood pressure cuff still inflated, the participants rated fatigue and then pain in their forearms every 30 seconds. Both patients with SEID and patients without the disease reported increasing fatigue, but patients with the disease recorded much higher levels of fatigue and pain.  We found that the fatigued individuals reported more fatigue than the non-fatigued individuals during the exercise, and also found that they had more pain compared to the non-fatigued individuals,  Staud said. On the Fatigue Visual Analog Scale used to measure participants  fatigue, patients with SEID rated their fatigue at approximately 5.5 on a scale of 0 to 10 after the hand-grip exercise while wearing the inflated blood pressure cuff, whereas participants without the disease rated their fatigue at approximately 1.5. After 30 minutes, the participants repeated the exercise, but with the opposite arm and without the cinching blood pressure cuff so the metabolites could be cleared from the arm. Both sets of participants experienced fatigue, but the feeling of fatigue in those with the disease was much lower than when the metabolites were trapped with the blood pressure cuff.  This suggests that hypersensitive fatigue pathways play an important role for the often pronounced exercise-related fatigue of patients with the disease,  Staud said. Next, Staud plans to explore treatment interventions and to conduct brain-imaging studies of patients with SEID.  The take-home message here is, like many of the pain studies we have conducted, there are both peripheral and central nervous system factors at play in these complex syndromes,  said Robinson, who is also the director of the UF Center for Pain Research and Behavioral Health.  Our study seems to highlight the important role of these peripheral tissues.  University of Florida   press release Roland Staud, Meriem Mokthech, Donald D. Price, Michael E. Robinson.

The research, conducted by Polina Anikeeva, an assistant professor of materials science and engineering, graduate student Ritchie Chen, and three others, has been published in the journal Science. Previous efforts to stimulate the brain using pulses of electricity have proven effective in reducing or eliminating tremors associated with Parkinson s disease, but the treatment has remained a last resort because it requires highly invasive implanted wires that connect to a power source outside the brain.  In the future, our technique may provide an implant-free means to provide brain stimulation and mapping,  Anikeeva says. In their study, the team injected magnetic iron oxide particles just 22 nanometers in diameter into the brain. When exposed to an external alternating magnetic field   which can penetrate deep inside biological tissues  these particles rapidly heat up. The resulting local temperature increase can then lead to neural activation by triggering heat-sensitive capsaicin receptors   the same proteins that the body uses to detect both actual heat and the  heat  of spicy foods. (Capsaicin is the chemical that gives hot peppers their searing taste.) Anikeeva s team used viral gene delivery to induce the sensitivity to heat in selected neurons in the brain. The particles, which have virtually no interaction with biological tissues except when heated, tend to remain where they re placed, allowing for long-term treatment without the need for further invasive procedures.  The nanoparticles integrate into the tissue and remain largely intact,  Anikeeva says.  Then, that region can be stimulated at will by externally applying an alternating magnetic field. The goal for us was to figure out whether we could deliver stimuli to the nervous system in a wireless and noninvasive way.  The new work has proven that the approach is feasible, but much work remains to turn this proof-of-concept into a practical method for brain research or clinical treatment. The use of magnetic fields and injected particles has been an active area of cancer research; the thought is that this approach could destroy cancer cells by heating them.  The new technique is derived, in part, from that research,  Anikeeva says.  By calibrating the delivered thermal dosage, we can excite neurons without killing them. The magnetic nanoparticles also have been used for decades as contrast agents in MRI scans, so they are considered relatively safe in the human body.  The team developed ways to make the particles with precisely controlled sizes and shapes, in order to maximize their interaction with the applied alternating magnetic field. They also developed devices to deliver the applied magnetic field: Existing devices for cancer treatment   intended to produce much more intense heating   were far too big and energy-inefficient for this application. The next step toward making this a practical technology for clinical use in humans  is to understand better how our method works through neural recordings and behavioral experiments, and assess whether there are any other side effects to tissues in the affected area,  Anikeeva says. This is  a completely novel approach for deep-brain stimulation,  says Bianxiao Cui, an assistant professor of chemistry at Stanford University who was not involved in this research.  The new method is significant in that it is relatively more easily administered and induces less brain-tissue responses as compared with electrode implantation. More importantly, the stimulation could be remotely controlled, a highly appealing feature for deep-brain stimulation.  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Original reporting by: David L.

The re-growth of their long nerve fibers is hindered by scar tissue and molecular processes inside the nerves. An international team of researchers led by DZNE (German Center for Neurodegenerative Disease within the Helmoltz Association) scientists in Bonn now reports in Science that help might be on the way from an unexpected quarter: in animal studies, the cancer drug epothilone reduced the formation of scar tissue in injuries to the spinal cord and stimulated growth in damaged nerve cells. Both promoted neuronal regeneration and improved the animals' motor skills. Nerve cells are wire-like conductors that transmit and receive signals in the form of electrical impulses. This function can be impaired by accidents or disease. Whether or not the affected nerves can recover largely depends on their location: for instance nerve cells in the limbs, torso and nose can regenerate to some degree and regain some or all of their function. In contrast, the neurons in the brain and spinal cord do not have this ability. If they are damaged by accident or disease, the patient is likely to suffer long-term paralysis or other disabilities. But why is regeneration of these neurons and their long nerve fibers impeded? It is already known that inhibiting factors in newly formed scar tissue and other cellular processes block axon re-growth. ""The ideal treatment for promoting axon regeneration after spinal cord injury would inhibit the formation of scar tissue,"" says Professor Frank Bradke, who leads a working group at the DZNE's site in Bonn and who conducted the study. ""However, it is also important that the growth-inhibiting factors are neutralized while reactivating the poor axons' regenerative potential."" A feasible administration of a potential treatment is also essential for clinical application. In cooperation with international researchers, Bradke and his team have now managed to take another step towards the development of a future treatment. From their previous research, it was already known that stabilizing microtubules would reduce the formation of scar tissue and promote axonal growth. Microtubules are long, tubular filaments inside the cell that can grow and shrink dynamically. They are part of the cell's supportive skeleton, which also controls cell growth and movement. The substance epothilone can stabilize microtubules and is already licensed on the American market - as a cancer treatment. ""It all depends on the dose,"" says Dr. J rg Ruschel, the study's lead author. ""In higher doses, epothilone inhibits the growth of cancer cells, while low doses have been shown to stimulate axonal growth in animals without the severe side-effects of cancer treatment."" Epothilone is superior to other cancer drugs with a similar effect because it can penetrate the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system, thus reaching the damaged axons directly. Experiments have shown epothilone works on several levels. Epothilone reduces the growth of scar tissue by inhibiting the formation of microtubules in the cells that form the scar tissue. Therefore they cannot migrate to the spinal cord lesion and cause wound scarring. At the same time, epothilone promotes growth and regeneration in the nerve cells by causing microtubules to grow into the damaged axon tips. In short: through the same effect, namely microtubule stabilization, epothilone is able to inhibit directional movement in scar-forming cells while stimulating active growth in nerve cell axons. The animals treated with epothilone after spinal cord injury walked better than those that received no treatment, due to improved balance and coordination. The next goal of Bradke and his team is to test the effect of epothilone on various types of lesion. DZNE   press release J rg Ruschel, Farida Hellal, Kevin C. Flynn, Sebastian Dupraz, David A.

The mutations disrupt the electrical balance in the brain in two ways. In some patients, the flow of potassium is greatly reduced; while in others, it is raised enormously. Both states can lead to hard-to-treat epileptic seizures - and this can cause mental and motor development to come to a stop, or even to regress. These findings were made by a group of European scientists led by researchers at the Universities of Leipzig and T bingen. Their results are published in the journal Nature Genetics. Among the things the brain needs in order to function is the interaction of many different ion channels, which regulate electrical signals by keeping a delicate balance between the influences which make cells rest or become excited. The ion channels are located in the cell wall of a neuron, together with many other pores and channels.  The potassium channel KCNA2 is one of many channels. It regulates the flow of potassium ions by opening and shutting, thereby also regulating the electrical excitability of the neurons in the brain,  explains Professor Johannes Lemke, head of Leipzig University Hospitals  Institute of Human Genetics. Mutations in various ion channels are one of the main causes of epilepsy.  That is why identifying each mutation in the ion channel is important for diagnosing the individual epilepsy syndrome and finding ways of treating it,  says Professor Holger Lerche, of T bingen s Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research (HIH) and medical director of Neurology and Epileptology at the T bingen University Hospitals. The researchers discovered that the mutations disrupted the ion channel s function either by cutting the flow of potassium, leading to a loss of function; or by increasing potassium flow, leading to an excess gain of function. Patients demonstrating a loss of function had their first epileptic seizures starting at the age of around one, but the attacks ceased during childhood or in the patient s teenage years. For patients with increased function, however, epileptic seizures began even earlier and recurred into adulthood. The degree of mental disability and related problems was greater in the latter group. The types of early-childhood-onset epilepsy caused by potassium ion channel mutations comprise a field of study all their own within epileptic encephalopathy, the severe epilepsies which start early in life and which are linked with various degrees of developmental disruptions, reduced intelligence and other neuropsychiatric symptoms such as autism and disruptions to voluntary muscle coordination (ataxia). For patients whose potassium flows are too high, there is an immediate treatment option in the form of 4-Aminopyridin, an approved drug which specifically blocks the relevant ion channel. This treatment is to be applied. The researchers and doctors hope it will lead to a reduction of seizures and improved mental abilities. However, the treatment cannot correct severe mental retardation due to faulty neural networks or deformed neurons caused during the development of the brain. For this reason, it is important to identify the genetic defects as early as possible in the brain - so as to prevent developmental retardation as far as possible. As to the patients with a loss of function in their potassium flows, the researchers aim to conduct further experiments into exactly how the epileptic seizures arise - so as to find new ways of treating the disorder. Then they would be able to improve the lot of a small proportion of patients with epileptic ecephalopathy with improved and individualized therapies.

Although approximately 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's, no reliable blood-based test currently exists for the neurodegenerative disorder that is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. Using blood-based biomarkers -- a signature of proteins in the blood that indicate the presence of a disease -- to diagnose Alzheimer's could be a key advance. ""Blood-based biomarkers would have the important advantage of being safe, affordable and easy to administer in large groups or in rural areas, and therefore could have an enormous impact on clinical care and clinical trials alike,"" said Dr. Liana G. Apostolova, director of the neuroimaging laboratory at the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer's Disease Research at UCLA and head of the research team. Results of the study appeared in the journal Neurology. Alzheimer's disease can be diagnosed definitively only by examining brain tissue after death. While people are alive, physicians must rely on proxy measures, or biomarkers, along with cognitive symptoms such as memory loss. Two current methods for determining the beta-amyloid formation characteristic of Alzheimer's disease both have drawbacks. Cerebrospinal fluid can be obtained from patients, but that requires a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that carries the risk of nerve damage and other serious side effects. Another method, the amyloid PET scan, while effective, exposes subjects to radiation. The PET scan is also expensive and is not typically covered by insurance as a diagnostic test. Also, few medical centers have the technology. For their study, the UCLA researchers developed a simple signature for predicting the presence of brain amyloidosis -- the build-up of amyloid in the brain -- including several blood proteins known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease, along with information routinely obtained in the course of a clinical work-up for patients suspected to have the disease, such as results of memory testing and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Using blood samples and other data from patients with mild cognitive impairment from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative -- a large public-private partnership that began in 2004 -- the UCLA researchers found that their method could be used to predict the presence of amyloid in the brain with modest accuracy. ""Our study suggests that blood protein panels can be used to establish the presence of Alzheimer's-type pathology of the brain in a safe and minimally invasive manner,"" Apostolova said. ""We need to further refine and improve on the power of this signature by introducing new disease-related metrics, but this indicates that such a test is feasible and could be on the market before long."" Although there is no treatment that can halt or reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease, a non-invasive, inexpensive and reliable test for diagnosing the disease could spare people with dementia and their families the anxiety associated with uncertainty, direct them to support services earlier, and improve their likelihood of benefiting from current and future advances in treatment. Such a test would also have a major impact on research. ""With the advent of the amyloid PET scan we are learning that as many as 25-30 percent of subjects who enroll in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials turn out not to have the disease,"" said Apostolova.

In a new study, published in Neuron, scientists replaced the normal mouse presenilin-1 gene with Alzheimer's-causing forms of the human gene to discover how these genetic changes may lead to the disorder. Their surprising results may transform the way scientists design drugs that target these mutations to treat inherited or familial Alzheimer's, a rare form of the disease that affects approximately 1 percent of people with the disorder. The study was partially funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health. For decades, it has been unclear exactly how the presenilin mutations cause Alzheimer's disease. Presenilin is a component of an important enzyme, gamma secretase, which cuts up amyloid precursor protein into two protein fragments, Abeta40 and Abeta42. Abeta42 is found in plaques, the abnormal accumulations of protein in the brain which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's. Numerous studies suggested that presenilin-1 mutations increased activity of gamma-secretase. Investigators have developed drugs that block gamma-secretase, but they have so far failed in clinical trials to halt the disease. The study led by Raymond Kelleher, M.D., Ph.D. and Jie Shen, Ph.D., professors of neurology at Harvard Medical School, Boston, provides a plot twist in the association of presenilin-1 mutations and inherited Alzheimer's disease. Using mice with altered forms of the presenilin gene, Drs. Kelleher and Shen discovered that the mutations may cause the disease by decreasing, rather than increasing, the activity of gamma-secretase. One of the presenilin mutations also caused impairment of memory circuits in the mouse brain and age-dependent death of neurons. ""The findings by Drs. Shen and Kelleher are a significant departure from conventional thinking that should open up exciting and creative new possibilities at all levels of research, from basic molecular mechanisms all the way to clinical intervention,"" said Roderick Corriveau, Ph.D., program director at NINDS. ""This is a very striking example where we have mutations that inactivate gamma-secretase function and yet they trigger an array of features that resemble Alzheimer's disease, notably synaptic and cognitive deficits as well as neurodegeneration,"" said Dr. Kelleher. Although plaques are the main biological indicator of Alzheimer's, neurodegenerative changes are also an important feature of the disease. These changes include loss of brain cells, cognitive deficits such as problems with memory, changes in the brain's electrical activity and inflammation. Commonly used mouse models of the disease exhibit excessive plaque deposition, but do not show symptoms of neurodegeneration. According to Dr. Kelleher, this may be one reason that treatments developed in mice have not been successful in patients. ""This study is the first example of a mouse model in which a familial Alzheimer's mutation is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration. The new model provides an opportunity that we hope will help with the development of therapies focusing on the devastating neurodegenerative changes that occur in the disease,"" Dr. Kelleher said. Dr. Shen's previous work demonstrated that presenilins and gamma-secretase play an important role in learning and memory, communication between brain cells and neuronal survival, and cautioned against the use of gamma-secretase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease therapy. Later, a large phase III trial was stopped because treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor worsened the cognitive ability of patients. Although the majority of cases are not inherited, familial Alzheimer's disease is associated with early onset of the disorder, with symptoms often appearing before age 60. Drs. Shen and Kelleher hope that the mechanisms uncovered in this study may provide insight into the common forms of the disorder that affect more than five million people in the United States. The results in this paper suggest a new approach for drug development.

But they didn t know how exactly these things worked together. By studying ants, McGill researchers have identified a key mechanism by which environmental (or epigenetic) factors influence the expression of all of these traits, (along with many more).   They believe that, by identifying a key gene for each trait and how it is affected epigenetically (by the environment), it is potentially possible to influence the degree of its expression   and so create variation in how specific traits are expressed. It s a bit like an artist adding more or less white paint to black to create a palette of shades of gray.  In effect, it is the discovery of the mechanism through which the environment interacts with specific genes, revealing environmental factors as an equal partner in determining complex traits. A McGill team led by Profs. Moshe Szyf and Ehab Abouheif, from the McGill s Departments of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, and Biology respectively, has clearly identified a mechanism by which epigenetic factors   how the environment affects the expression of a single gene   have an overarching effect in creating quantitative variation in these kinds of complex traits. The researchers arrived at this conclusion by conducting epigenetic experiments on ants from the species Camponotus floridanus (better known as the Florida carpenter ant). Because there is little genetic influence in determining size variation of workers in a colony (they are on average 75 per cent related) and because their genome has already been sequenced it was possible for the researchers to focus on the effects of epigenetic factors in creating variations in size. The enviro-genetics of a superhero: Ant Man By increasing the degree of DNA methylation (a biochemical process that controls the expression of certain genes   a bit like a dimmer can turn a light up or down) of a gene involved in controlling growth called Egfr, they were able to create a spectrum of worker ant sizes despite the lack of genetic difference between one ant and the next. Essentially, the researchers found that the more methylated the gene, the larger the size of the ants.  Basically, what we found was a kind of cascading effect. By modifying the methylation of one particular gene, that affects others, in this case the Egfr gene, we could affect all the other genes involved in cellular growth. We were working with ants, but it was a bit like discovering that we could create shorter or taller human beings.  -- Sebastian Alvarado, the McGill PhD who is the co-first author on the study.  Finding the right gene to work on  In the case of growth in ants, it was the Egfr gene which was determinant. But for other complex traits, whether they are involved in the growth of cancer cells in humans or fat cells in chickens, what we now know is that once we have discovered, in each case, the key genetic position that is affected by epigenetic factors we can then influence how much or how little of the gene is expressed with potentially very far-reaching results.  -- Rajendhran Rajakumar, co-first author of the paper.  It s a discovery that completely changes our understanding of how human variation comes to be,  says Abouheif.  So many human traits, whether they are intelligence, height, or vulnerability to diseases such as cancer, exist along a continuum. If, as we believe, this epigenetic mechanism applies to a key gene in each area, the change is so enormous that it s hard to even imagine right now how it will influence research in everything from health to cognitive development to farming.

It is possible to relate the DNA of a species to its physical characteristics, or phenotypes, and identify areas of DNA responsible for desirable traits such as high yield or disease resistance. Crop breeding programmes can make use of this genetic information to ensure that the preferred trait is inherited by future crop yields, helping to secure future food supply. However, the majority of tools for the analysis of DNA are designed for diploid organisms, such as humans, with one set of chromosomes, and perform poorly when applied to polyploid species such as bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) which has multiple sets of chromosomes. Scientists from The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC) and John Innes Centre have developed a bioinformatics pipeline, PolyMarker that facilitates the design of genomic specific primers for polyploid species. Once identified, these primers can be used to ascertain whether or not an individual organism has the genetic variation associated with a given trait. As an open access tool, researchers and crop breeders can submit their own data to PolyMarker and the online tool will return suggested design primers to identify genetic variations that tag vital traits in their crop samples, with a significantly reduced turnaround time compared to the current manual method.  The process of manually designing primers to validate in hexaploid wheat is time consuming, with PolyMarker we have reduced the design time from around a week to twenty minutes,  said lead author Ricardo Ramirez-Gonzalez, PhD student at TGAC.  PolyMarker has already demonstrated its value having been developed and applied in a research project where it identified genetic markers that signal resistance to the wheat yellow rust pathogen (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici). This disease is responsible for devastating bread wheat crops and has developed  Warrior  strains capable of infecting individuals previously believed to have tolerance.  Mario Caccamo, senior author of the paper, said:  The development of PolyMarker is a great example of the benefits of multidisciplinary research. In one new software tool, we have applied expertise in advanced algorithm development, knowledge on genetics and principles of genome architecture.  The innovative online tool has also been used to identify 820,000 genetic markers for the current TransPlant project at TGAC, a European initiative aimed at the provision of a trans-national infrastructure for plant genomic science, as well as 80,000 markers for the CerealsDB project for the analysis of the wheat genome, in collaboration with the University of Bristol.","Published: March 12, 2015"

They showed that the receptor can trigger a defensive response and confers increased resistance to bacterial disease. The research findings demonstrate that the signalling pathways or circuitry downstream of the receptor are conserved between evolutionary distant monocots and dicots. Drs Henk-jan Schoonbeek and Christopher Ridout, the lead and corresponding authors of a paper published in The New Phytologist today, first developed diagnostic tools which tests wheat for responses to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These PAMPs are often essential parts of fungi or bacteria - they would find it difficult to mutate or lose them without affecting their fitness or survival. Pattern recognition receptors recognise and confer a response to such PAMPs and could contribute to durable resistance. The authors have demonstrated that wheat has the circuitry to respond to these pathogens but not all the antennae required to perceive pathogens most effectively. The JIC scientists worked with TSL and the crop transformation team at NIAB to transfer a receptor gene, EFR, conferring recognition of the widespread bacterial protein EF-Tu, from Arabidopsis to wheat, and used their diagnostic tools to show that the receptor was functional. EFR works like a new antenna that activates defence elements already present and makes the wheat plants more resistant to bacteria. Since EF-Tu is essential, the authors predict this type of resistance should be durable. EFR was first identified by Professor Cyril Zipfel, Head of TSL, and co-author of the paper. Prof Zipfel pioneered inter-species transfer of PRRs, and recently reported a converse transfer of a monocot PRR to dicot plants, further illustrating the ancient evolutionary conservation of immune signalling between these plant classes. Bacterial wheat diseases are widespread in Asia and Africa, and present in the USA. The diagnostic tool can be used immediately to help breeders screen seed varieties for PAMP recognition, and therefore resistance to multiple bacterial pathogens. Chris Ridout said:  Our work demonstrates the importance of developing this type of resistance in wheat. As the wheat genome is sequenced further and we continue our analysis of receptor genes in dicots, we hope to identify more genes that can be used to develop durable resistance, not only to bacterial diseases, but to the most important fungal pathogens of wheat such as yellow rust, Septoria and powdery mildew.  This research was funded by BBSRC. The research team also received support from The Gatsby Charitable Foundation and the Two Blades Foundation.","Published: March 12, 2015"

It sounds like science fiction, but Salk scientists have gotten one step closer to creating such a drug by customizing a powerful defense system used by many bacteria and training this scissor-like machinery to recognize the HIV virus.  Evolution has led to some of the most astonishing mechanisms for protecting organisms against their natural pathogens,  says Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor of Salk s Gene Expression Laboratory and senior author of the new work, published March 10, 2015 in Nature Communications.  Understanding the immune responses by which bacteria protect themselves against viral infections has allowed us to engineer novel platforms for the targeting of devastating viruses, such as HIV, in human patients.  When a copy of the HIV virus sneaks into a human cell, it can cause havoc. It co-opts the cell s own molecular machinery to made copies of the virus s genetic material and then buries these copies in the cell s own genes. From there, the host s cell becomes an HIV factory, making new copies of the virus to spread throughout the body. Existing HIV drugs target individual steps of this lifecycle; some stop the virus from integrating into cells  DNA, for instance, while others try to stop the affected cells from producing more virus. The problem with these drugs, explains Hsin-Kai (Ken) Liao, a research associate in the Izpisua Belmonte lab and first author of the new paper, is that they don t actually remove the copies of the virus that are hidden within cells  DNA. These copies can remain dormant for years and then activate again.  Patients normally need to take drugs every day or every week for their whole lives, because of the HIV that can be latent,  says Liao.  This costs money, time and effort.  To combat this problem, Liao and Izpisua Belmonte turned to a molecular defense system called CRISPR that bacteria use to cut up foreign DNA at specified spots. Since its recent discovery, scientists have started using CRISPR to edit genes. But Liao and Izpisua Belmonte were also intrigued by its defensive ability and wondered if CRISPR could be programmed to slice and destroy viruses inside human cells. CRISPR uses bits of genetic material called guide RNAs to dictate its cuts, so the scientists developed guide RNAs that bound to unique spots on the HIV virus. They added CRISPR, the guide RNAs and other molecules needed for the system to work to immune cells that had been infected with HIV, and found that CRISPR successfully cut the right spots in HIV s genes, inactivating the virus. This resulted in the virus being completely removed from up to 72 percent of cells. Not only did CRISPR chop up loose copies of the virus as they initially infected the cell, but it also cut up HIV that was hidden and dormant within the cells  DNA. While other research groups have taken similar approaches in targeting CRISPR to HIV, the new Salk study showed that the method is effective against active, full-length HIV rather than a shortened, inactive version of the virus. The Salk team also illustrated in a more complete way how CRISPR targets HIV in living human cells, verifying that it works both before and after the virus is embedded in the genome.  CRISPR can actually excise the virus out of the human genome,  Liao says. Next, Liao and his colleagues tried adding the CRISPR system to human cells before becoming infected with HIV. Having the system in place, they showed, prevented an infection CRISPR chopped up any copies of the virus before they could start replicating.  The main advantage of this technology is not only that viral DNA integrated into the human genome can be eliminated but perhaps, most importantly, the prophylactic application,  says Izpisua Belmonte.  By eliminating the virus at the early steps of its life cycle, we can altogether prevent the infection of human cells in an analogous manner to how conventional vaccines work.  Still, more research is needed to determine how the technology could be used in human patients and whether HIV will quickly evolve to escape CRISPR. With that in mind, the team is studying the effectiveness of adding more guiding RNAs to the CRISPR mix so that the defense simultaneously recognizes more areas of the virus.  The HIV virus can mutate very quickly,  says Liao.  If we target multiple regions at the same time, we reduce the chance that the virus can develop resistance. ","Published: March 12, 2015"

In a new study, published in Neuron, scientists replaced the normal mouse presenilin-1 gene with Alzheimer s-causing forms of the human gene to discover how these genetic changes may lead to the disorder. Their surprising results may transform the way scientists design drugs that target these mutations to treat inherited or familial Alzheimer s, a rare form of the disease that affects approximately 1 percent of people with the disorder. The study was partially funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health. For decades, it has been unclear exactly how the presenilin mutations cause Alzheimer s disease. Presenilin is a component of an important enzyme, gamma secretase, which cuts up amyloid precursor protein into two protein fragments, Abeta40 and Abeta42. Abeta42 is found in plaques, the abnormal accumulations of protein in the brain which are a hallmark of Alzheimer s. Numerous studies suggested that presenilin-1 mutations increased activity of gamma-secretase. Investigators have developed drugs that block gamma-secretase, but they have so far failed in clinical trials to halt the disease. The study led by Raymond Kelleher, M.D., Ph.D. and Jie Shen, Ph.D., professors of neurology at Harvard Medical School, Boston, provides a plot twist in the association of presenilin-1 mutations and inherited Alzheimer s disease. Using mice with altered forms of the presenilin gene, Drs. Kelleher and Shen discovered that the mutations may cause the disease by decreasing, rather than increasing, the activity of gamma-secretase. One of the presenilin mutations also caused impairment of memory circuits in the mouse brain and age-dependent death of neurons.  The findings by Drs. Shen and Kelleher are a significant departure from conventional thinking that should open up exciting and creative new possibilities at all levels of research, from basic molecular mechanisms all the way to clinical intervention,  said Roderick Corriveau, Ph.D., program director at NINDS.  This is a very striking example where we have mutations that inactivate gamma-secretase function and yet they trigger an array of features that resemble Alzheimer s disease, notably synaptic and cognitive deficits as well as neurodegeneration,  said Dr. Kelleher. Although plaques are the main biological indicator of Alzheimer s, neurodegenerative changes are also an important feature of the disease. These changes include loss of brain cells, cognitive deficits such as problems with memory, changes in the brain s electrical activity and inflammation. Commonly used mouse models of the disease exhibit excessive plaque deposition, but do not show symptoms of neurodegeneration. According to Dr. Kelleher, this may be one reason that treatments developed in mice have not been successful in patients.  This study is the first example of a mouse model in which a familial Alzheimer s mutation is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration. The new model provides an opportunity that we hope will help with the development of therapies focusing on the devastating neurodegenerative changes that occur in the disease,  Dr. Kelleher said. Dr. Shen s previous work demonstrated that presenilins and gamma-secretase play an important role in learning and memory, communication between brain cells and neuronal survival, and cautioned against the use of gamma-secretase inhibitors for Alzheimer s disease therapy. Later, a large phase III trial was stopped because treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor worsened the cognitive ability of patients. Although the majority of cases are not inherited, familial Alzheimer s disease is associated with early onset of the disorder, with symptoms often appearing before age 60. Drs. Shen and Kelleher hope that the mechanisms uncovered in this study may provide insight into the common forms of the disorder that affect more than five million people in the United States. The results in this paper suggest a new approach for drug development.  We believe that restoring gamma-secretase would be a better, more effective therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer s patients,  said Dr. Shen. This work was supported by grants from the NINDS (NS041783, NS042818, NS075346), the Alzheimer s Association, and the Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences.","Published: March 12, 2015"

Patients suffering from depression appear to experience time differently than healthy individuals. Statements made by corresponding patients indicate that for them time seems to pass extremely slowly or even stands still. Psychologists at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU) have collated relevant studies on the subject to analyze them in a so-called meta-study. What they found was that, in comparison with healthy individuals, depressed individuals actually do have a subjective feeling that time is passing more slowly. However, when asked to judge the duration of a specific time interval, such as two seconds or two minutes, their estimates are just as accurate as those of healthy subjects. Sven Th nes and Dr. Daniel Oberfeld-Twistel of the Institute of Psychology at Mainz University looked at the results from 16 individual studies in which 433 depressed subjects and 485 non-depressed control subjects participated. ""Psychiatrists and psychologists in hospitals and private practices repeatedly report that depressed patients feel that time only creeps forward slowly or is passing in slow motion,"" reported Oberfeld-Twistel. ""The results of our analysis confirm that this is indeed the case."" Initial scientific surveys on the subject were performed as early as the 1940s. The earliest study analyzed by the Mainz-based psychologists dates from 1977. In the second part of their meta-analysis, Th nes and Oberfeld-Twistel examined subjective estimates of how long events last. In these studies, the subjects were asked, for example, to estimate the duration of a movie in minutes, press a button for five seconds, or discriminate the duration of two sounds. The results obtained for the depressed subjects were exactly the same as those for the healthy ones without any relevant statistical difference. ""We found strong indicators that in depressed individuals the subjective feeling of the passage of time differs from the ability to assess the actual duration of external events,"" concluded Oberfeld-Twistel, summarizing the findings. Th nes and Oberfeld-Twistel identified several aspects of the relation between depression and time perception that have not yet been investigated adequately. Little is actually known about the effects of antidepressants and psychotherapy, or how patients with bipolar disorders compared to non-bipolar depression assess the passing of time. In the view of the authors of the meta-study, future studies in the field need to clearly differentiate between the subjective perception of the passage of time and the ability to estimate the length of precisely defined time intervals.

Their findings, which appear in the journal Nature Communications, shed new light on the brain processes underpinning judgments we make on a daily basis. ""Categorization is vital for survival, such as distinguishing food from inedible things, as well as for formation of concepts, for instance 'dog vs. cat,' and relationship between concepts, such as hierarchical classification of animals,"" says author Xiao-Jing Wang, Global Professor of Neural Science, Physics, and Mathematics at NYU and NYU Shanghai. ""Our proposed model can only explain category learning of simple visual stimuli. Future research is needed to explore if the general principles extracted from this model are applicable to more complex categorizations."" Wang conducted the study with Tatiana Engel, a postdoctoral associate at the time of the study, and Jah Chaisangmongkon, a doctoral candidate in his group, in collaboration with experimentalist David Freedman, a neurobiologist at the University of Chicago. Freedman had previously developed a behavioral paradigm for investigating electrical activity of single-neurons that are correlated with category memberships of visual stimuli. In this neural-circuit model, which incorporates what we know about the organization and neurophysiology of the cortex, lower-level neural circuits send information about visual stimuli to a higher-level neural circuit where an analog stimulus feature (like the direction of a random pattern of moving dots) is classified into binary categories (A or B). The researchers' results showed that the model captured a wide range of experimental observations and yielded specific predictions that were confirmed by an analysis of single-neuron electrical activity recorded in a category-learning experiment. Interestingly, the researchers found that learning a correct category boundary (dividing the continuous feature into A and B) requires top-down feedback projection from category-selective neurons to feature-coding neurons. Since the pioneering work by NYU's J. Anthony Movshon, Stanford's William Newsome, and others, it has been well known that feature-coding sensory neurons reflect an animal's choice about categorical membership (A or B) of a stimulus in a probabilistic way (quantified as ""choice probability""). The common belief was that this is because a category choice is influenced by stochastic, or random, activity of sensory neurons through bottom-up, sensory-to-category pathways. The new model, reported in the Nature Communications article, suggests a novel interpretation, namely that such ""choice probability"" results from category-to-sensory, top-down signaling. This finding offers new insights into feedback projections in the brain whose functional significance had previously been a long-standing puzzle, the researchers note.

The cell groups here do not seem to be talking to each other, and are less interdependent in their functioning than previously suspected. Their findings were published in Brain Structure and Function. The neostriatum is part of a larger system in the brain that plans and executes voluntary movements. It consists of 'patch' and 'matrix' type neurons that are grouped separately. But these groupings still interweave in a three dimensional labyrinth. The lack of cross-talk between them revealed by this study has implications for studying diseases like Parkinson's, which afflicts the nervous system. In a human Parkinson's patient, the neostriatum is depleted of the messenger chemical dopamine, which helps regulate and strengthen motor responses in the brain. These patients have extraordinary difficulty starting mundane activities like standing or walking. Yet they do rise to the occasion during emergencies, and sometimes even find stairs easier. This is a neuro-scientific puzzle. The OIST researchers who published the findings study Parkinson's in mice. They initially infected all the outputs leaving the neostriatum, with a virus that makes the cells sensitive to light. They expected all the connections to fire and the cells to light up in the neostriatum upon stimulating the brain slices. But to their surprise, some parts didn't. At this point, the experienced eye of the OIST unit's head Prof. Gordon Arbuthnott recognized the distribution of these dark patches as the 'patch' cell compartments he had helped map years earlier. The virus had spared them. This fortuitous finding now allowed the researchers to stimulate the 'patch' and 'matrix' compartments separately. They could find no active connections between the two areas. To find a behavioral link in mice, OIST researchers first trained hungry mice to reach for food pellets, then used the virus to temporarily deactivate all matrix compartments in a sub-part of the neostriatum that had been previously associated with forepaw use. With only 'patch' cells at their disposal the mice failed to grasp the pellets, but kept reaching for them. Consistent failure did not discourage them, as it would healthy mice. While the overall finding confirms older anatomical speculations about the 'patch' and 'matrix' groupings being independent, Prof. Arbuthnott is not entirely convinced. The result opens new avenues for studying the neostriatum. While most research over the past decade has focused on mapping connections leaving it, the OIST result is a gentle nudge in the right direction -- inward, not outward. ""The simplest level of explanation I can think of is that one part makes the value judgment based on previous experience, and the other controls the movement. But is it really true that one part is doing one kind of calculation without consulting the other part? That's the big question for me,"" he said.

The drug appears to enhance an innate cellular mechanism that protects myelin-producing cells against inflammatory stress. These findings point to promising avenues for the development of new therapeutics against MS, report scientists from the University of Chicago in Nature Communications. ""Guanabenz appears to enhance the cell's own protective machinery to diminish the loss of myelin, which is the major hallmark of MS,"" said senior study author Brian Popko, PhD, Jack Miller Professor of Neurological Disorders at the University of Chicago ""While there have been many efforts to stimulate re-myelination, this now represents a unique protective approach. You don't have to repair the myelin if you don't lose it in the first place."" Multiple sclerosis is characterized by an abnormal immune response that leads to inflammation in the brain and the destruction of myelin -- a fatty sheath that protects and insulates nerve fibers. MS is thought to affect more than 2.3 million people worldwide and has no known cure. Popko and his colleagues have previously shown that oligodendrocytes, the brain cells which produce myelin, possess an innate mechanism that responds to stressors such as inflammation. It temporarily shuts down almost all normal protein production in the cell and selectively increases the production of protective proteins. When this mechanism is malfunctioning or overloaded -- by the chronic inflammation seen in MS, for example -- oligodendrocyte death and demyelination is significantly increased. A recent study found evidence that guanabenz, a drug approved for oral administration for hypertension, enhances this stress response pathway independent of its anti-hypertension actions. To test the suitability of guanabenz as a potential treatment for MS, Popko and his team exposed cultured oligodendrocyte cells to interferon gamma -- a molecule that increases inflammation -- resulting in greatly increased myelin loss and cell death. Treating these cells with guanabenz prevented myelin loss and restored cell survival to near normal levels. Oligodendrocytes that were not exposed to interferon gamma were unaffected by guanabenz, suggesting that it enhances only an active stress response pathway. The team then tested the drug on multiple mouse models of MS. When treated with guanabenz, mice that are genetically engineered to express high amounts of interferon gamma in their brains were protected against oligodendrocyte and myelin loss. Treated mice retained several times more myelination and oligodendrocytes than untreated mice. To study a chronic model of MS, the researchers immunized mice with a component of myelin, triggering an immune response against myelin similar to MS in humans. Clinical symptoms developed, but guanabenz administered a week after immunization significantly delayed the onset of these symptoms and reduced peak severity. Treatment also prevented around 20 percent of mice from developing symptoms at all. To study the suitability of guanabenz as a therapeutic after MS symptoms have already appeared and peaked, the researchers used a mouse model in which symptoms relapse and remit -- cycling from high severity to low severity to high again over time. They administered guanabenz immediately after symptoms peaked, and found a nearly 50 percent reduction in severity during the next relapse cycle. ""Human MS predominantly follows a relapsing-remitting pattern,"" said co-author Sharon Way, PhD, a National MS Society Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicago. ""Our hope is that this approach would provide protection against future relapses by making them milder and less frequent."" The team confirmed that guanabenz acts by temporarily blocking the reactivation of a protein known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2 ). When deactivated, eIF2  initiates the stress response pathway. Blocking its reactivation results in a prolonged stress response and provides protection against cell death. The researchers hypothesize that guanabenz stimulates a protective cascade -- because fewer oligodendrocytes die, less immune cells are recruited to the brain, which results in a decreased inflammatory response and preservation of myelin levels. The team notes that eIF2  becomes reactivated after a certain amount of time through pathways that guanabenz does not act upon, so eventually the stress response mechanism will shut down regardless of treatment. However, the protective efficacy of guanabenz and its ability to alleviate relapses, coupled with its established safety profile, makes for promising clinical implications. The Myelin Repair Foundation, which funded this work as part of a multi-institutional effort to accelerate research and development of treatments for MS, has entered into a cooperative agreement with the National Institutes of Health to assess guanabenz as a therapeutic candidate in MS clinical studies. ""Guanabenz will probably not be a standalone drug, but we hope that it can be developed for use in combination with other medications,"" Popko said. ""Some current treatments can have severe side effects -- for example dangerous infections in the brain. It would be of tremendous benefit for patients to have effective, less-risky therapies.

Results of the study by scientists at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health appear in the journal Translational Psychiatry. The researchers found that lead had a detrimental effect on cells in three brain areas implicated in schizophrenia: the medial prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and the striatum of rats exposed to lead before birth and in the early part of their lives. Density of brain cells known as Parvalbumin-Positive GABAergic interneurons, or PVGI, declined by approximately a third--at roughly the same percentage decline seen in schizophrenia patients. And, using imaging technology, they identified higher levels of a dopamine receptor called D2R. Again, the magnitude of the increase matched what has been documented in human schizophrenia patients, and in a previous study of genetically engineered mice. ""The similarities in the brain structure and neuronal systems between what we see in lead-exposed rats and human schizophrenia patients are striking, and adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that early lead exposure primes the brain for schizophrenia later in life,"" says senior author Tom s Guilarte, PhD, chair of Environmental Health Sciences at the Mailman School. In a related finding, the researchers found that rats exposed to lead had a much stronger reaction to cocaine than healthy rat controls. In the experiment, lead-exposed rats that were injected with cocaine ran around in their cages at twice the distance of lead-free control rats. The rat behavior is meaningful because it mirrors what is seen in schizophrenia patients, who are known to have a heightened response to the drug. Schizophrenia is not the only possible consequence of lead exposure. A follow-up experiment will allow the rats to self-administer cocaine in order to test whether lead exposure plays a role in addiction. ""We are currently assessing the impact of lead exposure on both the rewarding and reinforcing properties of addictive drugs like cocaine while exploring the biological underpinnings of how lead exposure plays a role in addiction,"" says first author Kirstie Stansfield, PhD, associate research scientist at the Mailman School.

A team from the Max Planck Institute in Germany has tested this on mice, opening the door to potential new drugs for the cerebrovascular accident. The majority of stroke occurs when the blood vessels that reach the brain are blocked by clots or fatty deposits which decrease the flow of blood towards its cells. It is then that an ischemic attack occurs, a pathology that leads to the degeneration of neurons, which can be fatal and not many drugs can treat. Now, German and Swiss scientists have discovered that the combination of two substances help to reduce inflammation and the brain volume affected after a cerebrovascular accident. This is glucosamine, an amino sugar commonly used to treat arthritis and arthrosis; and certain derivatives of fullerenes, hollow and spherical structures formed by many carbon atoms. Before now it was known that the fullerenes capture chemical radicals well which makes them act as neuroprotective agents, while the glucosamine brings down the inflammation. What the researchers have done is chemically bond the two compounds to produce what is known as 'glyconanoparticles'. These have subsequently been administered to laboratory rats which then had a cerebrovascular accident induced. The results, published in the journal Experimental Neurology, conclude that this combination of fullerene derivatives and glucosamine reduces cell damage and inflammation after a stroke, according to the MRI scans of animal brains and the improvement of their neurological symptoms. ""Our study confirms that it is possible to couple fullerenes with sugars in order to combine their protective effects and in this way, to obtain new materials which may help to prevent and to treat Stroke,"" says Guillermo Orts-Gil, a Spanish researcher at the Max-Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces (Germany) and co-author of the research. ""Although the present study was carried out on mice, the results indicate that these sweet buckyballs are potential new drugs for treating stroke also in humans. However, this must be taken with caution, since what works in mice does not necessarily will work in the same way in humans,"" declared Orts-Gil. This work is the continuation of another previous piece of research, published last year in the journal Nano Letters, in which the researchers also confirmed that a protein called E-selectin, linked to the chain of events that occur during a stroke, is distributed throughout the brain and not only in the area where the stroke originates, as previously thought.

This will be a major step forward as there is nothing on the market that slows the progression of Alzheimer's. Muraleedharan Nair, Michigan State University (MSU) natural products chemist, has patented a botanical compound, withanamides. His spinoff company, Natural Therapeutics, will begin the trials as soon as funding is in place. To date, none of the major pharmaceutical companies -- Merck, Eli Lilly, Bristol-Myers Squibb -- have been able to produce an effective treatment that passed human clinical trials, Nair said. ""This particular research has focused on ashwagandha, an herbal remedy that's been used in Eastern medicines for centuries,"" he said. ""Our compound withanamides may work to prevent Alzheimer's disease at the onset, and it also could prevent its progression."" While plants cannot be patented, compounds from it can. MSU holds the patent for withanamides, and earlier research revealed that the compound, found in the plants' seeds, proved to be a powerful anti-oxidant -- double the strength of what's on today's market. The potent compound has shown that it can protect cells against damaging attacks by a rogue protein -- the earliest stage of Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's begins when a specific protein starts cleaving at the wrong place to produce an unwanted fragment. This bad fragment, called BAP, stresses cells' membranes, sparks plaque formation and eventually kills the cells. This attack begins in the frontal lobe, erasing memories and continuing its unrelenting assault deeper into the brain. A complicating factor is that the majority of protein cleaving is a natural, healthy process. Pharmaceutical companies, however, have focused their efforts on blocking the tiny faction of bad cleaving of the protein producing BAP. ""Rather than trying to stop only the malevolent cleaving, our compound keeps the bad protein from entering the cell where it does its damage,"" he said. ""Our studies have shown that withanamides effectively protect the brain cells by neutralizing the effect of BAP."" Nair, who holds nearly 90 U.S. and international patents, is using withanamides to interrupt the action of BAP, hence preventing Alzheimer's at an early stage. Nair and his collaborators published in Phytotherapy Research that withanamides protected mouse brain cells from BAP damage. A recent study, also published in Phytotherapy Research and using mouse models, showed that withanamides passed the blood brain barrier, the filter that controls what chemicals reach the brain. The results showed that the compound reached its intended target, passing the last test before advancing to human testing. After the clinical trials, which could be conducted as quick as six to twelve months, Nair and Natural Therapeutics will pursue U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. ""Dr. Nair discovered his molecule in a food-safe plant,"" said Jim Richter, Natural Therapeutics President. ""It's also classified as GRAS -- generally regarded as safe -- by the FDA. This means that we can bypass many of the hurdles that slow synthetic molecules that need testing. By compressing the timeline dramatically, we'll be able to save tens of millions of dollars, and if successful, bring an effective treatment to Alzheimer's patients.""

Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed.  The work will focus on supporting the validation of a Cancer Research UK SMP Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) targeted enrichment panel, using Horizon s HDx human genomic Reference Materials. The NGS project involves multi-gene, multi-aberration tumor analysis and is being run in CPA, GLP and ISO accredited laboratories, with a UK NEQAS (www.ukneqas.org.uk) quality assessment. These Reference Materials will support run-to-run and lab-to-lab longitudinal assessment of performance of the NGS technology.   In Phase Two of the SMP, Cancer Research UK will work with the national Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre (ECMC) network and national genetic testing laboratories to develop a national screening programme for lung cancer samples in the NHS. Once screened, these results will be used to place patients on the National Lung Matrix Trial, run by the Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit (CRCTU) in Birmingham, and led by Prof. Gary Middleton.   The scope of the project involves Horizon s Diagnostics business unit providing renewable, genetically defined Reference Materials representing a range of genetic aberrations and containing defined allelic mutation frequencies. The Reference Materials developed will enable reliable comparison of assay performance across sequencing platforms, targeted assays and laboratories by providing a common universal reference point. Many factors contribute to variability in the quality of clinical samples, which is currently a concern within molecular pathology laboratories working towards the clinical application of NGS panels for tumor screening. To address this, Cancer Research UK will use Horizon s precisely defined formalin compromised Reference Standards to assess the performance of Cancer Research UK s-SMP NGS, in order to inform any necessary changes in clinical practice surrounding preparation of FFPE samples for downstream NGS analysis.  Dr Paul Morrill, President, Products, Horizon Discovery, said:  Research programs such as Cancer Research UK s Stratified Medicine Programme form a vital piece of the puzzle in the drive toward personalized, or stratified, medicine as a routine approach for the testing and treatment of cancer. We are delighted to have been chosen to support Cancer Research UK on the delivery of Phase Two of this project.  Dr Ian Walker, Head of Cancer Research UK s stratified medicine programme, commented:  Research into stratified medicine is helping us to understand the genetic changes that drive cancer, and to find out how different cancers respond to treatment. Ensuring accuracy in genetic assessment of tumors is a vital part of this process, and we welcome Horizon s involvement in assisting Cancer Research UK with taking the Stratified Medicine Programme forwards.

The treatment has been developed by Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, with early development work carried out using MRC Technology s antibody humanization expertise. Pembrolizumab is considered a next generation drug in cancer care, stimulating the body s immune system to fight the disease. The therapeutic is one of a new generation of PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) therapies that block the biological pathways cancers use to disguise themselves from the immune system. It acts by making the cancer cell  visible  to the immune system and the cell can thus be destroyed by the body s natural defence mechanisms. UK based scientists at MRCT, with extensive expertise in antibody engineering techniques, first advanced the antibody-based treatment and carried out humanization, an essential step in the success of the therapeutic.  EAMS is a new NHS system enabling drugs to be fast-tracked to patients. The scheme has been set up to give severely ill patients rapid access to promising unlicensed medicines, meaning that this drug is available to be prescribed to patients much earlier than it would normally have been before EAMS was established. Dave Tapolczay, Chief Executive Officer, MRC Technology said:  We are very proud of our role in bringing this new cancer treatment to patients with highly invasive tumours. Making pembrolizumab available under the Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS) is another big step in getting healthcare innovation to patients sooner and underlines our commitment to improving lives through science.  Dr Justin Bryans, Director of Drug Discovery, MRC Technology said:  Pembrolizumab is different from other cancer drugs, as it boosts the immune system to launch an attack on cancer cells, rather than destroying cancer cells directly. MRC Technology scientists humanised the antibody so it would not be recognised and hence destroyed by the immune system. The PD-1 pathway allows cancer cells to escape detection by the body s immune response. The antibody blocks this pathway leaving cancer cells susceptible to attack and destruction by the immune system.  MRC Technology has humanized over 55 antibodies to date, including four marketed products, Tysabri (natalizumab), Actemra (tocilizumab), Entyvio (vedolizumab) and Keytruda (pembrolizumab). A further five are in clinical trials and two more in preclinical studies.  Pembrolizumab received FDA (USA) approval in September 2014 and is commercially available in the United States as Keytruda.

Researchers from Emory and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have now obtained a first look at the immune responses in four Ebola virus disease survivors who received care at Emory University Hospital in 2014, by closely examining their T cells and B cells during the acute phase of the disease. The findings reveal surprisingly high levels of immune activation, and have implications for the current effort to develop vaccines against Ebola. All four patients' immune systems showed strong signs of T and B cell activation, according to a paper published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Some previous research on Ebola virus disease had suggested that immune responses could be impaired. ""Our findings counter the idea that Ebola virus infection is immunosuppressive, at least in the patients that we were able to study,"" says lead author Anita McElroy, MD, assistant professor of pediatrics (infectious disease) at Emory University School of Medicine and a guest researcher at CDC's Viral Special Pathogens Branch. ""They also demonstrate the value that supportive care may have in enabling the immune system to fight back against Ebola virus infection."" The paper emerged from a collaboration between immunologists at Emory Vaccine Center led by Rafi Ahmed, PhD, Aneesh Mehta, MD and Emory's Serious Communicable Diseases Unit team, and investigators from CDC's Viral Special Pathogens Branch, led by Christina Spiropoulou, PhD. Researchers from La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology contributed to the paper. ""Until now, detailed studies like this in acute Ebola virus disease were logistically challenging,"" Ahmed says. ""Our work only became possible through a close collaboration with the CDC and use of its biosafety level 4 facilities."" Each patient's level of immune activation reflected the relative intensity of their illnesses. ""All four patients have been enthusiastic about participating in research to further knowledge about Ebola,"" Mehta says. ""They have voluntarily donated blood on multiple occasions as part of this research study."" Out of the four patients, the first two became very sick, the third was even sicker and required renal replacement therapy and respiratory support, and the fourth had a milder illness in comparison. While hospitalized, the first three of the patients displayed lymphopenia, or low levels of immune cells in their blood. However, an extraordinarily high proportion of their B and T cells were activated, researchers found. The immune activation continued even after the virus became undetectable in the blood and patients had left the hospital, suggesting that Ebola antigens persist in the body for several weeks. Scientists tracked patients' B cells, important for generating antibodies against the Ebola virus, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which directly kill infected cells. The patients' CD8+ T cells targeted several proteins, and a major target was an internal Ebola virus protein called NP. However, vaccines now entering clinical trials in Africa contain only the external glycoprotein called GP. This suggests that NP could be added to existing vaccines to generate stronger T cell responses. ""CD8+ T cell responses have been associated with vaccine protection against Ebola infection in some animal models,"" McElroy says. ""But the relative importance of T cell responses, compared to antibody responses, in driving survival and vaccine efficacy in humans is not known. We anticipate it will be an active area of research in the future.""","Published: March 11, 2015"

The test could avert disasters like the 2006 trial of the drug TGN1412, which led to six healthy young men being admitted to intensive care with multiple organ failure. The volunteers receiving TGN1412 experienced a catastrophic inflammatory reaction called a cytokine storm. Cytokine storm reactions are a particular worry for new biological therapies, or ""biologics"", which use biological material such as antibodies. Many blockbuster drugs such as the cancer drugs Herceptin and Avastin are biologics, as are around a third of medicines in the pharmaceutical pipeline. Because these medicines are specific to humans, they can cause severe reactions that don't materialize in animal studies, so tests on human cells are essential. However, cytokine storm side effects are hard to predict with tests were just one cell type is used, since they depend on interactions between blood cells and endothelial cells, which form the lining of blood vessels. But because endothelial cells are deep within the body, they are normally only grown from tissue removed in surgery or post mortem, or from umbilical vessels after birth. Because of this, current tests use endothelial cells taken from vessels of one donor, and white blood cells from a different donor. When cells from two different donors are used, one may have an immune reaction to the other, meaning the system is already primed for inflammation before the drug is added. This can result in the test falsely showing a severe immune reaction to a drug that is safe. Researchers at Imperial College London got around this problem by isolating stem cells from the blood of a volunteer, and using them to grow endothelial cells in a dish. They then took white blood cells which they added to the donor's own endothelial cells to recreate the unique conditions found in their blood vessels. When TGN1412 was added to the test tube, the mixture of cells released a cytokine storm, as would happen inside the body. The new method is better as it only requires blood from one donor and doesn't mix cells from different people, with the advantage of making a more reliable test. Professor Jane Mitchell, from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London, who led the study, said: ""As biological therapies become more mainstream, it's more likely that drugs being tested on humans for the first time will have unexpected and potentially catastrophic effects. We've used adult stem cell technology to develop a laboratory test that could prevent another disaster like the TGN1412 trial. ""Drug companies have the technical capacity to start using this test now, but we're working on developing an off-the-shelf kit which will make it easy to use on a large scale."" Dr Daniel Reed, the first author on the study, said: ""A further benefit of this new technology is that personalized therapies can be tested to see how safe and effective they will be for an individual."" The Imperial researchers have collaborated with the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control to validate the test and are now working with the clinical trials company Quintiles to develop the technology further. The research is published in the FASEB Journal.","Published: March 11, 2015"

The test could be done in community pediatric settings. The degree of accuracy, they said, out performs other behavioral and genetic screens for infants and toddlers with ASD described in literature. The causes of ASD are complex and diverse, making it difficult to conclusively diagnose the disease much before a child s fourth year of life. Indeed, the median age of diagnosis in the United States is 53 months.  A major challenge is the difficulty of accurately diagnosing ASD, which is very heterogeneous, at an early enough age to implement the most effective treatment,  said principal investigator Eric Courchesne, PhD, professor of neurosciences and director of the Autism Center of Excellence at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. In the proof-of-principle study, Courchesne, first author Tiziano Pramparo, PhD, and colleagues identified blood-based genomic biomarkers that differentiated toddlers with ASD, ranging in age from one to four years old, from a control group of toddlers without ASD.  Blood samples were taken at the child s initial clinical intake. Importantly, the control group consisted of a mix of young boys commonly seen in community clinics, with typical development, mild language delay, transient language delay and global developmental delay. Against this control group, the researchers identified a genetic signature that identified 83 percent of ASD toddlers. The study used an unbiased systems biology-based method to search for genes and gene pathways in blood samples that best distinguished ASD infants and toddlers from typically developing toddlers and toddlers with non-autism developmental delays. Specifically, the researchers measured leukocyte (white blood cell) RNA expression levels.  Ideally, biomarkers come from tissue affected, but in ASD this is the brain, which is obviously an inaccessible tissue,  said Courchesne.  Peripheral blood of living ASD infants and toddlers is an important alternative, and obtaining blood samples is routine and safe and, thus, is a preferable and accessible tissue for identifying signatures of ASD that could be used in clinical screening and follow-up evaluations.  Pramparo, an associate research scientist at the UC San Diego Autism Center of Excellence, said blood is expected to carry autism-relevant molecular signatures that can be used to detect the disorder at very young ages. It might also reflect aspects of the disrupted biology underlying neural defects. In fact, the researchers found gene expression differences between ASD and non-ASD in genes related to translation and immune/inflammation functions, as well as cell adhesion and cell cycle. These  ASD signature classifier  genes are among those that can have effect on early brain development.  New studies point to autism beginning in the womb,  said Courchesne, who, with colleagues, published one such widely reported study last year detailing disrupted brain development in post-mortem brains of autistic children.  Our present study shows examination of the gene expression profiles at the very early age of initial clinical detection reveals both strong evidence of early biological processes in ASD and abnormal signals with the potential to serve as an early, practical biomarker of risk for the disorder in general pediatric settings.  The scientific team conducted two different analyses of blood samples involving two cohorts of study participants: 147 toddlers (91 with ASD, 56 control) in the first group, 73 toddlers (44 ASD, 29 control) in the second group. The first assay identified an ASD genomic signature 83 percent of the time; the second had a 75 percent accuracy rate. Young male toddlers with autism were the focus of the study because autism is far more prevalent in males.  The genetics and molecular bases of autism may differ somewhat in affected males and females,  said Pramparo.  We reasoned, therefore, that different signatures might need to be discovered and developed in each gender in ASD.  It was simpler to begin with boys.  Autism is four times more common in males,  said Courchesne,  and so we were able to more quickly recruit and test samples of autism males than autism females. Our current work is aimed at recruiting sufficiently large samples of females to begin work to discover possible gene expression markers for them.  Courchesne emphasized that this was a first step toward a possible means of diagnosing autism much earlier than current methodologies, one that would greatly boost the efficacy of intervention and remedial treatments. Though only proof-of-principle, Courchesne said the findings are encouraging. Next steps involve further refinement of the process and identification of diagnostic risk markers for females.  As we write in the paper, our study showed that a blood-based clinical test for at-risk male infants and toddlers could be refined and routinely implemented in pediatric diagnostic settings.

Under the terms of the companies' co-development and commercialization agreement, the achievement of this milestone triggers a payment of US $ 5 million by MorphoSys to Emergent. MOR209/ES414 is an immunotherapeutic protein developed by Emergent using its proprietary ADAPTIR  (modular protein technology) platform. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies have shown MOR209/ES414 redirects T-cell cytotoxicity towards cells expressing prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), an antigen commonly found on prostate cancer cells. Arndt Schottelius, Chief Development Officer of MorphoSys, said: ""MOR209/ES414 has the potential to address a clear unmet medical need in prostate cancer. We are thus delighted to see this compound moving into the clinic as expected in early 2015. This is the fourth clinical candidate in our growing proprietary portfolio of compounds and increases the total number of clinical programs in our pipeline to 23."" Barry Labinger, Executive Vice President and President Biosciences Division at Emergent BioSolutions added: ""Emergent is pleased to announce the dosing of our first patient in this Phase 1 clinical study. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, and there is a significant need for improved treatment options. We believe that the immunotherapeutic approach represented by MOR209/ES414 offers the promise of meaningfully improved outcomes for patients with mCRPC. We are excited to work with our partner MorphoSys, to evaluate the potential of MOR209/ES414 in the clinic."" The study will be conducted in two stages. The primary objective of stage 1 is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MOR209/ES414 administered intravenously, with weekly dosing for three months and bi-weekly thereafter, to patients with mCRPC. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), immunogenicity, cytokine response, and clinical activity of MOR209/ES414. Within stage 2, the primary objective is to evaluate clinical activity in patients that have or have not received prior chemotherapy, while secondary objectives are to further characterize the safety profile, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of MOR209/ES414. This open-label phase 1 clinical study will be conducted in the U.S. and Australia, with a planned enrollment of up to 130 patients.","Published: March 11, 2015"

Now, a study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison shows that while cats ignore our music, they are highly responsive to  music  written especially for them. The study is online at Applied Animal Behaviour Science.  We are not actually replicating cat sounds,  says lead author Charles Snowdon, an emeritus professor of psychology.  We are trying to create music with a pitch and tempo that appeals to cats.  The first step in making cat music is  to evaluate music in the context of the animal s sensory system,  he says. Cats, for example, vocalize one octave higher than people,  So it s vital to get the pitch right. Then we tried to create music that would have a tempo that was appealing to cats.  One sample was based on the tempo of purring, the other on the sucking sound made during nursing. In the tests, Snowdon and former UW undergraduate student (now a Ph.D. student at Binghamton University) Megan Savage brought a laptop and two speakers to the homes of 47 cats and played four sound samples: two from classical music, and two  cat songs  created by University of Maryland composer David Teie. The music began after a period of silence, and the cat s behavior was noted. Purring, walking toward the speaker and rubbing against it were adjudged positive response, while hissing, arching the back and erecting the fur were negative. The cats were significantly more positive toward cat music than classical music. They began the positive response after an average of 110 seconds, compared to 171 seconds for the human music. The slow responses reflected the situation, Snowdon says.  Some of them needed to wake up and pay attention to what was going on, and some were out of the room when we set up.  The cats showed almost the same number of aversive responses to each type of music. The study follows a 2009 report by Snowdon and Teie, which showed that a monkey called the cotton-top tamarin responded emotionally to music composed specifically for them. That work led Snowdon and Teie to believe that  the same features that are effective in inducing and communicating emotional states in human music might also apply to other species.  These features include pitch, tempo and timbre. Studies of animals and human music have produced conflicting results, and one influential study supposedly proved that animals do not appreciate music. Snowdon says the field has labored under mistaken premises. One is the frequency problem: Animals hear different ranges than we do. Researchers who played Mozart to rats in Japan proved that the animals were ignoring frequencies below 4,000 hertz, meaning that most human music is irrelevant to them. The second misconception is that all classical music will be calming, when it may in fact be invigorating, angry or ominous. Combined, these factors may eliminate any chance that the animals would respond as expected to the  music  under study.  The problem is a bit of both,  says Snowdon.  They don t hear it, and it s not music to them.  With more people trying to  enrich  the lives of animals by playing music to them, Snowdon hopes the more sophisticated approach he and his colleagues take will help put some facts on the table.  A reporter for National Public Radio is convinced his dog likes classical, so he puts on NPR all day,  he says.  A guy from a rock station thought his dog liked heavy metal, so he put that on all day. There is a lot of silly stuff going on. We don t yet know, for most cases, what the effects of music are on animals.  University of Wisconsin - Madison   Original reporting by: David Tenenbaum Charles T.

New research from The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) shows that two proteins critical for maintaining healthy day-night cycles also protect against mutations that could lead to cancer. The new study, published in the journal eLife, shows that the two proteins have an unexpected role in DNA repair, possibly protecting cells from cancer-causing mutations triggered by UV radiation.  These proteins play an important role in the response to DNA damage,  said TSRI biologist Katja Lamia, senior author of the study.  Researchers might eventually harness that knowledge for pharmaceutical targeting.  The human body senses light and adjusts its rhythms to a day-night cycle called the circadian clock. Feeling tired? Feeling hungry? These feelings are strongly influenced by the body s circadian clock.  Studies show that people with unusual sleep schedules, such as flight attendants or night-shift nurses, are at risk for certain health problems.  When you have a deregulation of your circadian clock, you re more prone to develop some kind of pathology, like diabetes, cancer or heart disease,  said TSRI Research Associate Anne-Laure Huber, who was co-first author of the study with Stephanie Papp, a graduate student at TSRI. In the new study, the research team investigated a possible cause of these health disparities. They focused on the role of proteins called cryptochromes, which are believed to have evolved from light-activated DNA repair enzymes in bacteria. Cryptochromes contain a photo-responsive pigment called flavin. While cryptochromes are no longer light-activated, they do hold to a daytime-regulated schedule, and stability of the proteins cryptochrome 1 (Cry1) and cryptochrome 2 (Cry2) is critical for circadian clock function. In the human body, cryptochromes no longer have a direct role in DNA repair either, but they are essential for regulating blood sugar levels and protein production on a day-night cycle. The new study started when the researchers went on what Lamia calls a  fishing expedition.  They used a technique called proteomic  screening, in collaboration with the laboratory of TSRI Professor John Yates, to test for a wide range of proteins that could bind to Cry1 or Cry2 from mouse and human cells.  The team found that Cry1 could bind with Hausp, a protein with a known role in regulating an anti-cancer protein called p53. The screening also showed that Hausp binds to Cry2, but not as strongly, suggesting that the nearly identical proteins actually have different roles related to DNA repair.  Most of the time people study them as redundant proteins, but we show that they have distinct functions in this DNA-repair pathway,  said Lamia. Subsequent studies of genetic expression showed that Hausp stabilizes Cry1 by removing protein chains that trigger Cry1 degradation. By stabilizing Cry1, Hausp prevents potential errors in DNA transcription that could occur when DNA is exposed to radiation.  This is very cool,  said Papp.  These proteins can sense that something is wrong in the cells.  The researchers also found that when they blocked Cry2 production in cells, the cells no longer activated p21, a protein that stops mutant cells from dividing.  This could suggest that cells without Cry2 would be more susceptible to cancer,  said Lamia. Together, these findings show that while Cry1 and Cry2 no longer directly repair DNA, they still have an indirect role in the repair process.  This new link between circadian clock proteins and DNA repair is a clue to how disrupting day-night cycles could harm health. Lamia said future studies in her lab will explore additional roles of cryptochromes in the body.

The markers are associated with gene networks that regulate innate immune function and interferon signaling. The findings, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, offer novel insights into the pathophysiology of PTSD. In clinical terms, researchers say they could lead to new ways to not just improve diagnosis and treatment of persons with the mental health condition, but predict who might be more susceptible. Previous genomic studies of PTSD have focused upon identifying differences in gene expression between persons with PTSD relative to a control group. The new study takes a broader  systems-level approach,  using whole transcriptome RNA sequencing, said first author Michael S. Breen, PhD, at the University of Southampton in England.  By comparing U.S. Marines who develop PTSD symptoms to those who do not, we can measure differences in genes, but also take into consideration the dynamic relationships between and among them, their connectivity,  Breen said.  Because PTSD is thought to be such a complex disorder, measuring these dynamic relationships is crucial to better understanding the PTSD pathology.  The researchers analyzed blood samples from 188 U.S. Marines, taken before and after deployment to conflict zones. They identified modules of co-regulated genes involved in innate immune response   the body s first line of defense against pathogens   and interferon signaling, that were also associated with PTSD. Interferons are proteins released by host cells in response to the presence of pathogens and in this study are also shown to partake in the pathology PTSD. The results were replicated with a second, completely independent group of 96 U.S. Marines.  What s interesting is that molecular signatures of innate immunity and interferon signaling were identified both after developing PTSD as well as before developing PTSD,  said Dewleen G. Baker, MD, MRS-II principal investigator, research director at the VA Center of Excellence for Stress and Mental Health, and professor in the Department of Psychiatry at UC San Diego. The work, a sub-study of MRS-II, was co-led by Caroline M. Nievergelt, PhD, associate chief of the Neuroscience Unit at the VA Center of Excellence for Stress and Mental Health and assistant adjunct professor in the Department of Psychiatry at UC San Diego and the late Daniel T. O Connor MD, departments of Medicine and Pharmacology at UC San Diego.  The question to ask is what s stimulating an interferon response prior to PTSD development,  said Baker.  The answer could be any number of factors, ranging from a simple explanation of increased anticipatory stress prior to deployment or more complex scenarios where individuals may have a higher viral load. It s a question for future studies.  Experts say what makes PTSD different   and more challenging to study   than other psychiatric disorders is the presence or trigger of a traumatic event, such as serving in a combat zone.  The odds of obtaining a sample both before and after a traumatic event are incredibly small,  said co-senior author Christopher H. Woelk, PhD, reader in genomics and bioinformatics at University of Southampton and assistant adjunct professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine.  Under this experimental design, not only can we identify differences between U.S. Marines with PTSD and without, but we can go back in time, so to speak, to see if any of the Marines who eventually developed PTSD contain prognostic signatures that might be indicative of eventual PTSD emergence. In this vein, we are able to start labeling findings as being putatively  causal  in nature.  Woelk said the findings are intriguing because they follow upon recent studies that have demonstrated how changes in peripheral blood might lay the seeds for subsequent pathological changes in the brain.  Since our causal (pre-deployment) and consequential (post-deployment) discoveries are based upon peripheral blood samples, these results suggest that identifying individuals at risk for PTSD development may be achievable through high-throughput profiling of molecular data.  The researchers say their results should encourage further investigation along two distinct avenues. First, development of a blood panel of predictive biomarkers to identify persons at greater risk of developing PTSD. Second, use of molecular information from blood samples to design targeted therapies to treat   or help prevent   PTSD.

Researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) s Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI) have demonstrated the power of a new ally in this effort   proteomics! In a study led by Benjamin Schwessinger, a grass geneticist with JBEI s Feedstocks Division, researchers used advanced proteomic techniques to identify 1,750 unique proteins in shoots of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a North American native prairie grass that is widely viewed as one of the most promising of all the fuel crop candidates.  This was a pilot study to actually test if these proteomic tools are applicable to switchgrass,  Schwessinger says.  That we were able to identify such a large number of proteins in our samples shows that proteomics will be useful when we start digging for proteins that will enable us to manipulate switchgrass for increased biofuel production.  The results of this study are reported in the journal Proteomics. The paper is titled  Proteome profile of the endomembrane of developing coleoptiles from switchgrass (Panicum virgatum).

(Photo by Roy Kaltschmidt) The burning of fossil fuels is responsible for the release of nearly 9 billion metric tons of excess carbon into the atmosphere each year. Fuels made from the sugars in plants and other forms of biomass would provide a clean, green and renewable alternative if the production of biofuels is cost-effective. This will require, among other developments, plants whose sugars are more readily extracted and fermented into fuels by microbes.  Plant cell walls or biomass are costly to deconstruct for sugar release for downstream applications such as biofuels, but genetic modifications to plant cell wall structure could result in significant downstream economic impacts,  Schwessinger says. To this end, Schwessinger and his colleagues carried out the first proteomic analysis of switchgrass material, profiling the proteome of the switchgrass endomembrane from 10-day old dark grown shoots.  The overall number of unique proteins we identified highlights the contributions proteomics can provide as more plant genomes become publicly accessible,  Schwessinger says.  You can think of it as a tool that helps us find needles in a haystack. For example, with proteomics we can determine the four highest expressed members out of a protein family of 60.

She said:  One theory that is used to explain high levels of drug use is that people use cannabis to self-medicate their symptoms of bipolar disorder.   The study looked at people diagnosed with bipolar disorder but who were not experiencing a depressive or manic episode during the six days the research was carried out. Each participant completed a paper diary about their emotional state and drug use at several random points daily over a period of week.  This enabled people to log their daily experiences in the moment before they forgot how they were feeling. An individual with experience of bipolar disorder and cannabis use commented:  I do smoke a small amount to lift my mood and make myself slightly manic but it also lifts my mood and switches me into a different mind-set .  I do not use weed to manage depression as it can make it worse, making me anxious and paranoid .  I have found though that if I have smoked more excessively it can make me feel depressed for days afterwards . The study found that the odds of using cannabis increased when individuals were in a good mood. Cannabis use was also associated with an increase in positive mood, manic symptoms and paradoxically an increase in depressive symptoms, but not in the same individuals. Dr Tyler said:  The findings suggest that cannabis is not being used to self-medicate small changes in symptoms within the context of daily life. However, cannabis use itself may be associated with both positive and negative emotional states. We need to find out whether these relationships play out in the longer term as this may have an impact on a person s course of bipolar disorder.

Researchers at Vanderbilt University and the Shanghai Cancer Institute examined the association of nut consumption with mortality among low-income and racially diverse populations and found that intake of peanuts was associated with fewer deaths, especially from heart disease. The study was published March 2 in JAMA Internal Medicine. The first author of the paper is Hung Luu, Ph.D., a post-doctoral fellow in the Division of Epidemiology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Senior author is Xiao-Ou Shu, M.D., Ph.D., associate director for Global Health at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center and professor of Medicine in the Department of Epidemiology.  Nuts are rich in nutrients, such as unsaturated fatty acids, fiber, vitamins, phenolic antioxidants, arginine and other phytochemicals. All of them are known to be beneficial to cardiovascular health, probably through their anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and endothelial function maintenance properties,  Shu said. While research has previously linked nut consumption with lower mortality, those studies focused mainly on higher-income, white populations. This study was the first to discover that all races - blacks, whites and Asians alike - could potentially increase heart health by eating nuts and peanuts.  In our study, we found that peanut consumption was associated with reduced total mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality in a predominantly low-income black and white population in the U.S., and among Chinese men and women living in Shanghai,  Shu said. This study was based on three large ongoing cohort studies. Participants included more than 70,000 Americans of African and European descent from the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS), who were mostly low-income, and more than 130,000 Chinese from the Shanghai Women s Health Study (SWHS) and the Shanghai Men s Health Study (SMHS). Information on nut consumption was collected by structured questionnaires at the baseline survey. For participants in the SCCS, deaths were determined by linking with the National Death Index and Social Security Administration mortality files, and for participants in the SWHS/SMHS, by linking with the Shanghai Vital Statistics Registry and by conducting home visits. In total, more than 14,000 deaths were identified, with a median follow-up of 5.4 years in the SCCS, 6.5 years in the SMHS, and 12.2 years in the SWHS. Peanut consumption was associated with decreased total mortality, particularly cardiovascular mortality (i.e., 17-21 percent reduction in total mortality, and 23-38 percent reduction in cardiovascular mortality for the highest quartile intake group compared to the lowest quartile group) across all three racial/ethnic groups, among both men and women, and among individuals from low-SES groups. Because peanuts are much less expensive than tree nuts, as well as more widely available to people of all races and all socioeconomic backgrounds, increasing peanut consumption may provide a potentially cost-efficient approach to improving cardiovascular health, Shu said.  The data arise from observational epidemiologic studies, and not randomized clinical trials, and thus we cannot be sure that peanuts per se were responsible for the reduced mortality observed,  said William Blot, Ph.D., associate director for Cancer Prevention, Control and Population-based Research at VICC and a co-author of the study. He did note that  the findings from this new study, however, reinforce earlier research suggesting health benefits from eating nuts, and thus are quite encouraging.  The American Heart Association recommends eating four servings of unsalted, unoiled nuts a week. However, nutrient-rich nuts are also high in calories, so don t eat too many if you re watching weight. A serving size is a small handful or 1.5 ounces of whole nuts or 2 tablespoons of nut butter.","Published: March 10, 2015"

The test could be done in community pediatric settings. The degree of accuracy, they said, out performs other behavioral and genetic screens for infants and toddlers with ASD described in literature. The causes of ASD are complex and diverse, making it difficult to conclusively diagnose the disease much before a child's fourth year of life. Indeed, the median age of diagnosis in the United States is 53 months. ""A major challenge is the difficulty of accurately diagnosing ASD, which is very heterogeneous, at an early enough age to implement the most effective treatment,"" said principal investigator Eric Courchesne, PhD, professor of neurosciences and director of the Autism Center of Excellence at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. In the proof-of-principle study, Courchesne, first author Tiziano Pramparo, PhD, and colleagues identified blood-based genomic biomarkers that differentiated toddlers with ASD, ranging in age from one to four years old, from a control group of toddlers without ASD. Blood samples were taken at the child's initial clinical intake. Importantly, the control group consisted of a mix of young boys commonly seen in community clinics, with typical development, mild language delay, transient language delay and global developmental delay. Against this control group, the researchers identified a genetic signature that identified 83 percent of ASD toddlers. The study used an unbiased systems biology-based method to search for genes and gene pathways in blood samples that best distinguished ASD infants and toddlers from typically developing toddlers and toddlers with non-autism developmental delays. Specifically, the researchers measured leukocyte (white blood cell) RNA expression levels. ""Ideally, biomarkers come from tissue affected, but in ASD this is the brain, which is obviously an inaccessible tissue,"" said Courchesne. ""Peripheral blood of living ASD infants and toddlers is an important alternative, and obtaining blood samples is routine and safe and, thus, is a preferable and accessible tissue for identifying signatures of ASD that could be used in clinical screening and follow-up evaluations."" Pramparo, an associate research scientist at the UC San Diego Autism Center of Excellence, said blood is expected to carry autism-relevant molecular signatures that can be used to detect the disorder at very young ages. It might also reflect aspects of the disrupted biology underlying neural defects. In fact, the researchers found gene expression differences between ASD and non-ASD in genes related to translation and immune/inflammation functions, as well as cell adhesion and cell cycle. These ""ASD signature classifier"" genes are among those that can have effect on early brain development. ""New studies point to autism beginning in the womb,"" said Courchesne, who, with colleagues, published one such widely reported study last year detailing disrupted brain development in post-mortem brains of autistic children. ""Our present study shows examination of the gene expression profiles at the very early age of initial clinical detection reveals both strong evidence of early biological processes in ASD and abnormal signals with the potential to serve as an early, practical biomarker of risk for the disorder in general pediatric settings."" The scientific team conducted two different analyses of blood samples involving two cohorts of study participants: 147 toddlers (91 with ASD, 56 control) in the first group, 73 toddlers (44 ASD, 29 control) in the second group. The first assay identified an ASD genomic signature 83 percent of the time; the second had a 75 percent accuracy rate. Young male toddlers with autism were the focus of the study because autism is far more prevalent in males. ""The genetics and molecular bases of autism may differ somewhat in affected males and females,"" said Pramparo. ""We reasoned, therefore, that different signatures might need to be discovered and developed in each gender in ASD."" It was simpler to begin with boys. ""Autism is four times more common in males,"" said Courchesne, ""and so we were able to more quickly recruit and test samples of autism males than autism females. Our current work is aimed at recruiting sufficiently large samples of females to begin work to discover possible gene expression markers for them."" Courchesne emphasized that this was a first step toward a possible means of diagnosing autism much earlier than current methodologies, one that would greatly boost the efficacy of intervention and remedial treatments. Though only proof-of-principle, Courchesne said the findings are encouraging. Next steps involve further refinement of the process and identification of diagnostic risk markers for females. ""As we write in the paper, our study showed that a blood-based clinical test for at-risk male infants and toddlers could be refined and routinely implemented in pediatric diagnostic settings.""

The study, published in Nature Neuroscience, has applications to understanding the root cause of epileptic seizures, which are frequently centered in the olfactory cortex, the part of the brain that processes the sense of smell.  Our sense of smell is complex and involves many overlapping and interconnected neuronal circuits,  said lead author James Sturgill, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher with the Center for Neural Circuits and Behavior in the Department of Neuroscience.  More than hearing or sight, olfaction is based upon past experiences and associations.   Our research addresses the question of how the brain combines activity from these other circuits with chemosensory inputs to encode an olfactory memory,  he said.  Our results suggest that certain neurons in the olfactory cortex serve as tuners and volume controls for various neuronal inputs.  The cells that appear to perform this task are among the 10 percent of neurons in the brain that secrete inhibitory neurotransmitters, chemicals released in the synapse that raise the threshold for neuronal firing. The function of these inhibitory neurons is increasingly recognized as critical to the sensory perceptions of sound and sight. The study is among the first to demonstrate that inhibitory neurons also play a critical role in processing smells. For the study, neuroscientists employed optogenetics to de-activate inhibitory neurons in the olfactory cortex of mice. The mice were then presented with different odors and intensities of odors, including lemon, pine and banana, while electrical activity in the olfactory cortex was recorded. In the absence of the inhibitory neurons, researchers observed an increase in brain activity unrelated to direct processing of the odors. The amount of this background brain activity was unrelated to odor intensity. When these same neurons were allowed to function normally, the background  noisy  brain activity decreased without distorting the fidelity of the neuronal representation of the odor itself. Described in signal processing terms, the inhibitory neurons appear to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of brain activity. They may also improve the ability to discern different odors.  If you wonder how it is possible to smell a banana peel in a garbage can, it is because of this type of subtle neuronal control, achieved through inhibition,  said senior author Jeffry Isaacson, PhD, professor of neuroscience. Neuronal inhibition by these same cells may also assist in preventing excessive excitation in the olfactory cortex that is associated with epilepsy.  The olfactory cortex is the region of the brain most likely to experience epileptic seizures,  Isaacson said.  It s likely that the cells involved in processing odors also prevent seizures. Epilepsy can be recast as an abnormality in the function of these inhibitory neurons.  University of California, San Diego   Original reporting by: Christina Johnson & Scott LaFee James F.

Biologists have long wanted to know how this molecular motor -- called the ""dynein-dynactin complex"" -- works. But the complex's large size, myriad subunits and high flexibility have until now restricted structural studies to small pieces of the whole. In the new research, however, TSRI biologist Gabriel C. Lander and his laboratory, in collaboration with Trina A. Schroer and her group at Johns Hopkins University, created a picture of the whole dynein-dynactin structure. ""This work gives us critical insights into the regulation of the dynein motor and establishes a structural framework for understanding why defects in this system have been linked to diseases such as Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's,"" said Lander. The findings are reported in a Nature Structural & Molecular Biology advance online publication. The proteins dynein and dynactin normally work together on microtubules for cellular activities such as cell division and intracellular transport of critical cargo such as mitochondria and mRNA. The complex also plays a key role in neuronal development and repair, and problems with the dynein-dynactin motor system have been found in brain diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In addition, some viruses (including herpes, rabies and HIV) appear to hijack the dynein-dynactin transport system to get deep inside cells. ""Understanding how dynein and dynactin interact and work, and how they actually look, is definitely going to have medical relevance,"" said Research Associate Saikat Chowdhury, a member of the Lander lab who was first author of the study. To study the dynein-dynactin complex, Schroer's laboratory first produced individual dynein and dynactin proteins, which are themselves complicated, with multiple subunits, but have been so highly conserved by evolution that they are found in almost identical form in organisms from yeast to mammals. Chowdhury and Lander then used electron microscopy (EM) and cutting-edge image-processing techniques to develop two-dimensional ""snapshots"" of dynein's and dynactin's basic structures. These structural data contained unprecedented detail and revealed subunits never observed before. Chowdhury and Lander next developed a novel strategy to purify and image dynein and dynactin in complex together on a microtubule -- a railway-like structure, ubiquitous in cells, along which dynein-dynactin moves its cargoes. ""This is the first snapshot of how the whole dynein-dynactin complex looks and how it is oriented on the microtubule,"" Chowdhury said. The structural data clarify how dynein and dynactin fit together on a microtubule, how they recruit cargoes and how they manage to move those cargoes consistently in a single direction. Lander and Chowdhury now hope to build on the findings by producing a higher-resolution, three-dimensional image of the dynein-dynactin-microtubule complex, using an EM-related technique called electron tomography. ""The EM facility at TSRI is the best place in the world to push the limits of imaging complicated molecular machines like these,"" said Lander.

Researchers at the Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain used a new brain imaging technique to look at people experiencing pain over many hours. Activity in only one brain area, the dorsal posterior insula, reflected the participants' ratings of how much the pain hurt. These results, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, could help detect pain in people with limited communication abilities, such as those in a coma, small children and dementia patients. ""We have identified the brain area likely to be responsible for the core, 'it hurts', experience of pain,"" said Professor Irene Tracey, University of Oxford, whose team made the discovery. ""Pain is a complex, multidimensional experience, which causes activity in many brain regions involved with things like attention, feeling emotions such as fear, locating where the pain is, and so on. But the dorsal posterior insula seems to be specific to the actual 'hurt level' of pain itself."" ""We were able to find this area by developing a new method of tracking brain activity, based on a technique called arterial spin labeling. This allowed us to look at more complex brain states that stretch over much longer periods. By tracking pain felt over many hours, we were able to filter out more momentary experiences, such as variations in attention or fear,"" said Professor Tracey. The research team tracked brain activity in 17 healthy volunteers who had a cream containing capsaicin (the active ingredient in chillies) applied onto their right leg, causing a burning sensation. The volunteers indicated how much this burning sensation hurt. Once the pain sensation began to fade, the researchers 'rekindled' the sensation by putting a hot water bottle where the cream was applied. A few minutes later, they provided pain relief by switching to a cooling water bottle. The volunteers' ratings of how much the pain hurt accordingly went up and then down. Activity changes in the dorsal posterior insula tracked these changes in the volunteers' ratings of pain. The research team plans to verify these results by attempting to switch off this brain region in relevant patients suffering from intractable pain. The team hopes that changing activity in the dorsal posterior insula will help to treat pain where other methods have failed.

The study, by researchers at Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine (RowanSOM) and Rutgers New Jersey Medical School (NJMS), shows that BPA is not metabolized well in children with ASD. The research appears online in Autism Research.  It has been suspected for a lot of years that BPA is involved in autism, but there was no direct evidence,  said T. Peter Stein, of RowanSOM and the study s lead author.  We ve shown there is a link. The metabolism of BPA is different in some children with autism than it is in otherwise healthy children.  The research team   which included Margaret Schluter and Robert Steer, of RowanSOM who were responsible for laboratory analysis, and child neurologist Xue Ming, of NJMS who recruited and ascertained the study populations   examined urine specimens from 46 children with ASD and 52 healthy control children for both free BPA and total BPA concentrations. Like many chemicals, BPA becomes water soluble when it is bound to glucose in the liver   a process called glucuronidation. Conversion to a glucuronide and then excretion of the glucuronide in the urine is a major pathway for removing toxins from the body. The researchers also conducted a metabolomic analysis to screen for all the chemicals found in the children s urine. The metabolomics analyses showed the mean number of statistically significant correlations between metabolites detected and total BPA excreted to be approximately three times greater with the ASD group than the controls, and the number of statistical significant correlations with fraction of BPA bound was approximately15 times higher in the children with ASD (p<0.001).  Other studies involving rodent data have shown that BPA functions as an endocrine disruptor, but ours is the first to show this in humans and the first to associate it to autism,  Stein said.  The observations show that for some children there was a relationship between intermediary metabolism, the ability to conjugate BPA and symptoms of autism.  Although the study involves a relatively small number of subjects, Stein said,  The key point is that the study seems to link BPA to autism and creates an open area for further research. One implication of our study is that there might be a benefit to reducing BPA exposure for pregnant women and for children with autism.

The volunteers receiving TGN1412 experienced a catastrophic inflammatory reaction called a cytokine storm. Cytokine storm reactions are a particular worry for new biological therapies, or  biologics , which use biological material such as antibodies. Many blockbuster drugs such as the cancer drugs Herceptin and Avastin are biologics, as are around a third of medicines in the pharmaceutical pipeline. Because these medicines are specific to humans, they can cause severe reactions that don t materialise in animal studies, so tests on human cells are essential. However, cytokine storm side effects are hard to predict with tests were just one cell type is used, since they depend on interactions between blood cells and endothelial cells, which form the lining of blood vessels. But because endothelial cells are deep within the body, they are normally only grown from tissue removed in surgery or post mortem, or from umbilical vessels after birth. Because of this, current tests use endothelial cells taken from vessels of one donor, and white blood cells from a different donor.  When cells from two different donors are used, one may have an immune reaction to the other, meaning the system is already primed for inflammation before the drug is added. This can result in the test falsely showing a severe immune reaction to a drug that is safe. Researchers at Imperial College London got around this problem by isolating stem cells from the blood of a volunteer, and using them to grow endothelial cells in a dish. They then took white blood cells which they added to the donor s own endothelial cells to recreate the unique conditions found in their blood vessels. When TGN1412 was added to the test tube, the mixture of cells released a cytokine storm, as would happen inside the body. The new method is better as it only requires blood from one donor and doesn t mix cells from different people, with the advantage of making a more reliable test. Professor Jane Mitchell, from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London, who led the study, said:  As biological therapies become more mainstream, it s more likely that drugs being tested on humans for the first time will have unexpected and potentially catastrophic effects. We ve used adult stem cell technology to develop a laboratory test that could prevent another disaster like the TGN1412 trial.  Drug companies have the technical capacity to start using this test now, but we re working on developing an off-the-shelf kit which will make it easy to use on a large scale.  Dr Daniel Reed, the first author on the study, said:  A further benefit of this new technology is that personalised therapies can be tested to see how safe and effective they will be for an individual.  The Imperial researchers have collaborated with the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control to validate the test and are now working with the clinical trials company Quintiles to develop the technology further. The research is published in the FASEB Journal.","Published: March 9, 2015"

Instead, the research team led by bioengineering professor Kevin Healy is presenting a network of pulsating cardiac muscle cells housed in an inch-long silicone device that effectively models human heart tissue, and they have demonstrated the viability of this system as a drug-screening tool by testing it with cardiovascular medications. This organ-on-a-chip, reported in a study published on Monday, March 9, in the journal Scientific Reports, represents a major step forward in the development of accurate, faster methods of testing for drug toxicity. The project is funded through the Tissue Chip for Drug Screening Initiative, an interagency collaboration launched by the National Institutes of Health to develop 3-D human tissue chips that model the structure and function of human organs.  Ultimately, these chips could replace the use of animals to screen drugs for safety and efficacy,  said Healy. The study authors noted a high failure rate associated with the use of nonhuman animal models to predict human reactions to new drugs. Much of this is due to fundamental differences in biology between species, the researchers explained. For instance, the ion channels through which heart cells conduct electrical currents can vary in both number and type between humans and other animals.  Many cardiovascular drugs target those channels, so these differences often result in inefficient and costly experiments that do not provide accurate answers about the toxicity of a drug in humans,  said Healy.  It takes about $5 billion on average to develop a drug, and 60 percent of that figure comes from upfront costs in the research and development phase. Using a well-designed model of a human organ could significantly cut the cost and time of bringing a new drug to market.  The above video shows human heart tissue, derived from adult stem cells, before and after exposure to isoproterenol, a drug used to treat bradycardia (slow heart rate) and other heart problems. The beat rate visibly increased after 30 minutes of exposure to the drug. The heart cells were derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells, the adult stem cells that can be coaxed to become many different types of tissue. The researchers designed their cardiac microphysiological system, or heart-on-a-chip, so that its 3-D structure would be comparable to the geometry and spacing of connective tissue fiber in a human heart. They added the differentiated human heart cells into the loading area, a process that Healy likened to passengers boarding a subway train at rush hour. The system s confined geometry helps align the cells in multiple layers and in a single direction. Microfluidic channels on either side of the cell area serve as models for blood vessels, mimicking the exchange by diffusion of nutrients and drugs with human tissue. In the future, this setup could also allow researchers to monitor the removal of metabolic waste products from the cells.  This system is not a simple cell culture where tissue is being bathed in a static bath of liquid,  said study lead author Anurag Mathur, a postdoctoral scholar in Healy s lab and a California Institute for Regenerative Medicine fellow.  We designed this system so that it is dynamic; it replicates how tissue in our bodies actually gets exposed to nutrients and drugs.  Within 24 hours after the heart cells were loaded into the chamber, they began beating on their own at a normal physiological rate of 55 to 80 beats per minute. The researchers put the system to the test by monitoring the reaction of the heart cells to four well-known cardiovascular drugs: isoproterenol, E-4031, verapamil and metoprolol. They used changes in the heart tissue s beat rate to gauge the response to the compounds. The baseline beat rate for the heart tissue consistently fell within 55 to 80 beats per minute, a range considered normal for adult humans. They found that the responses after exposure to the drugs were predictable. For example, after half an hour of exposure to isoproterenol, a drug used to treat bradycardia (slow heart rate), the beat rate of the heart tissue increased from 55 to 124 beats per minute. The researchers noted that their heart-on-a-chip could be adapted to model human genetic diseases or to screen for an individual s reaction to drugs. They are also studying whether the system could be used to model multi-organ interactions. A standard tissue culture plate could potentially feature hundreds of microphysiological cell culture systems.  Linking heart and liver tissue would allow us to determine whether a drug that initially works fine in the heart might later be metabolized by the liver in a way that would be toxic,  said Healy. The engineered heart tissue remained viable and functional over multiple weeks. Given that time, it could be used to test various drugs, Healy said.","Published: March 9, 2015"

The disease is caused by a genetic defect that is passed from parent to child in the huntingtin gene. Having too many repeated elements in the gene sequence causes the disease and an increasing number of repeats leads to earlier onset and increased severity of the disease. Great efforts have been recently invested in research of biomarkers that would accurately determine the severity of Huntington s disease even before the onset of symptoms. A study by BUSM researchers, published in BMC Medical Genomics, may provide insight for treatments that would be effective in slowing down or postponing the death of neurons for people who carry the HD gene mutation, but who do not yet show symptoms of the disease. They studied the brains of people who died from HD and those who died of other, non-neurological diseases and identified a very specific genetic signal that strongly correlates disease severity and extent of neuronal or brain cell death. This genetic signal, also called a miR-10b-5p microRNA, silences certain genes that lead to the toxic effects of the huntingtin gene.  The findings that we found most interesting were the microRNAs that reflect the extent of the neuron death in the brain, since it is this process that causes the debilitating symptoms of the disease and eventually leads to the death of the individual,  explained senior author Richard H. Myers, PhD, Director of the Genome Science Institute at BUSM. According to the researchers these findings may represent a more effective way to tell whether or not HD treatments may be slowing down the pace of the death of brain cells.  If miR-10b-5p measurements can provide a faster and more effective way to determine whether or not a specific treatment is protecting brain neurons, it may be possible to study more potential treatments for HD more quickly. Equally importantly, it may become feasible to perform these trials in people who are HD gene carriers, but who do not yet show symptoms, by giving evidence for which trials may postpone onset and provide more healthy years of life,  added Myers. These findings also suggest that other microRNAs may also be important markers of severity for other neurological diseases such as Parkinson s disease and Alzheimer s disease. Further research is already being conducted in Parkinson s Disease by Myers and his colleagues.","Published: March 9, 2015"

Out of the 48,000 corneal transplants done, 10 percent of them end up in rejection, largely due to poor medication compliance. This costs the health care system and puts undue strain on clinicians, patients and their families. Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers may have discovered a way to prevent rejection by using biodegradable nanoparticles that release needed medication into the eye after surgery. This discovery could solve the decades-old issue of medicine compliance and help patients achieve corneal transplant success.  Medicine compliance is a major challenge in patient care,  says Walter Stark, M.D., chief of the Division of Cornea, Cataract and External Eye Diseases at Johns Hopkins.  About 60 to 80 percent of patients don t take medicine the way they are supposed to.  In an animal study being published in the March 10 issue of the Journal of Controlled Release, researchers looked into ways to alleviate the strain of adhering to a post-surgery treatment regimen that is sometimes hard to manage. Rats that underwent a corneal graft surgery were randomly divided into four groups and were given various treatments. One group was injected weekly for nine weeks with a safe, biodegradable nanoparticle loaded with corticosteroids for timed release of medicine. The other three groups received weekly injections of saline, placebo nanoparticles and free dexamethasone sodium phosphate aqueous solution after surgery, respectively. Treatments were given until the graft was clinically deemed as failed or until the nine-week test period concluded. Researchers looked at corneal transparency, swelling and growth of new blood vessels to decide if a graft had failed. For rats that received the nanoparticle loaded with corticosteroids, 65 percent of the treatment remained in the eye and did not leak within one week of the surgery. The concentration of the treatment also remained stronger than in the other three treatment groups. Additionally, there were no signs of swelling, and the cornea was clear throughout the test period. There were also far fewer instances of unwanted growth of new blood vessels in this group. Two weeks after surgery, rats that received the placebo nanoparticle and saline injections had severe swelling, opaque corneas and unwanted growth of new blood vessels, all indicating graft failure. After four weeks, rats that received free dexamethasone sodium phosphate aqueous solution all had graft failure as well. The only group that showed successful corneal transplant was the group of rats that received the corticosteroid-loaded nanoparticle injections. The grafts were still viable in 100 percent of these rats.  Corneal grafts are not easy to come by, and a lot of testing and time goes into ensuring the safe use of a graft for cornea transplant,  says Qingguo Xu, Ph.D., a research associate at the Center for Nanomedicine at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins Medicine.  This is why we want to do a better job at making sure corneal transplants don t end up in rejection, and our study illustrates a potentially better way.  The steroid-loaded nanoparticle treatment group showed no signs of corneal transplant rejection.  That s 100 percent efficacy, a very promising finding,  says Justin Hanes, Ph.D., director of the Center for Nanomedicine.  This type of treatment may also help prevent corneal transplant rejection in humans while making medicine adherence much easier on patients and their families.  The nanoparticle loaded with medication could eliminate the need for a patient to remember to take their medicine often multiple doses per hour after a surgery, alleviating compliance risk. These types of drug delivery systems could be paired with other drugs and used in other conditions, such as glaucoma, macular degeneration and corneal ulcers, among others. The research team intends to continue the collaboration between engineering and medicine to look further into better ways to treat eye diseases. Additional authors include Qing Pan, Nicholas J.

The study, published March 5 in the journal Molecular Cell, focuses on a few kinases   mainly ATR and ATM   that are involved in detecting and triggering responses to DNA damage in all human cells. Since our DNA may be replicated as many as 20 trillion times from fertilized egg through adulthood, there are many occasions for error and the need for repair.  The ATR protein is well-known to detect damage in our DNA and coordinate a response that ensures the efficient repair of the damage before the cell divides into two distinct cells,  said Marcus Smolka, associate professor of molecular biology and genetics in the Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, and senior author of the paper. Francisco Meirelles Bastos de Oliveira, a former postdoctoral researcher, is the paper s first author, along with graduate student Dongsung Kim, both in Smolka s lab. Damage that occurs during replication may be compared to a water pipe breaking in a municipality, said Smolka.  You need a system to detect when a water pipe breaks, and you need a group that makes and coordinates decisions to turn off the water, to notify people in the neighborhood, and to call a repair group,  Smolka said. In this analogy, ATR and ATM function as the group that detects and signals other entities for an appropriate response. In cancer cells, which reproduce very quickly, there is a great deal of DNA damage, as if  hundreds of water pipes are broken  at once, Smolka said.  Cancer cells highly depend on ATR to survive,  he added. Thus therapies that inhibit ATR may be effective in killing cancer cells, and, in fact, the first ATR inhibitors are entering early clinical trials. The ATR kinase, which was discovered in the 1990s, was thought to be recruited only in the event of DNA damage, but Smolka and colleagues have discovered that ATR also acts pre-emptively to prevent DNA lesions that lead to cell disorders and cell death. The work opens new opportunities to inhibit ATR and uncovers novel pathways controlled by this kinase. The new technique uses mass spectrometry to measure the mass of molecules with extremely high accuracy. Kinases signal actions by transferring phosphate groups to proteins. The transfer of a phosphate group regulates protein functions by activating and deactivating, changing location or degrading a protein, for example. The new technique uses exact mass measurements to detect these proteins (or substrates) and the transfer of phosphate groups. The researchers also found evidence of proteins that turn ATR on to transfer phosphate groups to other proteins. Though more than 500 kinases are known to exist, fewer than 100 are well-understood. The new technique offers a path for understanding the actions of all kinases in a highly quantitative way. Many kinases are involved centrally, not just in cancers, but also in diabetes and neurological disorders. The study used yeast cells, which contain kinases that are homologous to ATR and ATM. Co-authors include members of the Haiyuan Yu lab, also in the Weill Institute, and researchers from the University of South Florida.

Published March 2 in the journal Blood, the study led by Dr. Donald Kohn of the UCLA Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research outlines a method that corrects the mutated gene that causes sickle cell disease and shows, for the first time, that the gene correction method leads to the production of normal red blood cells. People with sickle cell disease are born with a mutation in their beta-globin gene that causes blood stem cells   which are made in the bone marrow   to produce rigid red blood cells that resemble a crescent or  sickle  shape. These abnormally shaped red blood cells do not move smoothly through blood vessels, resulting in insufficient oxygen to vital organs. The stem cell gene therapy method described in the study seeks to correct the mutation in the beta-globin gene so bone marrow stem cells produce normal, circular-shaped blood cells. The technique used specially engineered enzymes, called zinc-finger nucleases, to eliminate the mutated genetic code and replace it with a corrected version that repairs the beta-globin mutation. The research showed that the method holds the potential to permanently treat the disease if a higher level of correction is achieved.   This is a very exciting result,  said Kohn, professor of pediatrics and microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics.  It suggests the future direction for treating genetic diseases will be by correcting the specific mutation in a patient s genetic code. Since sickle cell disease was the first human genetic disease where we understood the fundamental gene defect, and since everyone with sickle cell has the exact same mutation in the beta-globin gene, it is a great target for this gene correction method.

The research was initiated in response to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011 following the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami. Farmers in nearby areas have faced hardships due to consumer fears about contamination, and measuring contamination in agricultural products was seen as a key to restoring public confidence. However, most monitoring is currently done with scintillation detectors that are located at the bottom of the testing container, requiring food to be ground into pieces so that it can be close enough to the detector to be accurately measured. Hence, the food put on store shelves cannot be the food that was actually measured. With the hope to ameliorate this situation, the joint team set out to develop a device with the scintillator set around the whole inner surface of the container, employing a lightweight plastic scintillator. However, according to Marco Casolino, ""We faced a difficulty. Plastic scintillators are not sensitive enough to easily distinguish between the naturally occurring potassium 40 and the artificial cesium isotopes. This is a problem because official regulations set the maximum level of cesium at near the level of natural potassium 40. Fortunately, we were able to develop a mathematical algorithm to separate the two taking advantage of the initial difference in photon energy, and now we are able to reliably detect the level of cesium in a large container, without harming the materials."" A key element to the device is a silicon photomultiplier, a type of device that was developed for use in space-based observatories. According to Casolino, ""This type of photomultiplier has certain characteristics that make them good choices for use in space, such as low power consumption and low cost. These same characteristics made them good choices for our detector."" A prototype of the LANFOS device, which is large enough to test entire food samples, was fabricated by G-Tech and tested at a festival in Minamisoma City, Fukushima, one of the areas contaminated by the accident. The device was tested on samples including potatoes, cabbage, and Japanese pears. According to Casolino, ""The local people were impressed at the machine s ability to rapidly give them a read-out of levels of radiation in the food, and this gave them hope that consumers might become more confident about buying their products."" This research was funded under the JST Development of Advanced Measurement and Analysis program. The system is scheduled to be presented on March 24 at the 70th Annual Meeting of the Physical Society of Japan.","Published: March 9, 2015"

Genetically modified (GM) soybean oil, made from seeds of GM soybean plants, was recently introduced into the food supply on the premise that it is healthier than conventional soybean oil. But is that premise true?Just barely, say scientists at the University of California, Riverside and their colleagues at UC Davis. The researchers compared the effects of both oils in experiments performed in the lab on mice. They found that the GM soybean oil is just as unhealthy as regular soybean oil in that it also induces obesity, diabetes and fatty liver. GM soybean oil does, however, have one advantage: it does not cause insulin resistance - the inability to efficiently use the hormone insulin.  While genetic modification of crops can introduce new beneficial traits into existing crops, the resulting products need to be tested for long-term health effects before making assumptions about their impact on human health,  said senior investigator Frances Sladek, a professor of cell biology and neuroscience at UC Riverside. Study results will be presented at the Endocrine Society s 97th annual meeting, currently taking place in San Diego, Calif., by Poonamjot Deol, an assistant project scientist in the Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience who is driving the project in the Sladek lab. Naturally high in unsaturated fats, vegetable oils were once thought to be healthy, and were hydrogenated to increase their shelf-life and temperature stability. The hydrogenation, however, generated trans fats - now widely recognized as being unhealthy. Soybean oil, the most common vegetable oil used in the United States, contains about 55 percent linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fat.  Our previous results on mice showed that replacing some of the fat in a diet high in saturated fats from coconut oil with soybean oil - to achieve a level common in the American diet - causes significantly more weight gain, adiposity, diabetes and insulin resistance than in mice fed just the high-fat coconut oil diet,  Sladek said. To determine whether linoleic acid was responsible for the metabolic effects of soybean oil, the researchers designed a parallel diet in which regular soybean oil was replaced, on a per gram basis, with GM soybean oil. The GM soybean oil has a fatty acid composition (low linoleic acid) similar to that of olive oil. The GM plants were developed by DuPont to reduce trans fat production, increase soybean oil shelf life and create a generally healthier cooking oil.  The GM soybean oil has 0 grams trans fat and more of the monounsaturated fats that are considered heart healthy,  Deol said.  But it had not been tested for long term metabolic effects until our current study.  Deol and the rest of the research team found to their surprise that the parallel diet containing GM soybean oil induced weight gain and fatty liver essentially identical to that of a diet with regular soybean oil, with the exception that the mice remained insulin sensitive and had somewhat less adipose (fat) tissue.  These results indicate that linoleic acid may contribute to insulin resistance and adiposity but that another as yet unidentified component of the soybean oil affects the liver and overall weight gain,  Deol said. In their experiments, the researchers gave four groups of mice different diets for 24 weeks. Each group was comprised of 12 mice. The control group received a low-fat diet (5 percent of daily calories from fat). The other groups received a diet with 40 percent of daily calories from fat, an amount common in the American diet. One diet was high in saturated fat from coconut oil, and one had 41 percent of the saturated fat replaced with regular soybean oil. The fourth group had 41 percent of the saturated fat replaced with the GM soybean oil. The body weights, food intake, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of all the mice were tracked. What the researchers found was that mice fed a diet with either of the soybean oils had worse fatty liver, glucose intolerance and obesity than the group that got all their fat from coconut oil. But the mice whose diet included the GM soybean oil had less fat tissue than the animals that ingested regular soybean oil. These mice weighed about 30 percent more than the controls that ate a low-fat diet, while the group on the diet containing regular soybean oil weighed 38 percent more than controls. The mice on the diet that was primarily coconut oil weighed only about 13 percent more than controls. Unlike the diet with regular soybean oil, the diet with the new GM soybean oil did not lead to insulin resistance.  While the GM soybean oil may have fewer negative metabolic consequences than regular soybean oil, it may not necessarily be as healthy as olive oil, as has been assumed by its fatty acid composition, and it is certainly less healthy than coconut oil which is primarily saturated fat,  Sladek said.  It is important to understand the metabolic effects and health impact of the GM soybean oil before it is widely adopted as a healthier alternative to regular soybean oil. It is equally important to understand the health effects of regular soybean oil, which is ubiquitous in the American diet and seems to be much more detrimental to metabolic health than saturated fat.  Sladek and Deol were joined in the research by Jane R. Evans, Antonia Rizo and Cynthia Perez at UCR; and Johannes Fahrmann, Dimitry Grapov, Jun Yang and Oliver Fiehn at UC Davis who performed extensive analysis on the liver and blood samples from these mice.  To our knowledge this is the first in-depth analysis of the metabolic effects of GM soybean oil, and the first metabolomics analysis comparing soybean oil - regular and GM - to coconut oil,  Deol said. The research was supported by a UCR Collaborative Seed Grant as well as grants from the UCR Agricultural Experiment Station, and the UC Davis West Coast Metabolomics Center, funded by the National Institutes of Health.

Academics at the University are investigating how bacteria found in children with CF can disarm their natural defence mechanisms, making it easier for more virulent bacteria to infect their airways. By the time many CF patients reach adulthood, they have already contracted the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial strain, which can cause extensive and eventually fatal damage to the lungs. The infection is currently extremely difficult to treat effectively. Dr Lindsay Marshall, who is leading the study, will use a replica model of a human airway with CF to treat early childhood infections with a range of antibiotics to calculate the extent to which P. aeruginosa can be stopped. The model, made entirely of human cells, was developed at Aston University and can accurately duplicate the workings of a human airway and the progression of the disease. Dr Marshall said:  We still do not fully understand the link between the cause of cystic fibrosis and the contraction of cystic fibrosis lung disease. There is a clear need to learn more about the disease process to allow us to develop new and better treatments to keep patients healthy for longer.  This project will also allow us to demonstrate how well our layered human cell model replicates CF lung disease and in what ways it could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of future treatments. We hope to use different human cell models in future to examine how the body s natural defences are altered by a variety of other inflammatory and infectious conditions.  A further major aim of the study, funded by a  99,336 Human Research Trust grant, is to establish new methods to reduce the number of animals used in respiratory studies. Last year in the UK, more than 115,000 animals were involved in testing for conditions including smoke-related lung diseases and asthma. Despite many species of animal being used for CF research, they do not naturally have the disease. It is costly to genetically manipulate them to contract a form of CF, which still does not recreate typical human CF. Dr Marshall added:  We simply cannot use animals to model the decline in lung function seen in people with CF, the infections typical of people with CF or the administration and dosage of drugs required to treat the condition. Our human CF model, which contains different layers of cells found naturally in the airways, is extremely representative of what happens in human airways and is both ethically and scientifically an improvement upon current animal models.  Cystic Fibrosis is the most common life-threatening inherited disease in the UK, affecting around 9,000 people. The condition causes the lungs to produce large quantities of thick, dehydrated mucus that block the airways, resulting in a decline in lung function with age and an increased susceptibility to infection. Thanks to the introduction of new treatments and therapies, the average life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis has risen to 41 years of age.","Published: March 7, 2015"

The protein, called HuR (human antigen R) is critical for controlling metabolism in B cells, which make antibodies that are essential in fighting infections and in developing long-term immunity after vaccination. Dr Kirsten Fairfax, now at Melbourne s Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, worked with Dr Manuel Diaz-Mu oz, Dr Martin Turner and colleagues at the Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK, on the discovery, published in the journal Nature Immunology. Maturing immunityDr Fairfax said the team showed removing HuR prevented the proper growth and function of B cells.  Immune cells called B cells mature in response to vaccines or exposure to new disease and are a key tenet of immunity,  she said.  HuR  manages  a set of genes that determine how much energy B cells produce, known as the metabolic rate.  We showed that without HuR to instruct them, these critical metabolic genes can no longer instruct the B cell to make the energy it needs to function, and B cells are unable to mature into antibody-producing cells that provide immunity to disease.  Powering the 'B cell factory'This final stage of maturation requires a substantial amount of energy and occurs in a  B-cell factory  called the germinal centre, Dr Fairfax said.  Germinal centres are the quality control check point for B cells,  she said.  B cells that pass the test mature and transform into antibody-producing (plasma) cells, while those that fail quality control start the maturation process again.  If the immune cell s metabolism isn t functioning properly, maturation in the germinal centre stalls and plasma B cells cannot develop,  she said. This is potentially disastrous for the immune system as plasma B cells protect the body from infections and generate immunity after vaccination to prepare for future infections.  Anticipating side-effectsUnderstanding the processes that control B cell development, including metabolism, can help scientists find ways to boost the efficacy of vaccines or preserve the body s ability to develop immunity.  As an example, some anti-cancer drugs that are used over extended treatment periods can impact cell metabolism,  Dr Fairfax said.  If these drugs impact on the metabolism of B cells, it may compromise a patient s ability to create the new plasma B cells required to prevent infections. Identifying which drugs have this impact and monitoring patients receiving these drugs will help clinicians guide cancer patients through treatment while ensuring efforts to restore their immune system are effective.

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $39.0 million, or $1.34 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to $30.1 million, or $1.04 per share during the same period in 2013. Impacting the fourth quarter of 2014 was $11.4 million of expense associated with a product line discontinuation and $7.0 million reflecting the re-valuation of contingent consideration related to prior acquisitions. The fourth quarter of 2014 benefitted from no accrual of settlement costs associated with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (FCPA) matter, compared to the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 of 14.7% was significantly lower than the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2013 of 32.3% mainly due to the reinstatement of the 2014 U.S. research & development tax credit and releases of valuation allowances and tax reserves. For the full year of 2014, sales were $2,175.0 million compared to $2,132.7 million in 2013, an increase of 2.0%, or 3.3% on a currency neutral basis. Full-year gross margin was 54.2% compared to 55.3% reported in 2013. The net decline in gross margin is largely attributable to $11.6 million resulting from plant closures and product line discontinuations. Full-year net income in 2014 was $88.8 million, or $3.05 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to $77.8 million, or $2.69 per share in 2013. The change in net income was primarily due to a reduction of $18.7 million of annual interest expense in 2014 arising from the redemption of Senior Subordinated Notes in September 2013 and $15.0 million less in settlement costs associated with the FCPA matter. These items were offset in large part by the overall impact of $14.7 million from plant closures and product line discontinuations as well as additional investment associated with our April 2014 acquisition of GnuBIO. As announced previously, in the fourth quarter of 2014 the Company settled the previously disclosed investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the FCPA matter and paid approximately $55 million in resolution. ""In the absence of currency headwinds experienced in the latter part of the year, we are encouraged with our underlying performance in the fourth quarter and the entire year,"" said Norman Schwartz, Bio-Rad President and Chief Executive Officer. ""The year was one of progress on many fronts and we look forward to 2015."" Life ScienceThe Life Science segment net sales for the fourth quarter were $223.7 million, up 1.5% compared to the same period in 2013. On a currency-neutral basis, Life Science segment sales increased by 6.3%. The sales increase during the quarter reflected growth in the segment s core businesses, in particular, sales of gene expression and protein quantification products and the Company s QX200  Droplet Digital  PCR system. During the quarter Bio-Rad introduced its S3e  Cell Sorter, an enhanced system for cell analysis. Full-year reported revenues for the Life Science segment were $728.3 million, up 2.6% compared to the same period in 2013, or an increase of 4.0% on a currency-neutral basis. Clinical DiagnosticsThe Clinical Diagnostics segment reported net sales of $370.3 million for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 2.0% compared to the same period in 2013. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 3.6%. Results from the fourth quarter reflected growth across most product lines, most notably immunology, quality controls, and diabetes products. During the fourth quarter, the Company announced that it had received Premarket Application approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the Company s Geenius  HIV 1/2 Supplemental Assay. The assay is a single-use test intended for use as an additional, more specific, test to confirm the presence of and differentiate antibodies to HIV Types 1 and 2. Full-year reported revenues for the Clinical Diagnostics segment were $1,432.3 million, up 1.7% compared to the same period in 2013. On a currency-neutral basis, full-year sales increased 2.9% compared to 2013. 2014 Full-Year Highlights   Full-year, sales were $2,175.0 million compared to $2,132.7 million in 2013. After normalizing for the impact of currency effects, full year revenues increased 3.3%.  Year-over-year net income was $88.8 million, or $3.05 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to $77.8 million, or $2.69 per share in 2013.  In April, Bio-Rad purchased GnuBIO, a droplet-based DNA sequencing technology that is intended to integrate workflow for medical diagnostics.  Also during the second quarter, Bio-Rad announced the launch of two new kits for its fully-automated BioPlex  2200 system: the BioPlex  2200 HIV Ag-Ab kit, a first-in-class 5th generation HIV test, and the BioPlex  2200 25-OH Vitamin D kit. Both kits were launched in markets outside the U.S.  In September, Bio-Rad introduced ZOE  Fluorescent Cell Imager, a digital imaging system that simplifies fluorescence imaging for cell culture applications.  During the fourth quarter Bio-Rad introduced the S3e Cell Sorter, a benchtop platform to improve cell research.  Also during the fourth quarter, Bio-Rad expanded its family of NGC  Medium-Pressure Chromatography Systems launching the NGC Discover  and NGC  Discover Pro Systems.  In November, Bio-Rad received Premarket Application approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the Company s Geenius HIV 1/2 Supplemental Assay.","Published: March 7, 2015"

A team of researchers from the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit t M nchen (LMU) has now discovered that the self-renewal rate of the stem cells is however, limited, explaining why their number drops over the course of a lifetime. This work now sets the basis for further investigation of the signaling pathways that maintain the stem cells. The results have been published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. The generation of neurons (neurogenesis) in humans is predominantly limited to development; in the adult stage it takes place in only a few regions of the brain. These regions contain neural stem cells that generate neurons in a process with various intermediary stages. Until now it was thought that maintaining the stem cell pool was based on the self-renewal of individual stem cells. The team of scientists headed by Dr. Jovica Ninkovic and Professor Dr. Magdalena G tz were able to refute this: Both the self-renewal rate and the diversity of neurons formed from the stem cells are limited, and the number of stem cells decreases with age.""Our findings explain why neurogenesis declines in later years, as there are fewer and fewer neural stem cells. At the same time, we gained new knowledge on basic mechanisms of neurogenesis that until now were not understood,"" says first author Dr. Filippo Calzolari. Approaches to new therapies for brain diseases, such as stroke or dementia, for example, particularly concentrate on replacing lost neurons by stimulating the generation of new cells from stem cells. ""In light of the fact that the stem cell supply is limited, we must now also look for ways to promote the self-renewal rate of the stem cells themselves and maintain the supply for a longer time,"" emphasizes G tz, Director of the Institute for Stem Cell Research at the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen and Chair of the Institute of Physiological Genomics at LMU.

People with anorexia have such an intense fear of gaining weight that they starve themselves even when they are dangerously thin. Body dysmorphic disorder is a psychiatric condition characterized by an obsessive preoccupation with a perceived flaw in physical appearance. The researchers found that people with both disorders had abnormal activity in the visual cortex of the brain during the very first instants when the brain processes  global  information, or images as a whole, as opposed to a tiny detail. According to the authors, it could also mean that perceptual retraining may be an effective therapy for both disorders. Perceptual retraining is a behavioral exercise that attempts to help adjust or correct the participant s balance of global and detailed processing. For both of these disorders, participants are encouraged to not focus on details and process objects more globally. Previous research on body dysmorphic disorder has shown the same type of abnormal activity in the visual cortex, but the UCLA study was the first to link the locations of the abnormal brain activity with time periods beginning as early as one-tenth of a second after an image is viewed. Understanding that timing is significant, the authors write, because it may help scientists determine whether the problem is in lower-level perception that takes place in the visual cortex, or elsewhere in higher-level brain systems. The study currently appears in online in the journal Psychological Medicine. The UCLA researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect regional abnormalities in visual processing and electroencephalography (EEG) to assess the timeline for how the brain processes those signals. They compared results for 15 people with anorexia nervosa, 15 people with body dysmorphic disorder and 15 healthy individuals.  We now know that these abnormalities may be happening at the very early stages when the brain begins processing visual input, and that the similar distortions in perception shared by anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder may have similar neurobiological origins,  said Wei Li, a student in the UCLA Interdepartmental Ph.D. Program for Neuroscience and the study s first author.  This understanding has the potential to lead to new strategies that can improve the way we treat these disorders.  People with anorexia nervosa have a distorted sense of their body weight and shape. The disorder, which typically develops in adolescence, can lead to social withdrawal, cardiovascular or electrolyte disturbances severe enough to require hospitalization, and even death. There are few effective treatments, and many symptoms can be life-long. Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder see themselves as disfigured and ugly, even though they look normal to others. Those suffering from the disorder tend to fixate on minute details on their faces or bodies, and distress with their appearance can result in depression, anxiety, shame and severe functional impairment, which can lead to hospitalization and, in some cases, even suicide. The disorder affects approximately 2 percent of the population, making it more prevalent than schizophrenia or bipolar disorder   yet scientists know relatively little about the biology underlying the disease. Although the two disorders share similar body image distortions, and are often diagnosed in the same person, no previous study directly compared the abnormalities in visual information processing that could significantly contribute to them, nor compared their neurobiology.  Previously, we knew where these visual processing abnormalities existed in the brain in body dysmorphic disorder, but did not know when they were taking place,  said Dr. Jamie Feusner, the paper s senior author, a UCLA associate professor of psychiatry and director of the Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Program at the UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior.  Now, knowing the timing, it is clearer that their perceptual distortions are more likely to be rooted early in their visual systems.  Also, the fact that the results were recorded while people were viewing other people s faces and images of houses suggests that this may be a more general abnormality in visual processing,  Feusner said. The UCLA researchers found that people with anorexia and those with body dysmorphic disorder showed less activity in the regions of the brain that convey primarily global information, although the effect appeared in smaller regions in those with anorexia. Further, the researchers found that individuals with body dysmorphic disorder exhibited greater activity in the areas of the brain that process detailed information. Interestingly, the more activity they had in these detail-processing regions, the less attractive they perceived the faces to be, suggesting a connection with distorted perceptions of appearance. Both differences were linked to electrical activity occurring within the first 200 milliseconds after the person viewed an image.  Among the questions to be answered in future research is whether this dysfunction improves as a result of treatment, and if not, what perceptual retraining techniques could help sufferers of these illnesses,  Li said.

Researchers from Lund University and Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, in close cooperation with a group led by Professor Jos  L. Venero at the University of Seville, have presented new findings about some of the 'key players' in inflammation. In the long term, these findings could lead to new treatments. One of these key players is a receptor called TLR4. The receptor plays such an important role in the body's innate immune system that the researchers who discovered it were awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The other key player is a protein called galectin-3, which is absent in healthy brains but present in a brain suffering ongoing inflammation. ""We have demonstrated that galectin-3 is secreted by microglial cells, a type of immune cell in the brain. The protein binds to the TLR4 receptor and amplifies the reactions that lead to inflammation. More galectin-3 is produced and binds to the immune cells, and the immune response is further intensified in a self-sustaining process,"" explained Tomas Deierborg, associate professor at Lund University. The researchers have demonstrated the importance of the link between the two 'key players' using various different methods and in laboratory tests, animal experiments and human trials. They have shown that mice genetically modified to be incapable of synthesising galectin-3 show a lower inflammatory response and less brain damage after a heart attack. Mice with a model of Parkinson's disease also suffer less brain damage if they do not have the gene for galectin-3. The researchers have also observed the interaction between galectin-3 and TLR4 in the brains of people who died of a stroke. ""We believe that this link could be part of the explanation for the residual disability that stroke patients often experience. High levels of galectin-3 remain in the brains of these patients long after the stroke, which may explain why the inflammatory response continues to cause damage and does not subside,"" said Miguel Angel Burguillos, currently working at Queen Mary University of London. Galectin-3 is already a target for pharmaceutical companies trying to develop agents that hinder the harmful effects of the protein in neuroinflammatory diseases. The new findings on the effects and role of the protein in a diseased or damaged brain should provide important input to this work. ""Previously, it was acknowledged that galectin-3 contributed to the inflammatory response but the mechanism wasn't clear. The protein is not present in a healthy brain, only in one that is suffering an inflammatory response. Now that we understand the mechanism, this will make it easier to develop more effective treatments,"" said Dr Deierborg.

Only when they share the descriptions of an ear, tail, trunk and leg do they know it is an elephant. Rajesh Kana, Ph.D., of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) has brought a similar approach to the classification, and eventual diagnosis, of autism. Kana and colleagues are the first to combine three different measures of the brain -- anatomy, the connectivity between different brain regions, and levels of a neurochemical -- to distinguish people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from matched, typically developing peers. This multimodal approach, published in the journal Cortex, is distinct from many previous studies that have used a single neuroimaging measure. While those studies uncovered widespread functional and anatomical brain abnormalities in ASD, the results were not highly consistent, possibly reflecting the complex brain pathology in autism spectrum disorders. At this time, autism diagnosis is based on behavior. Kana's multimodal neuroimaging-based classification is a step toward a possible biomarker for autism and possibly diagnosing autism at an early age, perhaps as early as 6 months, when the brain is very plastic and intervention might be more effective. ""But that's a long, long way off,"" said Kana, an associate professor in the Department of Psychology in the UAB College of Arts and Sciences and an associate scientist in UAB's Civitan International Research Center. This preliminary study needs to be validated with a larger sample, Kana said; but it ""emphasizes that the brain abnormalities in autism may not be confined to a single area. Rather, they are distributed across different areas at multiple levels and layers."" Kana, corresponding author of the study, examined 19 high-functioning adults with ASD and 18 typically developing peers, who were matched for age and intelligence. Using the 3-Tesla scanner in the UAB Civitan Functional Neuroimaging Laboratory, Kana's group performed structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure brain cortical thickness (volume data), diffusion tensor imaging to measure the connectivity of white-matter fibers of the brain, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure brain neurotransmitters like N-acetylaspartate. The brain's white-matter areas are like electrical cables that link different regions of the brain. The same MRI machine does all three measurements, using different settings for each. The volume data take 10 minutes, connectivity measurements take12 minutes and the spectroscopy takes 30 minutes. While some participants were comfortable in the tight space of an MRI, others needed training in a nonfunctioning simulator MRI before any testing. Kana's group found significant differences in some specific measurements using each of the three neuroimaging approaches. They then combined certain of these key differences into a decision tree model -- akin to the differential diagnosis flowchart used by clinicians. This decision-tree model gave a classification accuracy of 91.9 percent for distinguishing ASD subjects from the controls. ""Autism is such a heterogeneous disorder, and every patient presents with different symptoms and levels of severity,"" said Lauren Libero, Ph.D., first author of the study. ""That makes it really challenging to try to find one explanation within the brain for the very complex symptoms of autism."" ""This study is important,"" said Libero who is now a post-doctoral scholar at the University of California-Davis MIND Institute (Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders), ""because we found that different combinations of alterations in the brain could lead to the same or different levels of symptom severity. This could explain why previous studies have found varying results when it comes to which areas of the brain are affected in autism. There likely is not one uniform pattern affecting everyone with autism."" ""We also found that combining different MRI techniques led to better classification of our participants with autism,"" Libero said. ""Most previous studies have focused on using one technique at a time, even though we have evidence that there are alterations in the brain in autism in terms of structure, white-matter connectivity, and brain chemical concentrations. When we are looking at a disorder that is so complex, multiple modalities of investigation can be more efficient to separate autism from other disorders, or to identify subgroups within autism. Our study found a way to combine measures of brain structure, white matter diffusion, and neurochemical concentration to classify our participants by their diagnosis, as well as their level of autism severity."" This start by Kana and colleagues to unlock the neuropathology of autism needs to be validated using a larger sample of subjects to improve the generalizability of these preliminary findings. Kana also wants to look at lower-functioning ASD subjects, younger ASD children and a larger number of female participants. Lucina Uddin, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Miami, who was not part of the research team, said, ""The combination of multiple neuroimaging modalities is a clear strength of the current study, and the authors are to be commended for undertaking the difficult task of trying to reconcile results from methods designed to tap different aspects of brain structure and function. Although the classification results are promising, application to new and larger datasets will be critical for testing how well the classifier built here deals with new cases. In addition, it will be interesting to see whether data collected from much younger children can be classified using this method, as the disorder typically emerges in the first few years of life."" Specific significant findings in the Libero et al. Cortex paper include: Just three of these significant differences -- radial diffusivity in the right forceps minor, cortical thickness in the left pars opercularis and fractional anisotropy in the left forceps minor -- yielded the best decision tree for distinguishing ASD participants from controls. Kana and colleagues also built a decision tree with five of the significant findings that sorted ASD participants by disease severity. ASD is a complex disorder of brain development. ASD patients show a triad of impairments: impaired social interaction with others, impaired verbal and nonverbal communication, and impaired play and imaginative activities.

Experts believe the findings could aid future research by overcoming the difficulty of accessing some tumour samples. The researchers analyzed blood samples from patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer and looked for  circulating free DNA  - bits of DNA shed from tumour cells that can be isolated from the blood. They found that the tumour DNA present in blood samples could be used to identify different types of tumour-causing genetic faults in a gene called EGFR. The study, published in the journal JAMA Oncology, analyzed blood samples from 97 patients who took part in the EURTAC clinical trial. And in 78 per cent of the blood samples tested, two important genetic faults were successfully identified. Dr Dana Tsui, cancer genetics scientist at Cancer Research UK s Cambridge Institute, said:  This important study shows the potential of  liquid biopsies  in opening up new research opportunities - when previously it s been difficult to get tumour samples from patients. This research adds to the growing evidence that getting tumour DNA from blood samples could be a reliable way to identify important genetic faults in lung cancer patients.  The study also looks at the effect of different genetic faults within the EGFR molecule on patient survival - something that s been difficult to answer before the development of this technology,  explained Tsui. They found that the presence of a particular fault in EGFR found in DNA isolated from blood - called L858R - was linked to poorer survival than the second fault analyzed in the study. The researchers believe their findings raise the question of whether the tumour DNA present in blood samples could offer a less invasive way of searching for key genetic faults in the future.","Published: March 7, 2015"

The Familial Breast Cancer Research Unit is a world leader in the field of breast and ovarian cancer genetics. The collaboration will utilize WaferGen s Seq-Ready  TE System, with the goal of enabling affordable, large-scale BRCA1 and BRCA2 screening for the general population. The research conducted around the collaboration will be led by Dr. Steven Narod, Director, Familial Breast Cancer Research Unit, Women s College Research Institute, and Professor at the Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, and Dr. Mohammad Akbari, Assistant Professor, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto and Scientist at Women s College Research Institute.  We believe that there is a significant medical benefit to providing BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing for the general population,  stated Dr. Narod, co-discoverer of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.  The current guidelines used for selecting patients for genetic testing overlook a significant proportion of carriers who could potentially be identified through a population-based screening. However, in order to offer large-scale genetic screening, an accurate, low-cost test will need to be developed. Based on our experience, we think WaferGen s Seq-Ready  TE Syste has the potential to enable the development of such a test.   We evaluated a number of possible solutions in order to identify the best available testing technology, and determined that WaferGen s sample preparation solution for next generation sequencing was cost effective and user-friendly,  added Dr. Akabari.  We now look forward to assessing WaferGen s Seq-Ready  TE System on a larger scale.   We are very excited to work with Dr. Narod and Dr. Akbari and their team on developing a large scale solution for BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 testing,  said Ivan Trifunovich, President and Chief Executive Officer at WaferGen.  WaferGen s Seq-Ready  TE system enables a one-step target enrichment and library preparation solution, which addresses CLIA-certified clinical laboratories  significant unmet needs in sequencing-based testing by providing uniform coverage of targeted genes, yielding better test specificity and sensitivity. The superior performance of this new product is based on WaferGen s proprietary technology that relies on massively parallel singleplex PCR, where amplification is cleaner and better controlled, resulting in more accurate variant calling.

Communication between these regions is important for abilities like how a baseball player is able to estimate where to swing his bat or how a person finds a car in a large parking lot filled with similar cars.","Published: March 6, 2015"

The findings are published in the journal Cell. Neural circuits are responsible for flexible goal-oriented behaviors. The Yale team investigated how a population of neurons in the hypothalamus that control food intake are also involved in other behaviors. Known as Agrp neurons, these cells also control repetitive, stereotypic behaviors in mice when food is not available, the researchers discovered. The team tested the behavior of mice after the Agrp neurons were activated. They found that in the absence of food, mice engaged in repetitive behaviors, such as grooming and marble burying. They further demonstrated that these behaviors were goal-oriented and not related to anxiety. ""These observations unmask the relevance of primitive brain regions previously linked to eating to other complex behaviors,"" said lead author Marcelo Dietrich, M.D., assistant professor of comparative medicine and neurobiology and a member of the Yale Program in Integrative Cell Signaling and Neurobiology of Metabolism at Yale School of Medicine. ""These findings are relevant to understanding diseases with both homeostatic and compulsive components and highlight the multitasking nature of neurons in the brain."" According to Dietrich, the data suggests that these primitive brain regions play a crucial role in psychiatric conditions. ""The research lays the groundwork for possible clinical trials to address the behavioral aspects of anorexia nervosa and other neuropsychiatric diseases with compulsive behavioral components,"" he said.

The study results, which were presented March 5 at the Endocrine Society's 97th annual meeting in San Diego, suggest that the common practice of treating pregnant women who have mild thyroid hormone deficiency may pose unexpected risks to the developing baby's brain. Doctors already know that low thyroid hormone levels in pregnant women are linked to lower child IQ scores as well as other risks to the fetus. Based on current evidence, treatment guidelines from the American Thyroid Association in 2011 and the Endocrine Society in 2012 recommend medical treatment of pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism. In this mild form of thyroid disease, there is an increased amount of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), the substance that spurs production of and maintains adequate amounts of the thyroid hormones, T3 and T4, which control how your body uses energy. ""There is consensus to treat subclinical hypothyroidism because it is generally believed that the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risks of overtreatment,"" said Tim Korevaar, MD, the study's lead investigator and a PhD student at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. ""There was virtually no evidence in humans until now that mildly elevated levels of thyroid hormone could also be harmful."" Korevaar and colleagues evaluated data from 3,839 mother-child pairs who participated in the Dutch Generation R Study, an ongoing study from fetal life until young adulthood. Between pregnancy weeks 9 and 18, mothers underwent bloodwork to measure their TSH and free T4--the active form of T4. The children to whom the women gave birth received an IQ test on nonverbal performance tasks between the age of 5 and 8 years. The researchers found that the average nonverbal IQ of the children significantly decreased 2.1 to 3.8 points below the average of the reference group (those with free T4 levels in the middle of the range) when the mothers' free T4 level was at or above the 89th percentile. This percentile is considered well into the normal range, according to Korevaar. The average child IQ decreased by a similar number of points when maternal free T4 levels were at or below the eighth percentile, indicating low-normal values. Percentiles were calculated because different countries and hospitals use different methods to measure free T4. What is important in this study, Korevaar said, is that a U-shaped relationship--meaning that both low and high TSH levels were associated with lower child IQ levels--was evident over the entire range of maternal free T4 levels. The researchers found no independent association between women's TSH level and changes in child IQ. ""The proportion of pregnant women with mild thyroid dysfunction who receive thyroid hormone supplementation is rapidly increasing, according to European and American surveys,"" Korevaar said. ""Thyroid hormone supplementation during pregnancy may come with the risk of overtreatment, and even treatment to a high-normal level on thyroid function tests early in pregnancy may not be without risks to the child.

Unlike in rhesus monkeys and mice, these switches show increased activity in humans, where they may drive the expression of genes in the cerebral cortex, the region of the brain that is involved in conscious thought and language. This difference may explain why the structure and function of that part of the brain is so unique in humans compared to other mammals. The research, led by James P. Noonan, Steven K. Reilly, and Jun Yin, is published in the journal Science. In addition to creating a rich and detailed catalog of human-specific changes in gene regulation, Noonan and his colleagues pinpointed several biological processes potentially guided by these regulatory elements that are crucial to human brain development.  Building a more complex cortex likely involves several things: making more cells, modifying the functions of cortical areas, and changing the connections neurons make with each other. And the regulatory changes we found in humans are associated with those processes,  said Noonan, associate professor of genetics, an investigator with the Kavli Institute for Neuroscience, and senior author of the study.  This likely involves evolutionary modifications to cellular proliferation, cortical patterning, and other developmental processes that are generally well conserved across many species."" Scientists have become adept at comparing the genomes of different species to identify the DNA sequence changes that underlie those differences. But many human genes are very similar to those of other primates, which suggests that changes in the way genes are regulated   in addition to changes in the genes themselves   is what sets human biology apart. Up to this point, however, it has been very challenging to measure those changes and figure out their impact, especially in the developing brain. The Yale researchers took advantage of new experimental and computational tools to identify active regulatory elements   those DNA sequences that switch genes on or off at specific times and in specific cell types   directly in the human cortex and to study their biological effects. First, Noonan and his colleagues mapped active regulatory elements in the human genome during the first 12 weeks of cortical development by searching for specific biochemical, or  epigenetic  modifications. They did the same in the developing brains of rhesus monkeys and mice, then compared the three maps to identify those elements that showed greater activity in the developing human brain. They found several thousand regulatory elements that showed increased activity in human. Next, they wanted to know the biological impact of those regulatory changes. The team turned to BrainSpan, a freely available digital atlas of gene expression in the brain throughout the human lifespan. (BrainSpan was led by Kavli Institute member Nenad Sestan at Yale, with contributions from Noonan and Pasko Rakic, a co-author on this study.) They used those data to identify groups of genes that showed coordinated expression in the cerebral cortex. They then overlaid the regulatory changes they had found with these groups of genes and identified several biological processes associated with a surprisingly high number of regulatory changes in humans.  While we often think of the human brain as a highly innovative structure, it s been surprising that so many of these regulatory elements seem to play a role in ancient processes important for building the cortex in all mammals, said first author Steven Reilly.  However, this is often a hallmark of evolution, tinkering with the tools available to produce new features and functions.  Next, Noonan and colleagues plan to investigate the function of some of the regulatory changes they identified by introducing them into the mouse genome and studying their effects on mouse brain development.

The gas can originate from lakes and swamps, natural-gas pipelines, deep-sea vents, and livestock. Understanding the sources of methane, and how the gas is formed, could give scientists a better understanding of its role in warming the planet. Now a research team led by scientists at MIT and including colleagues from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the University of Toronto, and elsewhere has developed an instrument that can rapidly and precisely analyze samples of environmental methane to determine how the gas was formed. The approach, called tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy, detects the ratio of methane isotopes, which can provide a  fingerprint  to differentiate between two common origins: microbial, in which microorganisms, typically living in wetlands or the guts of animals, produce methane as a metabolic byproduct; or thermogenic, in which organic matter, buried deep within the Earth, decays to methane at high temperatures. The researchers used the technique to analyze methane samples from settings including lakes, swamps, groundwater, deep-sea vents, and the guts of cows, as well as methane generated by microbes in the lab.  We are interested in the question,  Where does methane come from?  says Shuhei Ono, an assistant professor of geochemistry in MIT s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.  If we can partition how much is from cows, natural gas, and other sources, we can more reliably strategize what to do about global warming.  Ono and his colleagues, including first author and graduate student David Wang, publish their results in the journal Science. Locking in on methane s frequency Methane is a molecule composed of one carbon atom linked to four hydrogen atoms. Carbon can come as one of two isotopes (carbon-12 or carbon-13); hydrogen can also take two forms, including as deuterium   an isotope of hydrogen with one extra neutron. The authors looked for a very rare molecule of doubly isotope-substituted methane, known as 13CH3D   a molecule with both an atom of carbon-13 and a deuterium atom. Detecting 13CH3D was crucial, the researchers reasoned, as it may be a signal of the temperature at which methane formed   essential for determining whether methane is microbial or thermogenic in origin. Last year, Ono and colleagues, working with scientists from Aerodyne Research, built an instrument to detect 13CH3D. The technique uses infrared spectroscopy to detect specific frequencies corresponding to minute motions within molecules of methane; different frequencies correspond to different isotopes. This spectroscopic approach, which is fundamentally different from the classical mass spectrometric methods being developed by others, has the advantage of portability, allowing its potential deployment in field locations. Methane s pulse The team collected samples of methane from settings such as lakes, swamps, natural gas reservoirs, the digestive tracts of cows, and deep ancient groundwater, as well as methane made by microbes in the lab. The group noticed something surprising and unexpected in some samples. For example, based on the isotope ratios they detected in cow rumen, they calculated that this methane formed at 400 degrees Celsius   impossible, as cow stomachs are typically about 40 C. They observed similar incongruences in samples from lakes and swamps. The isotope ratios, they reasoned, must not be a perfect indicator of temperature. Instead, Wang and his colleagues identified a relationship between a feature of the bonds linking carbon and hydrogen in methane molecules   a quality they deemed  clumpiness    and the rate at which methane was produced: The clumpier the bond, the slower the rate of methanogenesis.  Cow guts produce methane at very high rates   up to 500 liters a day per cow. They re giant methane fermenters, and they prefer to make less-clumped methane, compared to geologic processes, which happen very slowly,  Wang says.  We re measuring a degree of clumpiness of the carbon and hydrogen isotopes that helps us get an idea of how fast the methane formed.  The researchers applied this new interpretation to methane formed by microbes in the lab, and found good agreement between the isotopes detected and the rates at which the gas formed. They then used the technique to analyze methane from Kidd Creek Mine, in Canada   one of the deepest accessible points on Earth   and two sites in California where the Earth s mantle rock reacts with groundwater. These are sites in which the origins of methane were unclear.  It s been a longstanding question how those fluids were developed,  Wang says.  Now we have a baseline that we can use to explore how methane forms in environments on Earth and beyond.  Robert Hazen, executive director of the Deep Carbon Observatory in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the research, sees the group s new detector as  a radical departure from traditional mass spectrometer techniques. This new approach offers significant advantages in terms of it size, expenses, and adaptability to multiple clumped isotope systems. One can even envision a time when a portable unit might be used in field studies. That's an amazing advance.  This research was funded in part by the National Science Foundation, Shell Oil, the Deep Carbon Observatory, the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and the German Research Foundation.","Published: March 6, 2015"

The team headed by Silke Meiners, Oliver Eickelberg and Sabine van Rijt from the Comprehensive Pneumology Center (HMGU), working with colleagues from the Chemistry Department (LMU) headed by Thomas Bein, were able to show nanoparticles' selective drug release to human lung tumour tissue for the first time. Tumour specific proteins were used to release drugs from the nanocarriers Tumour tissue in the lung contains high concentrations of certain proteases, which are enzymes that break down and cut specific proteins. The scientists took advantage of this by modifying the nanocarriers with a protective layer that only these proteases can break down, a process that then releases the drug. Protease concentrations in the healthy lung tissue are too low to cleave this protective layer and so the medicines stay protected in the nanocarrier. ""Using these nanocarriers we can very selectively release a drug such as a chemotherapeutic agent specifically at the lung tumour,"" reports research group leader Meiners. ""We observed that the drug's effectiveness in the tumour tissue was 10 to 25 times greater compared to when the drugs were used on their own. At the same time, this approach also makes it possible to decrease the total dose of medicines and consequently to reduce undesirable effects.""

The research may have implications for future treatments of psychological conditions such as autism, said the study's lead author Brian Haas, an assistant professor in the department of psychology. Each autism diagnosis is on a spectrum and varies, but some diagnosed with the condition exhibit problems trusting other people. ""There are conditions, like autism, that are characterized by deficits in being able to process the world socially, one of which is the ability to trust people,"" Haas said. ""Here we have converging evidence that these brain regions are important for trust; and if we can understand how these differences relate to specific social processes, then we may be able to develop more targeted treatment techniques for people who have deficits in social cognition."" Haas and his team of researchers used two measures to determine the trust levels of 82 study participants. Participants filled out a self-reported questionnaire about their tendency to trust others. They also were shown pictures of faces with neutral facial expressions and asked to evaluate how trustworthy they found each person in the picture. This gave researchers a metric, on a spectrum, of how trusting each participant was of others. Researchers then took MRI scans of the participants' brains to determine how brain structure is associated with the tendency to be more trusting of others. What researchers found, said Haas, were differences in two areas of the brain. ""The most important finding was that the gray matter volume was greater in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, which is the brain region that serves to evaluate social rewards, in people that tended to be more trusting of others,"" he said. ""Another finding that we observed was for a brain region called the amygdala. The volume of this area of the brain, which codes for emotional saliency, was greater in those that were both most trusting and least trusting of others.

As reported in the journal Neuron, when the researchers corrected these cells  faulty rhythm, either by directly stimulating the cells or by administering low doses of a commonly used drug, cognitive deficits in the mice were reversed, results that point the way to possible therapies to address cognitive symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia. According to Vikaas Sohal, MD, PhD, senior author of the new study, in addition to dealing with the burdens of schizophrenia s so-called positive symptoms (such as delusions and hallucinations) and negative symptoms (such as social withdrawal and a lack of motivation), individuals with the disorder also grapple with cognitive deficits that create considerable challenges in the arenas of education, work, and interpersonal relationships. Converging evidence from many previous studies has implicated a population of neurons in the brain s prefrontal cortex called fast-spiking (FS) interneurons in schizophrenia, but a causal relationship between malfunctioning FS interneurons and cognitive symptoms of the disorder has not yet been firmly established, Sohal said. For example, individuals with schizophrenia perform poorly on the Wisconsin Card-Sorting Test (WSCT), an assessment tool designed more than 60 years ago that sensitively measures the ability to learn new rules on the fly and apply them to complete a task. Electroencephalography ( brain wave ) studies of normal individuals have revealed that gamma oscillations neural activity with a regular rhythm between 30 and 120 cycles per second increase in the front of the brain during cognitive tasks related to the WCST, but  these gamma oscillations are blunted in individuals with schizophrenia,  said Sohal, the Staglin Family-IMHRO Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at UCSF. Because gamma oscillations emerge from the activity of FS interneurons, and because postmortem studies of the brains of individuals with schizophrenia have shown biochemical abnormalities in FS interneurons, many researchers have concluded these neurons must play some role in the cognitive symptoms of the disorder. In the new research, first author and postdoctoral fellow Kathleen K.A. Cho, PhD, led a team that made use of mice developed in the UCSF laboratory of John L.R. Rubenstein, MD, PhD, the Nina Ireland Distinguished Professor in Child Psychiatry. These mice carry only one copy of two genes known as Dlx5 and Dlx6, which govern the proper assembly of FS interneuron circuitry as the brain develops. An intriguing characteristic of these mice is that FS interneurons only become abnormal at a developmental stage corresponding to human post-adolescence, which is when symptoms of schizophrenia usually begin to emerge. In the new research when these mice performed a  rule-shift  task designed to emulate important features of the WCST at a young age, their performance was indistinguishable from that of normal mice. But they showed significant deficits when they performed the task as young adults. To firmly establish that interneuron abnormalities were responsible for this declining performance, the researchers disrupted gamma oscillations in normal adult mice with a technique that allowed them to shine a light into the brain to inhibit the activity of interneurons in the prefrontal cortex, including FS interneurons. These mice performed as poorly on the rule-shift task as those lacking Dlx5 and Dlx6. Conversely, the scientists used a similar technique to restore gamma oscillations by stimulating interneurons in the prefrontal cortex with light in mice lacking Dlx5 and Dlx6, and the mice performed the task as well as normal mice. Finally, when the team gave low doses of clonazepam (Klonopin), which modulates the GABA neurotransmitter system employed by FS interneurons, to mice lacking Dlx5 and Dlx6, the mice again performed the rule-shifting task normally. The cognitive improvements following direct interneuron stimulation persisted for a week after the experiments, suggesting that targeting FS interneuron dysfunction may result in durable improvements in cognitive function in schizophrenia. Clonazepam and other GABA-modulating drugs such as lorazepam (Ativan) and diazepam (Valium) are now used to treat anxiety associated with schizophrenia, but usually at higher doses that also increase sedation, which may mask any cognition-enhancing effect. Lower doses, or better-designed compounds that specifically target FS interneurons in the prefrontal cortex, might be better options, Sohal said, adding that measuring gamma oscillations may be a useful guide in developing these approaches. On a more speculative level, Sohal added, it may be possible to increase gamma oscillations to improve cognition using recently developed, non-invasive brain stimulation technologies such as transcranial magnetic or direct-current stimulation (TMS or tDCS), or even by combining meditation with biofeedback.  Meditation has been shown to potently increase gamma oscillations, and you may be able to teach patients to increase gamma oscillations by themselves,  said Sohal.  Now that we know that gamma oscillations are directly related to cognitive performance, it s certainly an interesting idea to pursue.

In a new paper published in Human Brain Mapping, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)-funded researchers at the University of Cambridge and Medical Research Council's Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit demonstrate that previously reported changes in the aging brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be due to vascular (or blood vessels) changes, rather than changes in neuronal activity itself. Given the large number of fMRI studies used to assess the aging brain, this has important consequences for understanding how the brain changes with age and challenges current theories of aging. A fundamental problem of fMRI is that it measures neural activity indirectly through changes in regional blood flow. Thus, without careful correction for age differences in vasculature reactivity, differences in fMRI signals can be erroneously regarded as neuronal differences. An important line of research focuses on controlling for noise in fMRI signals using additional baseline measures of vascular function. However, such methods have not been widely used, possibly because they are impractical to implement in studies of aging. An alternative candidate for correction makes use of resting state fMRI measurements, which is easy to acquire in most fMRI experiments. While this method has been difficult to validate in the past, the unique combination of an impressive data set across 335 healthy volunteers over the lifespan, as part of the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (CamCAN) project, allowed Dr. Kamen Tsvetanov and colleagues to probe the true nature of aging effects on resting state fMRI signal amplitude. Their research showed that age differences in signal amplitude during a task are of a vascular, not neuronal, origin. They propose that their method can be used as a robust correction factor to control for vascular differences in fMRI studies of aging. The study also challenged previous demonstrations of reduced brain activity in visual and auditory areas during simple sensorimotor tasks. Using conventional methods, the current study replicated these findings. However, after correction, Tsvetanov et al. results show that it might be vascular health, not brain function, that accounts for most age-related differences in fMRI signal in sensory areas. Their results suggest that the age differences in brain activity may be overestimated in previous fMRI studies of aging. Dr. Tsvetanov said: ""There is a need to refine the practice of conducting fMRI. Importantly, this doesn't mean that studies lacking 'golden standard' calibration measures, such as large scale studies, patient studies or ongoing longitudinal studies are invalid. Instead, researchers should make use of available resting state data as a suitable alternative. These findings clearly show that without such correction methods, fMRI studies of the effects of age on cognition may misinterpret effect of age as a cognitive, rather than vascular, phenomena.""

Their research is published in the journal Neuron. The cerebral cortex is the most complex and essential structure of our brain. The nerve cells or neurons that constitute it are the essential elements of its function, and the loss of cortical neurons is the cause of many neurological diseases like stroke, and Alzheimer's. The work of ULB team of researchers led by Pierre Vanderhaeghen, Kimmo Michelsen and Sandra Acosta (WELBIO, IRIBHM and ULB Neuroscience Institute), in collaboration with the laboratory of Afsaneh Gaillard (INSERM/U. Poitiers, France), opens new perspectives for the repair of damaged cell replacement cerebral cortex. The same ULB researchers had previously discovered how to generate in the laboratory cortical neurons from embryonic stem cells. But the question had remained widely open whether these findings could be applied to therapies for brain diseases by cell replacement. This is what the team has now tested successfully. In this study, the researchers tested the therapeutic potential of cortical neurons generated in the laboratory, which were then transplanted into the brains of adult mice who had undergone brain damage resulting in massive neuronal loss in the visual cortex. Remarkably, the researchers found that the transplanted neurons integrated effectively into the brain after injury, but most importantly they could connect with the host brain, as some of them even responded to visual stimuli, like the visual cortex. This approach is still experimental (so far only performed in laboratory mice), and much research is needed before any clinical application in humans. Nevertheless, the success of these experiments combining cell engineering to generate nerve cells in a controlled and unlimited fashion, together with transplantation into damaged brain, opens new avenues to repair the brain following damage or degeneration, such as following stroke or brain trauma.

But sometimes the body makes antibodies that attack healthy cells. In these cases, autoimmune disorders develop. Immune abnormalities in patients with psychosis have been recognized for over a century, but it has been only relatively recently that scientists have identified specific immune mechanisms that seem to directly produce symptoms of psychosis, including hallucinations and delusions. This  immune hypothesis  is supported by new work published by Pathmanandavel and colleagues in the current issue of Biological Psychiatry. They detected antibodies to the dopamine D2 receptor or the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor in a subgroup of children experiencing their first episode of psychosis, but no such antibodies in healthy children. Both are key neural signaling proteins that have previously been implicated in psychosis.  The antibodies we have detected in children having a first episode of acute psychosis suggest there is a distinct subgroup for whom autoimmunity plays a role in their illness,  said Dr. Fabienne Brilot, senior author on the article and Head of the Neuroimmunology Group at The Children's Hospital at Westmead in Sydney. It almost seems like a dirty trick. For decades psychiatrists have administered drugs that stimulate dopamine D2 receptors or block NMDA receptors. These drugs may briefly produce side effects that resemble symptoms of psychotic disorders, including changes in perception, delusions, and disorganization of thought processes. The current findings suggest that people may develop antibodies that affect the brain in ways that are similar to these psychosis-producing drugs.     This study adds fuel to the growing discussions about the importance of antibodies targeting neural proteins and it raises many important questions for the field. Do these antibodies simply function like drugs in the brain or do they  attack  and damage nerve cells in some ways?  questioned Dr. John Krystal, Editor of Biological Psychiatry.  Also, are these antibodies producing symptoms in everyone or do they function as a probe of an underlying, perhaps genetic, vulnerability for psychosis?  Importantly, work is advancing rapidly in this area. Less than a decade ago, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was first identified, a disease characterized by inflammation of the brain that causes acute psychiatric symptoms including psychosis. It is commonly misdiagnosed as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, but is a form of treatable brain inflammation caused by antibodies that attack the brain s NMDA receptors.  The data from this study suggests that better interventions are possible, providing hope that major disability can be prevented for the subset of children experiencing acute psychosis with antibodies,  Brilot added.  These findings also contribute significantly to an emerging acceptance in the field of the involvement of autoimmune antibodies in neurological diseases. Combined, these investigations are providing a better understanding of the biology of psychiatric and neurological diseases, as well as pointing to novel treatment approaches for children with these debilitating illnesses.

Northwestern University scientists now have discovered how a fruit fly's brain represents temperature, mapping it neuron by neuron, which has implications for understanding the much more complex human brain and how it responds to sensory stimuli. ""The brain is a beautiful machine, and one of the new frontiers in biology is to understand how it works,"" said Marco Gallio, who led the research. ""The fruit fly is a fantastic model in which to study how the brain controls behavior, and it can help us understand how sensory circuits work in humans."" Gallio is an assistant professor of neurobiology in Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. In a study of Drosophila melanogaster, Gallio and his team uncovered a coordinated ensemble of neural responses to temperature in the fly's brain. In imaging the fly brain as it responded to hot or cold environments, the researchers found that multiple neural pathways carry from the antennae different types of information about temperature, and the pathways converge in three key areas in the brain. Most neurons respond to either hot or cold, but some trade accuracy for speed. These neurons are good at alerting the animal of a sudden temperature change, but they quickly stop responding and leave the job of reporting how hot or cold it is to different neurons. In a surprise finding, the researchers also learned that a third type of neuron responds to both hot and cold. As both hot and cold temperatures can be quite dangerous to the small fruit fly, this cell type may convey a generic ""danger"" signal associated with temperature change, the researchers said. ""Humans are more resilient than flies in reacting to temperature change,"" Gallio said, ""but the principles we are finding in the fly brain -- the logic and organization -- likely are the same in both. Whether human or fly, the sensory systems have to solve the same problems, so they often do it in the same ways."" The work represents the first comprehensive mapping of the brain circuit that processes temperature information in any animal. The study is published in the journal Nature. ""We decided to focus on temperature as one of the most fundamental sensory modalities,"" Gallio said. ""Much like in the fly antenna, the sensory neurons in our skin respond to either hot or cold temperature. The brain knows what the hand feels by simply keeping track of which cell type is active -- what we call a 'labeled line' system."" In their study, Gallio and his colleagues discovered that the fly brain is able to extract a range of information from the activity of hot and cold neurons. Their results also suggest how the fly can use this information to guide attractive or aversive behaviors. The three types of neurons the researchers identified are: The fruit fly is a great model system in which to study the processing of sensory stimuli, Gallio said. The fly has quite complex behaviors coupled with a genetically and anatomically simpler nervous system than ours. ""We know very little about how neurons communicate in our brain to produce our behavior and emotions, so we study innate responses in model systems such as the fruit fly to understand basic brain functions,"" Gallio said. ""Then we can apply these intellectual tools to understand our brain and how it controls behavior."" Gallio's group is one of only a few in the world that is systematically studying temperature sensing in fruit flies. In earlier work, Gallio identified where hot- and cold-sensing neurons are located on the fly's antenna. He next wanted to know where in the brain these signals from the periphery were sent, which led to the study reported in Nature. In the study, the researchers first used a photolabeling strategy to trace the connections that relay peripheral temperature information to the brain. They found the signals largely converge onto three target regions: the mushroom body and the lateral horn (both well-known centers for sensory processing) and the posterior lateral protocerebrum (now defined as a major site of thermosensory representation). Next, using in vivo calcium imaging, the researchers identified the thermosensory projection neurons activated by either hot or cold stimuli (""narrowly tuned"" neurons) and those that respond to both heating and cooling (""broadly tuned"" neurons). After learning that the neural information took different paths to the brain, Gallio and his team initially were puzzled. ""We found there was an elegant answer,"" Gallio said. ""Some neurons respond to only hot, some neurons respond to only cold, and some neurons respond to both hot and cold. They all converge in the brain, where all the messages are orchestrated into a cohesive response."" Northwestern University   Original reporting by: Megan Fellman Dominic D. Frank, Genevieve C.

The CytoSMART  Technology enables researchers to take time-lapse videos and images of their cell culture. The images taken with the CytoSMART  Device are transmitted to CytoSMART  Cloud, which permits researchers to view their cell culture outside the lab at any time.  Possible applications of the CytoSMART  Technology are broad, including using video to document the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells, and migration assays such as scratch assays. The system also lends itself to the monitoring of cell cultures under hypoxic conditions, as well as easy and efficient cell culture standardization.  The CytoSMART  Technology is an excellent addition to our existing research portfolio, in particular, our primary cell offering. While elaborate live cell imaging systems have been available to the market for years, solutions that are affordable and easy-to-use have been missing until now. We are convinced that, thanks to CytoSMART , almost any lab can take advantage of the numerous possibilities that live cell culture imaging offers,  said Teun van der Heide, Head of Lonza s Bioscience Solutions business unit.  Joffry Maltha, CEO of CytoMate Technologies BV, commented:  During our own research, we came to understand that there was a need for a system that could offer permanent cell culture monitoring. Just as importantly, it needed to be small, simple to use, affordable for general labs to purchase and able to free researchers from the burden of manually checking their cells on a frequent basis. With our years of experience in the electronics industry, we decided to address the issue and develop a system similar to current smartphone technologies, resulting in the CytoSMART  offerings. With Lonza, we have found the ideal global distribution partner, which will allow us to gain rapid market access through its existing sales, marketing and distribution channels.

The article, entitled  The role of NGS in stratified cancer medicine , presents a valuable resource to better understand the present and the future of NGS in stratified cancer medicine, detailing the most relevant aspects of this revolutionary technology.  A key focus of current cancer research is developing the use of stratified medicine. The approach is highly advantageous in guiding effective therapy as it profiles the genetic makeup of individual tumour samples. Revealing insights into why NGS is becoming ever more popular for this very purpose, NHS Clinical Scientists Dr George Burghel and Dr Matthew Smith discuss its primary strengths and the challenges faced, as well as important factors to consider for its application. The role of this rapidly evolving technology in realising stratified cancer medicine depends on many aspects, and this account of how it is currently being applied presents a valuable update for the molecular pathology community on the most effective application of NGS.     The article explains how targeted sequencing panels meet the high-throughput needs and cost considerations for the clinical research laboratory, and how content for such panels is carefully chosen and tested, while also evolving alongside the latest genomic discoveries. Library preparation methods are a key consideration for targeted sequencing, and readers can also discover the pros and cons of amplicon and hybridisation techniques, based on first-hand experience. As Dr Burghel and Dr Smith also explain, in addition to enhancing the technology itself, it is important to consider logistical aspects of integrating NGS in the clinical research setting, which demands stringent quality control and compatibility with FFPE samples.    The introduction of high-throughput NGS methods is revolutionising cancer genomics research, which is rapidly moving from single-gene mutation analysis to cancer genomic profiling,  comments Dr Burghel on the current utility of NGS. Based on its present success, the future of NGS is sure to prove a key driver of stratified medicine, as Dr Smith supports:  Along with existing and emerging testing strategies, NGS has an extremely important role to play in future cancer characterisation and treatment.

Flu-like illness can be caused by many pathogens, making it difficult to assess how often people are infected by influenza. Researchers analyzed blood samples from volunteers in Southern China, looking at antibody levels against nine different influenza strains that circulated from 1968 to 2009. They found that while children get flu on average every other year, flu infections become less frequent as people progress through childhood and early adulthood. From the age of 30 onwards, flu infections tend to occur at a steady rate of about two per decade. Dr Adam Kucharski, who worked on the study at Imperial College London before moving to the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: ""There's a lot of debate in the field as to how often people get flu, as opposed to flu-like illness caused by something else. These symptoms could sometimes be caused by common cold viruses, such as rhinovirus or coronavirus. Also, some people might not realize they had flu, but the infection will show up when a blood sample is subsequently tested. This is the first time anyone has reconstructed a group's history of infection from modern-day blood samples."" Dr Steven Riley, senior author of the study, from the Medical Research Council Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling at Imperial, said: ""For adults, we found that influenza infection is actually much less common than some people think. In childhood and adolescence, it's much more common, possibly because we mix more with other people. The exact frequency of infection will vary depending on background levels of flu and vaccination."" In addition to estimating the frequency of flu infection, the researchers, from the UK, the US and China, developed a mathematical model of how our immunity to flu changes over a lifetime as we encounter different strains of the virus. The immune system responds to flu viruses by producing antibodies that specifically target proteins on the virus surface. These proteins can change as the virus evolves, but we keep antibodies in the blood that have a memory for strains we've encountered before. The model supported evidence from other studies that the strains of influenza virus we encounter earlier in life evoke stronger immune responses than those we meet later. The findings will help take into account the effect of immunity in the population on the evolution of flu viruses, and potentially make predictions about how the virus will change in the future. They could also help scientists consider how immunity to historical strains will influence the way vaccines work and how effective they will be. Dr Kucharski said: ""What we've done in this study is to analyze how a person's immunity builds up over a lifetime of flu infections. This information helps us understand the susceptibility of the population as a whole and how easy it is for new seasonal strains to spread through the population."" The findings are published in PLOS Biology.

The library will cover thousands of chemical substances, allowing users of SCIEX TripleTOF  6600 mass spectrometers for forensic testing to more effectively and efficiently develop and validate new analytical methods for forensic compound screening. The reference library generated by this collaboration will ultimately allow forensic scientists to identify and analyse unknown substances or toxins, including pharmacological agents or forensic drugs in samples more easily, accurately and with more confidence. The generation of the hybrid Quadrupole TOF library of chemical substances used in conjunction with mass spectrometry techniques is particularly important for applications in forensic toxicology. Forensic samples may contain unknown substances that a person may have ingested up to several weeks prior to the sample being taken. Therefore, forensic testing requires a precise, sensitive and robust approach to sample analysis. Labor Berlin will provide the pharmacological input to the collaboration and SCIEX, a global leader in life science analytical technologies, will assemble the hybrid Quadrupole TOF library using its expertise and highly robust and reliable instrumentation.  These library databases offer benefits to forensic testing scientists to enable them to detect the latest emerging novel psychoactive substances, and their metabolites, to enhance their forensic discovery screening workflows,  said Vincent Paez, Sr. Director, Food, Environmental and Forensics Testing at SCIEX. A key feature of the library database is the inclusion of spectra collected in authenticated samples, providing relevant metabolite spectral information which is difficult to discover by other means.  We chose to collaborate with SCIEX because it is a manufacturer of superior analytical products, and the collaboration with Labor Berlin will make it possible to generate methods for almost any substance,  said Dr. Torsten Binscheck-Doma , Head of the Clinical and Forensic Toxicology Department at Labor Berlin.

The technology, which relies on data from human cells grown in the laboratory, could result in a large reduction in the number of live animals used in toxicology studies. There are limited approaches for analyzing the specific interactions that occur between the proteins of our cells and the thousands of chemicals that are in everyday use. The relationships between these interactions and the adverse effects that may arise are also often poorly understood. The ChemInteract consortium will build on existing laboratory techniques that are successfully used in pharmaceutical discovery to identify how a drug interacts with a living cell; extending the technology to identify crucial interactions between chemicals and human proteins that could indicate a potential safety concern. The consortium will use complex bioinformatics when developing the tool, to assess the likelihood that the chemical-protein interactions discovered will cause unwanted effects in humans or other animals. Hundreds of human proteins that are often implicated in adverse effects will be incorporated, with the ultimate aim of providing the chemical industry with a rapid and safe method for identifying and understanding potential toxicological issues. This would help 'bad' chemicals to be discarded at an early stage, avoiding unnecessary animal testing. Proof-of-concept funding for the initial phase of development work has been awarded by the UK-based National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) as part of the CRACK IT Targeting Off-targets Challenge competition. The consortium is led by Phenotox, a company specializing in developing animal-free toxicology approaches. Phenotox founder and expert toxicologist Dr James Sidaway said: ""There s a real gap in predicting the adverse events in humans of new chemicals developed by the pharmaceutical, consumer healthcare and agrochemical industries. This is partly because the full set of protein targets that mediate chemical toxicities has not been discovered. Current safety testing approaches rely heavily on animal studies which do not fully represent the human situation. Our animal-free approach builds on advanced, but established, experimental technology from Retrogenix and Sheffield Hallam University and existing big data and bioinformatics expertise from Instem.

Many women face a higher risk of breast cancer due to the presence of BRCA gene mutations. A BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carrier has approximately a 50 percent risk of developing breast cancer before the age of 50, and the cancer can develop within months of a negative screening by mammography. The risk is so significant that many women with BRCA mutations undergo prophylactic, or preventive mastectomies to avoid getting invasive cancer later in life. For the new study, researchers assessed 2-D localized correlated spectroscopy (L-COSY) as a noninvasive means to identify biochemical changes associated with a very early stage of cancer development known as the pre-invasive state. The researchers performed L-COSY on nine women carrying the BRCA1 and 14 women with BRCA2 gene mutations and compared the results with those from 10 healthy controls who had no family history of breast cancer. All the patients underwent contrast enhanced 3-T MRI and ultrasound. While no abnormality was recorded by MRI or ultrasound, L-COSY MRS identified statistically significant biochemical changes in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations compared to controls. The researchers found multiple distinct cellular changes measurable through L-COSY indicative of premalignant changes in women carrying BRCA gene mutations. ""These changes appear to represent a series of early warning signs that may allow women to make informed decisions as to when and if they have prophylactic mastectomy,"" said Carolyn Mountford, M.Sc., D.Phil., from the University of Newcastle in Callaghan, Australia, Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and the Translational Research Institute in Brisbane. Study co-author David Clark, M.B.B.S., B.Sc., F.R.A.C.S., from the Breast and Endocrine Centre in Gateshead, New South Wales, Australia, believes the protocol may help guide treatment decisions in women with BRCA mutations. Dr. Clark noted that approximately half the women who have BRCA mutations may not develop breast cancer at all and certainly not before they turn 50 years old, so the spectroscopy technique could be extremely useful. ""We think there are three stages of pre-cancer progression in the breast tissue,"" he said. ""Women at Stage 1 could monitor their breasts with follow-up spectroscopy every six months."" The research team also found evidence that lipid pathways are affected differently in the two different gene mutations, which may help explain why BRCA2 mutation carriers survive longer than BRCA1 carriers. The study represents the culmination of more than 25 years of work, according to Dr. Mountford. Research on biopsy samples in the 1980s proved the existence of pre-invasive states, but technological improvements were needed before the technique could be applied to clinical MRI scanners. ""It took a multidisciplinary team, including an MR physicist, chemists, radiographers and radiologists to be sure that what we were seeing was not apparent from conventional contrast-enhanced imaging,"" Dr. Mountford said. The researchers hope to confirm the findings in larger populations and continue to monitor the women in the study group with the 2-D L-COSY protocol to learn more about the biochemical changes and what they represent.","Published: March 5, 2015"

This phenomenon, called multidrug resistance, leads to tumors that defy treatment. Now scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have published a pair of studies showing how the primary protein responsible for multidrug chemotherapy resistance changes shape and reacts to therapeutic drugs.  This information will help us design better molecules to inhibit or evade multidrug resistance,  said TSRI Associate Professor Qinghai Zhang, a senior author of both studies. The findings were published recently in two papers: a study in the journal Structure co-led by Bridget Carragher, a professor at TSRI with a joint appointment at the New York Structural Biology Center, and a paper in Acta Crystallographica Section D co-led by Geoffrey Chang, professor in the UC San Diego Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. How a Protein Causes Multidrug Resistance The proteins at work in multidrug resistance are V-shaped proteins called ABC transporters. ABC transporters are found in all kingdoms of life-from bacteria to humans. In humans, an important ABC transporter is P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which catches harmful toxins in a  binding pocket  and expels them from cells. The problem is that in cancer patients, P-gp sometimes begins recognizing chemotherapy drugs and expelling them, too. Over time, more and more cancer cells can develop multidrug resistance, eliminating all possible treatments.  Virtually all cancer deaths can be attributed to the failure of chemotherapy,  said Zhang. To design more effective cancer drugs, scientists would benefit from a better understanding of P-gp and how it binds to molecules. A Better Look at Transporters For the new Structure study, researchers looked at P-gp under one of TSRI s powerful electron microscopes. They also looked at MsbA, a similar transporter protein found in bacteria. The electron microscopy (EM) work-spearheaded by a postdoctoral researcher, Arne Moeller, working in the laboratory of Carragher and former TSRI Professor Clint Potter, co-directors of the National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy-solved a major problem in transporter research. Until recently, researchers could only compare images of crystal structures made from transporter proteins. These crystallography images showed single snapshots of the transporter but didn t show how the shape of the transporters could change. Using EM, however, a whole range of different conformations of the structures could be visualized, essentially capturing P-pg and MsbA in action. The new research was also enabled by the development of new chemical tools. Previous studies were hampered by the fact that outside the cell membranes these transporter proteins turned into an unstructured mash.  They looked like tofu,  said Sung Chang Lee, a research associate in Zhang s lab at TSRI and co-first author of the Structure study. In the study, the researchers used a solution of lipids and peptides to mimic natural conditions in the cell membrane. A novel chemical called beta sheet peptide, developed by the Zhang lab, was used to stabilize the protein and provide enough stability for a new perspective. Together with EM, this technique enabled the research team to capture a series of images showing how transporter proteins change shape in response to drug and nucleotide binding. They found that transporter proteins have an open binding pocket that constantly switches to face different sides of membranes.  The transporter goes through many steps-it s like a machine,  said Zhang. A Closer Look at Binding In the second study, the researchers investigated the drug binding sites of P-gp using higher-resolution X-ray crystallography. Their findings, published in Acta Crystallographica Section D, show how P-gp interacts with drug-like molecules called ligands. The researchers studied crystals of the transporter bound to four different ligands to see how the transporters reacted. The researchers found that when certain ligands bind to P-gp, they trigger local conformational changes in the transporter. Binding also increased the rate of ATP hydrolysis, which provides mechanical energy and may be the first step in the binding pocket closing process. The team also found that ligands could bind to different areas of the transporter, leaving nearby slots open for other molecules. This suggested that it may be difficult to completely halt the drug expulsion process. Zhang said the next step in this research is to develop molecules to evade P-gp binding. In addition to Zhang, Carragher, Potter, Lee and Moeller, authors of the Structure paper,  Distinct Conformational Spectrum of Homologous Multidrug ABC Transporters,  were Houchao Tao and Jeffrey A. Speir of TSRI; Chang of UC San Diego; and Ina L. Urbatsch of Texas Tech University.","Published: March 5, 2015"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/labonpaper-invented-199335,Lab On Paper Invented New paper based platform for conducting a wide range of complex medical diagnostics  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A team of University of Rhode Island engineers led by Professor Mohammad Faghri has created a new paper-based platform for conducting a wide range of complex medical diagnostics. The key development was the invention of fluid actuated valves embedded in the paper that allow for sequential manipulation of sample fluids and multiple reagents in a controlled manner to perform complex multi-step immune-detection tests without human intervention. Faghri said that the platform technology can potentially be applied to a wide variety of medical diagnostics, from Lyme disease and HIV to Ebola and malaria.  If someone comes up with a new biomarker for detecting a disease, we can create a test for it using our platform,  he said. He also envisions applications in the veterinary medicine field, as well as for the detection of environmental contaminants and biological or chemical threats.  It could even be used at airports to test fluids for possible bioterror agents,  he added. A number of companies have already expressed interest in adapting various applications to the new platform. A strong patent with broad claims has been issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for this technology, and two more are pending. According to Faghri, paper-based lateral flow test strips, such as for pregnancy tests, have been commercially successful for many years. In these devices, a sample fluid wicks along a strip of paper, reacts with embedded reagents, and produces a colored signal result. However, more complex medical diagnostics such as enzymatic assay protocols require multiple reagents triggered at particular times during the process, which can only be accomplished autonomously using the proprietary microfluidic valve technology created by the URI research team.  We combined the well-established test strip technology, micro-patterning techniques and our innovative paper-based valves to create a new class of strip tests that are capable of autonomously handling multiple reagents,  explained Faghri.  The sample fluid activates the flow of reagents in a predetermined sequence and time. When combined with an optical reader, which could even be a conventional smart phone, the lab-on-paper device provides accurate quantitative results.  We re the only research group in the world to have created fluidic valves on multi-layered paper without the use of external mechanical, electric or magnetic force and to use these valves to create fluidic circuits similar to electrical circuits,"" he added. The lab-on-paper devices are constructed with multiple layers of paper printed with wax to create a three-dimensional structure of valves and channels along which the fluid travels, triggering the reagents at the appropriate time and generating a result. This new paper-based technology is the next generation of the lab-on-a-chip device the research team reported in 2011, which has been further refined since then. That device is now smaller and employs an innovative micropump for precise fluid movement within the cartridge s microchannels.  Our new paper-based system, however, doesn t need any pumping because the fluid flows naturally along the paper channels via wicking,  said Faghri.  It can perform enzymatic assays on paper autonomously with sensitivities close to laboratory techniques.  Faghri and collaborator Constantine Anagnostopoulos, a URI adjunct professor of mechanical engineering, established a start-up company, Labonachip LLC, to commercialize their technologies. Anagnostopoulos serves as the company s president.  Our next step is to find investors to help take us to the next level,  said Anagnostopoulos.  We re looking to partner with medical or biological companies that have identified disease biomarkers or other molecules of interest for which we could develop tests for using our platform.  The researchers have already succeeded in performing a feasibility study of their technology by detecting a biomarker for sepsis, a life-threatening complication from an infection. ProThera Biologics, a Providence-based company co-founded by Brown University Professor Yow-Pin Lim, identified a biomarker that indicates a patient is going into shock from sepsis, and the company has collaborated with Faghri and Anagnostopoulos to develop a paper-based rapid test using this biomarker.  The technology is a significant improvement over the simple conventional lateral flow strip, as it can perform complex tests that require multiple steps and reagents,  said Lim.  It is exciting that this technology enables an accurate measurement of analytes such as our sepsis biomarker without costly laboratory equipment and trained personnel.  The researchers are working with the University of Rhode Island Research Foundation to identify potential partners.  A number of diagnostics companies are currently evaluating this lab-on-paper microfluidics technology as the industry moves from lab-based testing to point-of-care rapid, autonomous diagnostics,  said Gerald Sonnenfeld, chairman of the URI Research Foundation and URI s vice president of research and economic development.  We expect the point-of-care testing market to expand greatly over the next several years. ","Published: March 5, 2015"

Appearing in journal Neuron, the paper upends conventional thinking about the effects of Alzheimer's-associated mutations in the presenilin genes and provides an explanation for the failure of drugs designed to block presenilin activity. ""Our study provides new insights into Alzheimer's disease by showing how human mutations that cause the disease lead to neurodegeneration and dementia,"" says Raymond J. Kelleher III, MD, PhD, of the MGH Department of Neurology and Center for Human Genetic Research, co-senior author of the paper. ""We found that mutations in the presenilin-1 gene promote the hallmark features of the disease by decreasing, rather than increasing, function of the presenilin-1 protein and the gamma-secretase enzyme. In addition to the important therapeutic implications of our findings, we have also generated the first animal model in which an Alzheimer's-disease-causing mutation produces neurodegeneration in the cerebral cortex."" While inherited or familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is very rare, accounting for only around 1 percent of cases, the identification more than 20 years ago of the genes that cause FAD provided the first clues into the mechanism behind the effects of the disease. The rarest FAD-associated mutations are found in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is clipped by multiple proteases to produce the beta-amyloid peptides that accumulate into the amyloid plaques characteristic of the disease. Mutations in two presenilin genes - which encode essential components of gamma secretase, one of the proteases that process APP - account for around 90 percent of FAD cases. Individuals with presenilin-associated FAD develop Alzheimer's symptoms even earlier than do those with APP mutations. While the mechanism by which presenilin mutations cause neurodegeneration has not been known, the general thinking was that they increase presenilin and gamma secretase activity, resulting in overproduction of beta-amyloid and particularly of beta-amyloid 42, which is thought to be more prone to deposition in plaques. As a result, development of gamma secretase inhibitors has been a major therapeutic effort pursued by pharmaceutical companies. But Jie Shen, PhD, of the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at BWH, co-senior author of the Neuron paper, questioned this widely held view and the use of gamma secretase inhibitors to treat of Alzheimer's disease because her earlier investigations into the normal function of the presenilin genes showed that genetically suppressing presenilin and gamma secretase activity in adult mice caused Alzheimer's-like neurodegeneration, results that contrasted with those of studies in which the overproduction of beta-amyloid or presenilins failed to produce neurodegeneration. In a 2007 paper published in PNAS, Shen and Kelleher - who had been treating FAD patients with mutations in the presenilin-1 gene and researching brain mechanisms underlying cognitive function - proposed what they termed the presenilin hypothesis: that a loss of presenilin function may be the primary event triggering neurodegeneration and dementia in FAD. In recent studies, Kelleher identified a novel FAD-causing presenilin-1 mutation that inactivated its function in a sensitive cell culture system. In collaboration with Shen, his group went on to show that a series of FAD mutations all impaired presenilin-1 function in cell culture. These findings raised the pivotal question of how such mutations affected presenilin-1 function in living animals, especially in the brain. While Shen's earlier investigations had used strains of mice in which one or more copies of the presenilin genes were totally inactivated, for this study she and Kelleher generated mice in which specific, FAD-associated presenilin-1 mutations were ""knocked in"" to the gene, causing them to be expressed just as they are in human patients with that particular mutation. One of the mutations they tested is relatively common among FAD patients, while the other is fairly rare; and both are located near the site where the protein interacts with its target molecules, when incorporated into gamma secretase. As was the case with animals in which both copies of presenilin-1 were deleted in earlier studies, those in which both copies were mutated did not survive after birth. Mice in which a single presenilin-1 gene was mutated survived, but showed deficiencies in learning and memory compared with control mice. Production of beta-amyloid within the brains of these mice was actually reduced, although the ratio between forms of the peptide was changed, with proportionally more plaque-associated beta-amyloid 42 being generated. Closer examination of the brains of mice with the FAD mutation showed the same sort of synaptic dysfunction and age-associated neurodegeneration seen in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. ""This paper clearly shows that these FAD mutations cause a loss of presenilin function and gamma secretase activity, leading to the loss of neurons in the adult brain,"" says Shen. ""The most important implication of our findings is that strategies that enhance rather than inhibit gamma secretase should be investigated as potential Alzheimer's therapies. They also may explain why a major clinical trial of a gamma secretase inhibitor failed to help patients and actually worsened their cognitive abilities."" She adds that their presenilin hypothesis does not rule out a role for beta-amyloid in Alzheimer's pathology, it just places presenilin/gamma secretase activity closer to the pathway that leads to neurodegeneration. While this study only examined presenilin-1 mutations, Kelleher notes, the researchers believe that loss of function is a general property of FAD mutations in both presenilin genes. Investigation of the mechanisms underlying the effects of the APP mutations is also warranted, as is examination of how presenilin dysfunction may contribute to the common, late-onset form of Alzheimer's disease. ""Shared or convergent molecular pathways may be responsible for pathogenesis in both familial and sporadic forms, and we hope that mechanistic relationships will become clearer with the identification of genetic risk factors for sporadic or late-onset Alzheimer's disease,"" he says. ""We're now actively pursuing strategies to develop candidate therapies that restore presenilin-1 function. We also hope that our knockin mouse model will facilitate development and preclinical testing of these and other agents that can combat neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.""

The variant occurs almost twice as often among women with multiple sclerosis as in women without the disease, making it ""one of the strongest genetic risk factors for MS discovered to date,"" said senior author Doug Feinstein, professor of anesthesiology at UIC and research biologist at the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center. The report is published in the journal ASN NEURO. Feinstein and his colleagues were able to test three sisters among a group of five siblings between the ages of 23 and 26, all diagnosed with MS. They found the variant in all three they tested. What they found was a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, in a gene called STK11, which plays a role in tumor suppression and is believed to have several roles in brain function. MS affects approximately 2.5 million people worldwide, causing damage to the myelin sheath of neurons. Loss of myelin interferes with the transmission of signals along the nerve fibers and impairs motor function, including walking and speech. Symptoms, which can be sporadic or progressive, range from mild to debilitating. Genetic factors are known to influence the risk of developing MS. The UIC researchers were led to this variant thanks to a woman participating in another study at UIC. In a casual conversation, the woman told study coordinator Anne Boullerne that she and her four siblings -- three sisters, including twins, and a brother -- all had multiple sclerosis. ""This is an extremely rare occurrence,"" said Boullerne, who is research assistant professor of anesthesiology and lead author on the paper. She said she could find no published studies with five siblings with multiple sclerosis. ""I was immediately interested in the possibility of a genetic study of the family because all five siblings -- an entire generation -- are affected by MS, and so we could have a very good chance of discovering key genes related to inheritance of the disease."" The woman also described among her sisters and the women on her mother's side of the family a prevalence of diseases associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the STK11 gene and characterized by an increased risk for certain cancers, including breast, ovary and colon cancers. A literature search by Feinstein uncovered an article that described how mice with a disabled STK11 gene had a higher incidence of loss of myelin from the nerves of the central nervous system -- a defining characteristic of MS. The woman consented to a complete DNA-sequencing of her genome. Boullerne took a close look at the STK11 gene, where she discovered the SNP. She next obtained consent to sequence the genomes of two of the woman's sisters and found they also carried the same SNP. To determine if the SNP could be a contributing factor to the siblings' multiple sclerosis, the researchers screened DNA samples from 1,400 people -- 750 with MS and 650 without -- provided by Jorge Oksenberg at the University of California, San Francisco, who is a leading expert on the genetics of MS. They found that the SNP was 1.7 times as prevalent in women with MS as in women without the disease, making it one of the highest known genetic risk factors for MS. Based on their analysis, the researchers estimate that the STK11 SNP is present in about 7 percent of the general population. But because far fewer people develop MS, other genetic or non-genetic factors must play a role in the development of the disease, Feinstein said. Feinstein and Boullerne plan to continue their hunt for other genetic factors that may contribute to MS among the five siblings and possibly their parents. They will also investigate the function of the STK11 gene in the lab, which could reveal molecular pathways involved in multiple sclerosis.

The results were surprising because mental health more closely correlated with disability than assessments typically made after concussions, such as tests of memory, thinking, balance, coordination and severity of headaches and dizziness, according to the study led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. ""Symptoms of post-traumatic stress and depression have always been thought to develop months to years later,"" said David L. Brody, MD, PhD, associate professor of neurology at Washington University. ""We don't know what causes these symptoms, whether they result from the brain injury itself, from the stress of war or some combination of factors. But regardless of their origin, the severity of these psychological symptoms soon after injury was the strongest predictor of later disability."" Appearing in the journal Brain, the study also suggests that mild concussions have more severe long-term effects than previously thought, including difficulty returning to previous work, family and social activities. The results raise questions about how best to treat U.S. troops who suffer head injuries. During the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, about one-fifth of service members experienced a head injury, according to recent estimates from the U.S. Department of Defense, and more than 80 percent of those were considered mild. ""I was surprised by how severe the level of disability was 6-12 months after these seemingly mild injuries, especially given that virtually all of these patients returned to duty soon after their concussions,"" said Brody, the study's senior author. According to the investigators, the study is the first to evaluate active-duty service members with blast-related mild concussions very early, in the first week after injury, and to combine that with follow-up evaluations of the same patients 6-12 months later. Most studies of traumatic brain injury in military personnel have focused on those injured severely enough to be evacuated from war zones. In partnership with the U.S. military, investigators at Washington University in St. Louis and the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth in Virginia evaluated traumatic brain injury from blast exposure in active-duty military personnel stationed in Afghanistan in 2012. The study included 38 patients diagnosed with mild blast-related brain injury and 34 service members without brain injury who volunteered to serve as controls. Those in the study ranged in age from 19-44, with a median age of 26 in the study group and 28 in the control group. Early assessments of service members were made in Afghanistan within the first week after injury. To evaluate mental health, the investigators used a standard military questionnaire for assessing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, such as experiencing repeated, disturbing memories or dreams, feelings of emotional numbness, difficulty concentrating and feelings of anger or hyper-alertness. Follow-up mental health assessments were conducted with standard interviews 6-12 months later. At the later evaluations performed at Washington University in St. Louis, 63 percent of patients in the brain injury group were classified as moderately disabled, compared with 20 percent of the control group. Patients were classified as moderately disabled if they were unable to work as they did before injury; unable to continue previous social and leisure activities; or had mental health problems that disrupted relationships with family and friends. The remaining 37 percent of the brain injury group were considered to have a good recovery. ""When we were able to connect the dots, we saw that injuries that might have been considered trivial seemed to have a big impact on how these patients did later on,"" said first author Christine L. MacDonald, PhD, who conducted the study while at Washington University. She is now at the University of Washington in Seattle. This result was unexpected, according to the investigators, because the vast majority of past research on traumatic brain injury in military personnel and civilians has focused on cognitive function and physical symptoms such as headaches. ""Most previous studies have hypothesized that things such as duration of loss of consciousness, duration of post-traumatic amnesia and how well patients could perform tasks of thinking, memory, attention, balance and coordination would be the predictors of later disability,"" Brody said. ""We looked at these factors. And they were not strongly correlated with how well patients did long term."" MacDonald said the findings suggest that care for brain injuries among military personnel should be broadened to include psychological evaluations earlier in the process. Similar to the decision criteria for civilians returning to sports, school or work after concussions, the criteria used to determine whether a service member should return to active duty now are focused on cognitive function and clinical symptoms and do not include assessments of mental health. ""We hope to contribute to the discussion about what should be done for these patients when they come in with seemingly mild concussions,"" MacDonald said. ""We need to investigate whether there are new approaches to early care that will improve their quality of life over the long term."" Brody and MacDonald credit a partnership with the study's principal investigator in Afghanistan, Lt. Cmdr. Octavian Adam, MD, of the U.S. Navy, for making this study possible. Adam is a neurologist at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth and was deployed to provide care for U.S. troops. ""We wouldn't have been able to do the study if Lt. Cmdr. Adam hadn't reached out to us to collaborate,"" MacDonald said. ""The logistical complexities of conducting a study in an active war zone were extraordinary."" As such, Brody and his colleagues are planning a similar study of civilian concussions, looking at mental health measures immediately following mild head injuries in patients who come to the emergency room. Those patients will be followed to determine long-term outcomes. ""The lessons that we learn from military trauma apply quite readily to civilian trauma,"" Brody said. ""Still, there may be unique aspects of military brain injury that are not true in the civilian world. It could also be that this is a general phenomenon that has not been carefully addressed in civilian or military populations.""

Researchers found that obesity was associated with significantly lowered number of opioid receptors in the brain. However, no changes were observed in the dopamine neurotransmitter system, which regulates motivational aspects of eating. Obesity is a great challenge to human health worldwide because it is associated with serious medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Even though it is well known that unhealthy eating habits are the major cause for obesity, people have often problems with restraining their eating.   The findings, published in The Journal of Neuroscience, highlight how obesity is associated with brain-level molecular changes. It is possible that the lack of brain s opioid receptors predisposes the obese individuals to overeating to compensate decreased hedonic responses in this system, say professor Lauri Nummenmaa and researcher Henry Karlsson. The findings have major implications for understanding the causes of obesity and the mechanisms involved in overeating, and provide insight into behavioral and pharmacological treatment and prevention of obesity. However, it is not yet known whether the altered brain neurochemistry is a cause or consequence of obesity.

Published in the Journal of Neuroscience, the findings illustrate structural and functional connections that allow the brain to use reinforcement learning to make spatial decisions, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Communication between these regions is important for abilities like how a baseball player is able to estimate where to swing his bat or how a person finds a car in a large parking lot filled with similar cars. Knowing how these specific pathways work together provides crucial insight into how learning occurs. It also could lead to improved treatments for Parkinson's disease. ""By understanding precisely how these systems communicate together, we can come up with a better understanding for how these systems operate in the healthy brain, but also start to understand how in Parkinson's disease different types of systems 'cascade,' or start with one symptom like motor dysfunction and move to another like memory or decision-making problems,"" said Timothy Verstynen, assistant professor of psychology and a faculty member in the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC) in CMU's Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. The hope is that more knowledge of how the connectivity is related to behavior will help scientists develop therapeutic interventions that focus on strengthening potentially weakened or damaged pathways. For the study, Verstynen and Kevin Jarbo, a Ph.D. student in psychology, used diffusion spectrum imaging and fiber technology to analyze brain images collected from 60 healthy adults. The advanced imaging techniques allowed Verstynen and Jarbo to visualize the white matter pathways from the DLPFC, OFC and PPC. They found that the pathways from all three areas projected to similar areas within a forebrain region called striatum, a part of the basal ganglia pathways that are most commonly associated with Parkinson's disease. The patterns were consistent across all participants. The researchers followed the structural connectivity analysis with a functional connectivity analysis by using resting state fMRI images. The results showed that the convergence zones were not only structurally connected but functionally connected as well. More importantly, the areas at the surface of the brain in all three cortical areas showed a high overlap of structure and functional connectivity. ""Our findings suggest that there may be a structural and functional network in the brain that allows us to integrate information about where we are focusing our attention in our visuospatial environment with reward and punishment signals associated with our past action choices in order to learn how to update, and hopefully improve, our future action decisions,"" Jarbo said. An additional implication for this study is a deeper understanding of how reinforcement learning occurs. ""A lot of models of the reinforcement learning process assume that reward signals from the orbitofrontal cortex converge with information from other areas. These have been shown to be true for other regions of the prefrontal cortex. We are the first to show that spatial attention information from the parietal cortex may also contribute to this process,"" Verstynen said.

Assessing a breast cancer s pattern of activity in these stem cell genes has the potential to identify women who might need intensive treatment to prevent their disease recurring or spreading, the researchers said.  Adult stem cells are healthy cells within the body which have not specialised into any particular type, and so retain the ability to keep on dividing and replacing worn out cells in parts of the body such as the gut, skin or breast.  A research team from The Institute of Cancer Research, London, King s College London and Cardiff University s European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute identified a set of 323 genes whose activity was turned up to high levels in normal breast stem cells in mice. The study is published today in the open access journal Breast Cancer Research, and was funded by a range of organisations including the Medical Research Council, the ICR, Breakthrough Breast Cancer and Cancer Research UK.  The scientists cross-referenced their panel of normal stem cell genes against the genetic profiles of tumours from 579 women with triple-negative breast cancer   a form of the disease which is particularly difficult to treat.  They split the tumour samples into two categories based on their  score  for the activity of the stem cell genes.  Women with triple-negative tumours in the highest-scoring category were much less likely to stay free of breast cancer than those with the lowest-scoring tumours. Women with tumours from the higher-scoring group had around a 10 per cent chance of avoiding relapse after 10 years, while women from the low-scoring group had a chance of around 60 per cent of avoiding relapse.  The results show that the cells of aggressive triple-negative breast cancers are particularly  stem-cell-like , taking on properties of stem cells such as self-renewal to help them grow and spread. They also suggest that some of the 323 genes could be promising targets for potential cancer drugs.  Study leader Dr Matthew Smalley, Deputy Director of the European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute and Reader within Cardiff University s School of Biosciences, said:  Triple negative breast cancer accounts for around 15 per cent of breast cancers, but is more difficult to treat than other cancer types as it is not suitable for treatments such as anti-hormonal therapy. It s particularly important to understand the genetic factors that help it to spread around the body   and we were excited to find that a key factor seems to be the degree to which gene activity resembles that of stem cells.   Although our work is not yet ready for clinical use, our next step will be to explore which of these 323 genes are the most important drivers of the disease and to use these to develop a new genetic test.  Study co-author Professor Clare Isacke, Professor of Molecular Cell Biology at the ICR, said:  Cancer cells can behave very much like stem cells   but stem cells gone bad. They find a way to activate genes which are usually only turned up in normal stem cells, giving them characteristics   such as self-renewal and immortality   that make them more difficult to treat.   Our study could ultimately help lead to a genetic test assessing breast cancer cells for how closely they resemble stem cells. Picking out women with this type of aggressive disease could give us new ways of personalising treatment.  Dr Matthew Lam, Senior Research Officer at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said:  Women with triple negative breast cancer tend to have higher rates of recurrence than those with other types of breast cancer.   There is so much more to learn about this particularly aggressive form of the disease which is why this type of research is so important. If we can develop ways to predict who is most likely to relapse, more can be done to protect high-risk patients, such as closer monitoring or extended treatment, to help reduce the chance of their cancer coming back.  Dr Nathan Richardson, Head of Molecular and Cellular Medicine at the Medical Research Council, said:  Triple negative breast cancers are a particularly challenging form of the disease to treat. Casting a light on to the genetic factors that are behind the recurrence and spread of cancer is crucial to understanding more about the biology of this aggressive disease.   This study could be hugely important to find ways to identify those patients who are at risk of the most aggressive forms of the disease, improving the way they are monitored and cared for. Crucially, this research could lead to new treatments with the potential to make a real difference for women with this type of breast cancer. ","Published: March 4, 2015"

Specifically, the research shows that although we inherit equal amounts of genetic mutations from our parents   the mutations that make us who we are instead of some other person   we actually  use  more of the DNA that we inherit from our dads. The research, published in the journal Nature Genetics, has wide implications for the study of human disease, especially when using mammalian research models. For instance, in many mouse models created for the study of gene expression related to disease, researchers typically don t take into account whether specific genetic expression originates from mothers or fathers. But the UNC research shows that inheriting a mutation has different consequences in mammals, depending on whether the genetic variant is inherited from the mother or father.  This is an exceptional new research finding that opens the door to an entirely new area of exploration in human genetics,  said Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena, PhD, professor of genetics and senior author of the paper.  We ve known that there are 95 genes that are subject to this parent-of-origin effect. They re called imprinted genes, and they can play roles in diseases, depending on whether the genetic mutation came from the father or the mother. Now we ve found that in addition to them, there are thousands of other genes that have a novel parent-of-origin effect.  These genetic mutations that are handed down from parents show up in many common but complex diseases that involve many genes, such as type-2 diabetes, heart disease, schizophrenia, obesity, and cancers. Studying them in genetically diverse mouse models that take parent-of-origin into account will give scientists more precise insights into the underlying causes of disease and the creation of therapeutics or other interventions. The key to this research is the Collaborative Cross   the most genetically diverse mouse population in the world, which is generated, housed, and distributed from UNC. Traditional lab mice are much more limited in their genetic diversity, and so they have limited use in studies that try to home in on important aspects of diseases in humans. The Collaborative Cross bred together various wild type mice to create wide diversity in the mouse genome. Pardo-Manuel de Villena said that this diversity is comparable to the variation found in the human genome. This helps scientists study diseases that involve various levels of genetic expression across many different genes. Gene expression connects DNA to proteins, which then carry out various functions inside cells. This process is crucial for proper human health. Mutations that alter gene expression are called regulatory mutations.  This type of genetic variation is probably the most important contributor   not to simple Mendelian diseases where there s just one gene mutation [such as cystic fibrosis]   but to much more common and complex diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, neurological conditions, and a host of others,  Pardo-Manuel de Villena said.  These diseases are driven by gene expression, not of one gene but of hundreds or thousands of genes.  The Collaborative Cross and the expertise we have at UNC allow us to look at different gene expression for every gene in the genome of every kind of tissue,  said Pardo-Manuel de Villena, who directs the Collaborative Cross. For the Nature Genetics study, Pardo-Manuel de Villena s team, including first author James Crowley, PhD, assistant professor of genetics, selected three genetically diverse inbred strains of mice that were descended from a subspecies that evolved on different continents. These mice were bred to create nine different types of hybrid offspring in which each strain was used as both father and mother. When the mice reached adulthood, the researchers measured gene expression in four different kinds of tissue, including RNA sequencing in the brain. They then quantified how much gene expression was derived from the mother and the father for every single gene in the genome.  We found that the vast majority of genes   about 80 percent   possessed variants that altered gene expression,  Crowley said.  And this was when we discovered a new, genome-wide expression imbalance in favor of the dad in several hundred genes. This imbalance resulted in offspring whose brain gene expression was significantly more like their father s.  For every gene a scientist is interested in, Pardo-Manuel de Villena s team can create mice that have low, intermediate, or high expression of genes. And they can explore if that expression is associated with a specific disease.  This expression level is dependent on the mother or the father,  Pardo-Manuel de Villena said.  We now know that mammals express more genetic variance from the father. So imagine that a certain kind of mutation is bad. If inherited from the mother, the gene wouldn t be expressed as much as it would be if it were inherited from the father. So, the same bad mutation would have different consequences in disease if it were inherited from the mother or from the father.  These types of genetic mutations across hundreds of genes are hard to study and a major bottleneck to realizing the promises of the post-genome era. But Pardo-Manuel de Villena said,  Thanks to the Collaborative Cross, the mouse can be used to model how these genes work and how they impact health and disease in any kind of tissue in the body.

A new nanodevice developed by MIT researchers can help overcome that by first blocking the gene that confers drug resistance, then launching a new chemotherapy attack against the disarmed tumors. The device, which consists of gold nanoparticles embedded in a hydrogel that can be injected or implanted at a tumor site, could also be used more broadly to disrupt any gene involved in cancer.  You can target any genetic marker and deliver a drug, including those that don t necessarily involve drug-resistance pathways. It s a universal platform for dual therapy,  says Natalie Artzi, a research scientist at MIT s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES), an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, and senior author of a paper describing the device in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the week of March 2. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach, Artzi and colleagues tested it in mice implanted with a type of human breast tumor known as a triple negative tumor. Such tumors, which lack any of the three most common breast cancer markers   estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Her2   are usually very difficult to treat. Using the new device to block the gene for multidrug resistant protein 1 (MRP1) and then deliver the chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil, the researchers were able to shrink tumors by 90 percent in two weeks. Overcoming resistance MRP1 is one of many genes that can help tumor cells become resistant to chemotherapy. MRP1 codes for a protein that acts as a pump, eliminating cancer drugs from tumor cells and rendering them ineffective. This pump acts on several drugs other than 5-fluorouracil, including the commonly used cancer drug doxorubicin.  Drug resistance is a huge hurdle in cancer therapy and the reason why chemotherapy, in many cases, is not very effective , says Jo o Conde, an IMES postdoc and lead author of the PNAS paper. To overcome this, the researchers created gold nanoparticles coated with strands of DNA complementary to the sequence of MRP1 messenger RNA   the snippet of genetic material that carries DNA s instructions to the rest of the cell. These strands of DNA, which the researchers call  nanobeacons,  fold back on themselves to form a closed hairpin structure. However, when the DNA encounters the correct mRNA sequence inside a cancer cell, it unfolds and binds to the mRNA, preventing it from generating more molecules of the MRP1 protein. As the DNA unfolds, it also releases molecules of 5-fluorouracil that were embedded in the strand. This drug then attacks the tumor cell s DNA, since MRP1 is no longer around to pump it out of the cell.  When we silence the gene, the cell is no longer resistant to that drug, so we can deliver the drug that now regains its efficacy,  Conde says. When each of these events occurs   sensing the MRP1 protein and releasing 5-fluorouracil   the device emits fluorescence of different wavelengths, allowing the researchers to visualize what is happening inside the cells. Because of this, the particles could also be used for diagnosis   specifically, determining if a certain cancer-related gene is activated in tumor cells. Controlled drug release The DNA-coated gold nanoparticles are embedded in an adhesive gel that stays in place and coats the tumor after being implanted. This local administration of the particles protects them from degradation that might occur if they were administered throughout the body, and also enables sustained drug release, Artzi says. In their mouse studies, the researchers found that the particles could silence MRP1 for up to two weeks, with continuous drug release over that time, effectively shrinking tumors. This approach could be adapted to deliver any kind of drug or gene therapy targeted to a specific gene involved in cancer, the researchers say. They are now working on using it to silence a gene that stimulates gastric tumors to metastasize to the lungs.  This is an impressive study that harnesses expertise at the interface of materials science, nanotechnology, biology, and medicine to enhance the efficacy of traditional chemotherapeutics,  says Jeffrey Karp, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women s Hospital, who was not involved in the research.  Hopefully this approach will perform in studies beyond 14 days and be translatable to patients, who are desperate for new and more effective treatment regimens.  Graduate student Nuria Oliva is also an author of the paper. The research was funded by the National Cancer Institute and a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship.","Published: March 4, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/water-in-smog-may-reveal-pollution-sources-213838,Water In Smog May Reveal Pollution Sources Vapor variations in SLC inversions tied to cars  furnaces  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The chemical signature of water vapor emitted by combustion sources such as vehicles and furnaces has been found in the smoggy winter inversions that often choke Salt Lake City. The discovery may give researchers a new tool to track down the sources of pollutants and climate-changing carbon dioxide gas. University of Utah scientists measured ratios of rare and common isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in water, and estimated that water vapor from burning fossil fuels makes up as much as 13 percent of the water vapor in smog during Salt Lake s winter inversions, with the percentage starting smaller and increasing as the inversion persists.  Probably the two largest sources are cars and home heating,  says geochemist Gabe Bowen, senior author of the study published online in this week s issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  During inversion days, we see times with especially high levels of combustion water in the air, such as immediately following the morning and evening rush hours. Morning is more pronounced,  he says.  The other is overnight, when we see continuous high levels, most likely related to home heating. We know the water is coming from fossil-fuel combustion because its concentration rises and falls with levels of carbon dioxide emitted by fuel burning.  And water vapor in Salt Lake s stagnant, smoggy winter inversions  contributes to the  chill  we feel during these events, and likely also to frost formation and icy roads,  says Bowen, a University of Utah associate professor of geology and geophysics. He says water from fossil-fuel burning  is a thus-far undocumented aspect of environmental emissions during inversion season,  and the study provides a new tool for measuring how much water is added to the atmosphere by burning fuel in cars, furnaces, industry and other sources.  The new approach may help researchers monitor sources of greenhouse gas emissions from cities and study the impact of water of combustion on urban weather, quality of life and atmospheric chemistry,  the study says. Bowen says the new technique for measuring the sources of combustion water in urban air  is in the early stages. We have a lot of ideas about potential applications.  The study didn t measure how much water vapor came from vehicles versus furnaces. But  our hope is that we will be able to distinguish emissions from different sources based on their contribution to water in the atmosphere over the city,  he adds. The researchers also hope to apply their method to measuring greenhouse gas emissions from wood stoves or industrial combustion sources that produce water vapor, and  we might be able to use it to look at the efficiency of combustion   to diagnose combustion problems in car engines or industrial processes,  Bowen says. Water vapor makes inversions cold and damp Bowen conducted the University of Utah study with technicians Galen Gorski and Ryan Bares; Courtenay Strong, assistant professor of atmospheric sciences; Stephen Good, postdoctoral researcher in geology and geophysics; and James Ehleringer, distinguished professor of biology.  Funding came from the National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Energy and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The study dealt with water vapor in the  boundary layer    the cold, smoggy layer from the ground up to the warmer air layer that caps and traps the inversion. Bowen says water vapor from burning fuels  is not as scary as other stuff that comes out of our tailpipes. But it affects our local environment during these inversions.   In many or most inversion events humidity increases in the lower atmosphere, and that contributes to the apparent temperature and overnight frost formation,  he adds.  These events feel gray, gloomy and damp compared with the rest of our winter. Part of the reason is combustion-emitted water trapped in the boundary layer at the surface.  Cocaine, evolution, murder   and now water vapor The new study represents the latest use for stable isotope analysis, a technique that looks at ratios of rare to common weights or isotopes of elements such as hydrogen, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. The isotopes are stable; they don t decay radioactively. University of Utah researchers have used the method to help identify sources of cocaine and counterfeit currency, the diets of early human ancestors and the routes traveled by elephants in Africa, and even to help identify a murder victim based on isotope analysis or hair that pointed police to the region where the victim had lived. In natural water, the ratio of heavier, rare oxygen-18 to lighter, common oxygen-16 is low because the heavier isotope falls out first as rainstorms move inland. The same is true of deuterium, rare hydrogen-2, compared with the common isotope, hydrogen-1. Water produced from burning or combustion is different. The ratio of hydrogen-2 to hydrogen-1 is very low, because hydrogen in fuel comes from ancient plants and microbes that preferred hydrogen-1. But the ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 is much higher compared with natural water. That s because burning fuel uses oxygen in air   oxygen produced by plant leaves from which heavier oxygen-18 evaporated more slowly than lighter oxygen-16. Bowen and colleagues used this unusual signature to devise a scale on which they can estimate the amount of combustion-derived vapor in any air sample. The approach works best in inversions during Utah winters, but the researchers believe they may also be able to detect water from combustion with careful measurements during times without inversions. From Dec. 3, 2013 to Jan. 31, 2014   a period with four inversions   Bowen and colleagues measured carbon dioxide and water vapor concentrations and water vapor isotope ratios an average of every five minutes. They found the amount of combustion water vapor in the air tracked closely with the amount of carbon dioxide. During each inversion, both increased. During three of the inversions, both gases leveled off or fell when the inversions mixed somewhat with cleaner air. Combustion water vapor and carbon dioxide climbed from 7 to 10 a.m. due to traffic, began dropping at 10:30 a.m., then rose during the evening rush, peaked by 8 p.m. and remained level until midnight as furnaces worked. The vapor and gas levels dropped by 3 a.m., due to canyon winds and as dew and frost reduced water in the air. The researchers estimated oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition of water from burning natural gas and gasoline, confirming their estimates for gasoline by testing tailpipe water from an inefficient old SUV and younger, more efficient sedan. They calculated how much water from tailpipes must be added to the air to produce the levels seen in the air during inversions. They estimated conservatively that up to 13 percent of water vapor in inversions comes from burning fuels. That is a large percentage given that combustion water is only 0.004 percent of the global water cycle. Co-author Strong created a computer model to simulate how water enters a Salt Lake City inversion from wind, rain, snow and combustion emissions, how those contribute to air moisture. The model predicted what researchers saw, including the daily patterns of traffic and furnace water vapor. The peak in combustion water vapor during the overnight home-heating period was about half that as after morning and evening rush hours, largely because modern furnaces condense water as they extract heat.  We might use this new tool to understand where the carbon dioxide emissions are coming from,  Bowen says.  Emissions of carbon dioxide from different sources will produce different amounts of water vapor.  The same may prove true of other combustion pollutants such as fine particulates and nitrous oxides, eventually allowing water vapor to be used to better track their sources as well.","Published: March 4, 2015"

The researchers, from the University of Michigan Medical School and Johns Hopkins University, reviewed two decades' worth of research to reach their conclusions about drugs like antipsychotics and antidepressants, and non-drug approaches that help caregivers address behavioral issues in dementia patients. They lay out their findings along with a framework that doctors and caregivers can use to make the most of what's already known. Called DICE for Describe, Investigate, Evaluate, and Create, the framework tailors approaches to each person with dementia, and as symptoms change. ""The evidence for non-pharmaceutical approaches to the behavior problems often seen in dementia is better than the evidence for antipsychotics, and far better than for other classes of medication,"" says first author Helen C. Kales, M.D., head of the U-M Program for Positive Aging at the University of Michigan Health System and investigator at the VA Center for Clinical Management Research. ""The issue and the challenge is that our health care system has not incentivized training in alternatives to drug use, and there is little to no reimbursement for caregiver-based methods."" Coincidentally, a new U.S. Government Accountability Office report published the same day as the BMJ paper addresses the issue of overuse of antipsychotic medication for the behavior problems often seen in dementia. It finds that one-third of older adults with dementia who had long-term nursing home stays in 2012 were prescribed an antipsychotic medication -- and that about 14 percent of those outside nursing homes were prescribed an antipsychotic that same year. The GAO calls on the federal government to work to reduce use of these drugs further than it's already doing, by addressing use in dementia patients outside nursing homes. Kales, however, cautions that penalizing doctors for prescribing antipsychotic drugs to these patients could backfire, if caregiver-based non-drug approaches aren't encouraged. She and her colleagues from Johns Hopkins, Laura N. Gitlin PhD and Constantine Lyketsos MD, note in their paper that ""there needs to be a shift of resources from paying for psychoactive drugs and emergency room and hospital stays to adopting a more proactive approach."" But they also write, ""drugs still have their place, especially for the management of acute situations where the safety of the person with dementia or family caregiver may be at risk."" For instance, antidepressants make sense for dementia patients with severe depression, and antipsychotic drugs should be used when patients have psychosis or aggression that could lead them to harm themselves or others. But these uses should be closely monitored and ended as soon as possible. The authors lay out five non-pharmacologic categories to start with based on their review of the medical evidence. These approaches have been shown to help reduce behavior issues: They also note that many ""hidden"" medical issues in dementia patients -- such as urinary tract infection and other infections, constipation, dehydration and pain -- can lead to behavioral issues, as can drug interactions. So physicians should look to assess and address these wherever possible. Kales, Gitlin and Lyketsos are working with the U-M Center for Health Communications Research to launch a National Institute of Nursing Research-sponsored clinical trial this spring that will test the DICE approach through a computer based tool for caregivers called the WeCareAdvisor. The tool will help families identify tips and resources in a single computer interface to address behavioral symptoms. The tips are designed to prevent or mitigate possible triggers for common behavioral symptoms such as pacing, repetitive questioning, restlessness, or shadowing. . For instance, de-cluttering the environment, using music or simple activities that help to engage a person with dementia , or using a calm voice instead of being confrontational, could help greatly to reduce behavioral symptoms, Kales says. And making sure that caregivers get breaks from their responsibilities and take care of themselves, especially in the home, can help them avoid burnout and taking their frustration out on patients. ""Behavior-based strategies may take longer than prescriptions,"" acknowledges Kales, a member of the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation. ""But if you teach people the principles behind DICE, the approach becomes more natural and part of one's routine. It can be very empowering for caregivers or nursing home staff."" More research on both new drug options and the best ways to assess and address behavioral symptoms is needed, the authors conclude. But in the meantime, the evidence to date comes down in favor of non-drug approaches in most cases. The components of the DICE approach are: University of Michigan Health System   press release H.C.

The study's findings could improve clinical assessment and care for these high-risk children by potentially enabling earlier identification, treatment or possible preventive measures. The study is among the first to show that subthreshold manic episodes -- experiences that approach but do not meet the cut-offs for full-blown bipolar disorder -- are important diagnostic risk factors for the development of bipolar disorder and other mental health conditions in high-risk children. In addition, it found that children of parents with bipolar disorder have substantially higher rates of subthreshold mania or hypomania (13.3 vs 1.2 percent); manic, mixed or hypomanic episodes (9.2 vs 0.8 percent); and major depressive episodes (32.0 vs 14.9 percent) than community children. ""Mental health practitioners should carefully assess for short episodes of manic symptoms, major depression and disruptive behavior disorders in high-risk children, as these are risk factors for the future onset of bipolar disorder,"" said David Axelson, MD, medical director of Behavioral Health at Nationwide Children's Hospital and senior author on the study. ""This may be particularly important if medication is going to be used for treating mood or behavioral symptoms in the child, because some medications might increase the risk of developing mania or psychotic symptoms in someone who is already at very high risk for developing bipolar disorder. Prescribers might choose different medication options, or use lower doses and monitor for problems more closely."" The cumulative rate of bipolar spectrum disorders at age 21 was 23 percent in the high-risk group compared to 3.2 percent in the comparison group. The mean age of onset for a bipolar spectrum disorder was 12 years, with the earliest manic episode being documented at 8 years, highlighting the importance of monitoring subthreshold symptoms for early intervention. ""Most children who have a parent with bipolar disorder will have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder, such as attention-deficit disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, an anxiety disorder or depression, at some point during their youth,"" said Dr. Axelson, who is also a professor of clinical psychiatry at The Ohio State University. ""However, most children who have a parent with bipolar disorder do not develop bipolar disorder."" Among the study's high-risk children who did develop bipolar disorder, nearly all had identifiable mood episodes and other psychiatric disorders before the onset of full-fledged bipolar illness. ""Short, distinct episodes of manic symptoms were the most specific predictor of developing bipolar disorder in high-risk offspring,"" Dr. Axelson said. ""But so far, many children with these short manic episodes have not progressed to full-fledged bipolar disorder."" This study is part of the Pittsburgh Bipolar Offspring Study (BIOS), which is the largest study to date of children of parents with bipolar disorder. Unique to BIOS is the assessment of children for subthreshold episodes of manic symptoms. This latest publication confirms and extends the baseline findings and describes how mood episodes develop in an effort to aid in early diagnosis on the basis of those subthreshold episodes. The longitudinal study followed high-risk children and demographically matched offspring of community parents. Follow-up interviews were completed in 91 percent of the offspring with a mean follow-up duration of 6.8 years. The initial and follow-up interviews were conducted using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (parents) and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (children). Follow-ups focused on the assessment of the interval since the previous interview. ""I am continuing to collaborate with researchers on the Pittsburgh Bipolar Offspring Study,"" Dr. Axelson said.

A new Weizmann Institute study suggests one of the reasons for this ancient custom may be to check out each other's odors. Even if we are not consciously aware of this, handshaking may provide people with a socially acceptable way of communicating via the sense of smell. Not only do people often sniff their own hands, but they do so for a much longer time after shaking someone else's hand, the study has found. As reported in the journal eLife, the number of seconds the subjects spent sniffing their own right hand more than doubled after an experimenter greeted them with a handshake. ""Our findings suggest that people are not just passively exposed to socially-significant chemical signals, but actively seek them out,"" said Idan Frumin, the research student who conducted the study under the guidance of Prof. Noam Sobel of Weizmann's Neurobiology Department. ""Rodents, dogs and other mammals commonly sniff themselves, and they sniff one another in social interactions, and it seems that in the course of evolution, humans have retained this practice -- only on a subliminal level."" To examine whether handshakes indeed transfer body odors, the researchers first had experimenters wearing gloves shake the subjects' bare hands, then tested the glove for smell residues. They found that a handshake alone was sufficient for the transfer of several odors known to serve as meaningful chemical signals in mammals. ""It's well known that germs can be passed on through skin contact in handshakes, but we've shown that potential chemical messages, known as chemosignals, can be passed on in the same manner,"" Frumin says. Next, to explore the potential role of handshakes in communicating odors, the scientists used covert cameras to film some 280 volunteers before and after they were greeted by an experimenter, who either shook their hand or didn't. The researchers found that after shaking hands with an experimenter of the same gender, subjects more than doubled the time they later spent sniffing their own right hand (the shaking one). In contrast, after shaking hands with an experimenter of the opposite gender, subjects increased the sniffing of their own left hand (the non-shaking one). ""The sense of smell plays a particularly important role in interactions within gender, not only across gender as commonly assumed,"" Frumin says. The scientists then performed a series of tests to make sure the hand-sniffing indeed served the purpose of checking out odors and was not merely a stress-related response to a strange situation. First, they measured nasal airflow during the task and found that subjects were truly sniffing their hands and not just lifting them to their nose. It turned out that the amount of air inhaled by the volunteers through the nose doubled when they brought their hands to their face. Next, the scientists found they could manipulate the hand-sniffing by artificially introducing different smells into the experimental setting. For example, when experimenters were tainted with a commercial unisex perfume, the hand-sniffing increased. In contrast, when the experimenters were tainted with odors derived from sex hormones, the sniffing decreased. These final tests confirmed the olfactory nature of the hand-sniffing behavior. Taking part in the study were Ofer Perl, Yaara Endevelt-Shapira, Ami Eisen, Neetai Eshel, Iris Heller, Maya Shemesh, Aharon Ravia, Dr. Lee Sela and Dr. Anat Arzi, all of Prof. Sobel's lab ""Handshakes vary in strength, duration and posture, so they convey social information of various sorts,"" says Prof. Sobel. ""But our findings suggest that at its evolutionary origins, handshaking might have also served to convey odor signals, and such signaling may still be a meaningful, albeit subliminal, component of this custom.""

Patients scheduled for surgery may experience considerable stress and anxiety. Benzodiazepine (a class of sedatives) premedication is frequently used to reduce anxiety but also causes amnesia, drowsiness, and cognitive impairment. Treating anxiety is not necessarily associated with a better perioperative (before and after surgery) experience for the patient. More needs to be known about the efficacy of preoperative anxiety treatment to better counsel patients to make informed decisions, according to background information in the article. Axel Maurice-Szamburski, M.D., of the H pital de la Timone Adulte, Marseille, France, and colleagues randomly assigned 1,062 adult patients (younger than 70 years of age) who had been scheduled for various elective surgeries under general anesthesia at 5 French teaching hospitals to receive either 2.5 mg of lorazepam (approximately two hours before being transferred to the operating room), placebo, or no premedication. The perioperative patient experience was assessed 24 hours after surgery with a questionnaire. The researchers found that premedication with lorazepam did not improve a measure of overall patient satisfaction compared with no premedication or placebo. Of the most anxious patients, no significant differences were found for overall patient satisfaction between the groups. The time to extubation was significantly longer in the lorazepam group (17 minutes) than in the no premedication (12 minutes) and placebo (13 minutes) groups. Forty minutes after the end of anesthesia, the rate of patients scoring as recovered regarding cognition was significantly lower in the lorazepam group (51 percent) than in the no pre medication group (71 percent) and the placebo group (64 percent). On postoperative day 1, the number of patients with amnesia during the perioperative period was higher in the lorazepam group than in the other groups. ""Compared with placebo, lorazepam did reduce patient anxiety upon arrival to the operating room. Because there was no overall benefit from preoperative anxiety treatment, it is possible that anxiety arising upon arrival to the operating room does not influence overall patient satisfaction,"" the authors write.

After a long period of not being able to do precise genetic analysis of mCNVs in human genetics, these tools   both whole-genome sequencing and nimble Droplet Digital PCR assays   will finally enable careful genetic analysis of mCNVs in human cohorts. Reassuringly, these approaches appear to yield results that agree strongly with each other,  said Steven McCarroll, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, director of genetics for the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute, and senior author of the Nature Genetics paper in which these findings were published. McCarroll s team found that mCNVs are responsible for nearly 90% of the observed differences in gene copy number, or gene dosage, between humans.  mCNVs are much more extensive and have a larger impact on gene-dosage variation than previously thought,  said McCarroll.  We also determined that mCNVs contribute substantially to gene expression variation, suggesting that they have the potential to contribute to variation in phenotypes. Because some genes affected by multicopy regions, such as HPR1 and ORM1, have disease associations, further investigation of mCNVs could enable studies of how copy number changes in these regions impact human phenotypes and disease, said Jennifer Berman, one of the paper s coauthors and staff scientist at Bio-Rad s Digital Biology Center.Droplet Digital PCR Validates NGS AnalysismCNVs have been notoriously difficult to study, due to a specific technical challenge: the inability to discriminate between higher order, consecutive copy number states (for example, six vs. seven) using existing low-precision techniques such as microarrays or standard qPCR.The advent of NGS in the last decade, and ddPCR in the last few years, has broadened and deepened the ability of researchers to perform genetic analysis.""The only two methods available to robustly call consecutive high copy number states are NGS with the new algorithms McCarroll s lab developed as part of the study and Droplet Digital PCR,  said Berman.Droplet Digital PCR, a technology developed by Bio-Rad that has been referenced in nearly 200 papers since it came to market in late 2011, is an ultraprecise and sensitive form of PCR that enables discrimination of small fold differences in target DNA copy numbers.McCarroll s research team used advanced computational methods in conjunction with existing NGS data to identify and catalog more than 8,500 CNVs in the human genome. In the analysis of 849 human genome sequences from the 1000 Genomes Project, approximately 3,900 duplication CNVs were discovered, of which roughly one-third were found to be mCNVs.To validate their NGS computational approach, which uncovered diploid copy numbers ranging from one to 15, Dr. McCarroll and his team used Bio-Rad Laboratories  award-winning QX200  Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) System. Results obtained using the two techniques were highly consistent: per individual genome, the number of copies of mCNVs quantified by ddPCR had a 99% match rate with those of NGS. This type of orthogonal validation reinforces each technique s approach and strengthens the conclusions of the study.","Published: March 3, 2015"

A new nanodevice developed by MIT researchers can help overcome that by first blocking the gene that confers drug resistance, then launching a new chemotherapy attack against the disarmed tumors. The device, which consists of gold nanoparticles embedded in a hydrogel that can be injected or implanted at a tumor site, could also be used more broadly to disrupt any gene involved in cancer.  You can target any genetic marker and deliver a drug, including those that don t necessarily involve drug-resistance pathways. It s a universal platform for dual therapy,  says Natalie Artzi, a research scientist at MIT s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES), an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, and senior author of a paper describing the device in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the week of March 2. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach, Artzi and colleagues tested it in mice implanted with a type of human breast tumor known as a triple negative tumor. Such tumors, which lack any of the three most common breast cancer markers - estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Her2 -esistant protein 1 (MRP1) and then deliver the chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil, the researchers were able to shrink tumors by 90 percent in two weeks. Overcoming resistanceMRP1 is one of many genes that can help tumor cells become resistant to chemotherapy. MRP1 codes for a protein that acts as a pump, eliminating cancer drugs from tumor cells and rendering them ineffective. This pump acts on several drugs other than 5-fluorouracil, including the commonly used cancer drug doxorubicin.  Drug resistance is a huge hurdle in cancer therapy and the reason why chemotherapy, in many cases, is not very effective , says Jo o Conde, an IMES postdoc and lead author of the PNAS paper. To overcome this, the researchers created gold nanoparticles coated with strands of DNA complementary to the sequence of MRP1 messenger RNA - the snippet of genetic material that carries DNA s instructions to the rest of the cell. These strands of DNA, which the researchers call  nanobeacons,  fold back on themselves to form a closed hairpin structure. However, when the DNA encounters the correct mRNA sequence inside a cancer cell, it unfolds and binds to the mRNA, preventing it from generating more molecules of the MRP1 protein. As the DNA unfolds, it also releases molecules of 5-fluorouracil that were embedded in the strand. This drug then attacks the tumor cell s DNA, since MRP1 is no longer around to pump it out of the cell.  When we silence the gene, the cell is no longer resistant to that drug, so we can deliver the drug that now regains its efficacy,  Conde says. When each of these events occurs - sensing the MRP1 protein and releasing 5-fluorouracil - the device emits fluorescence of different wavelengths, allowing the researchers to visualize what is happening inside the cells. Because of this, the particles could also be used for diagnosis - specifically, determining if a certain cancer-related gene is activated in tumor cells. Controlled drug releaseThe DNA-coated gold nanoparticles are embedded in an adhesive gel that stays in place and coats the tumor after being implanted. This local administration of the particles protects them from degradation that might occur if they were administered throughout the body, and also enables sustained drug release, Artzi says. In their mouse studies, the researchers found that the particles could silence MRP1 for up to two weeks, with continuous drug release over that time, effectively shrinking tumors. This approach could be adapted to deliver any kind of drug or gene therapy targeted to a specific gene involved in cancer, the researchers say. They are now working on using it to silence a gene that stimulates gastric tumors to metastasize to the lungs. Graduate student Nuria Oliva is also an author of the paper. The research was funded by the National Cancer Institute and a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship.","Published: March 3, 2015"

The funding will support the development of new technologies to assess the health of the placenta as it grows and matures, with the ultimate goal of improving the health of mothers and children.  The placenta is a lifeline that gives us our start in the world,  said Alan E. Guttmacher, M.D., director of NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which is leading the research effort.  It influences the health of mother and child not just during pregnancy, but for the rest of their lives. However, despite its important role, the placenta has received comparatively little attention.  The placenta is a temporary organ that ferries oxygen and nutrients from the mother to her fetus while at the same time removing potentially toxic substances like carbon dioxide. It also produces hormones to help maintain pregnancy and perform the unique immunologic function of allowing the mother and fetus to coexist. Problems with the placenta may lead to negative pregnancy outcomes for mother or fetus, such as preeclampsia (a disorder of high blood pressure in pregnancy), gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and stillbirth. Placental problems have also been linked to a higher risk of heart disease later in life, for both mother and child.  If we can develop technologies to monitor placental health during pregnancy, we should be able to prevent some of these problems from happening,  said Dr. Guttmacher.  We hope this funding opportunity will attract a broad range of researchers and clinicians to help - placental biologists, obstetricians, and experts in imaging, bioengineering, and other arenas.  Until now, most studies of the placenta have been limited to ultrasound exams, blood tests, and the examination of placental tissue after delivery. These studies have provided important foundational knowledge, Guttmacher said, but many questions remain about normal placental development and function and the organ s role in health and disease. The initiative seeks to spur new technologies or innovative applications of existing technologies, such as imaging tools or sensors, that would allow practitioners to safely track placental functioning during pregnancy. Such technologies might gauge how blood and oxygen flow through the placenta, how it attaches to the uterine wall, and how it conveys nutrients to the fetus.  Advances in imaging and bioengineering hold terrific promise for the study of the placenta,  said Roderic Pettigrew, Ph.D., M.D., director of NIH s National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, which is co-sponsoring the Human Placenta Project s latest initiative.  We expect that the technologies resulting from this initiative will also translate to other organs and open new avenues of study that will benefit human health.  The latest funding announcement for the Human Placenta Project, its third and largest to date, also requires applicants to address the effects of environmental factors - such as air pollution, medications, and maternal diet - on the placenta during pregnancy.  The placenta is a fascinating organ, but it s one of the least understood,  said Dr. Guttmacher.  For researchers who want to apply their skills in an area of medicine that isn t being looked at as much as both scientific opportunity and human health warrant, this is a wonderful chance.

If the rival theory is correct, it will require a major rethink of drug therapies, and the level and direction of research investments, currently aimed at preventing and treating a disease that will soon engulf 100 million globally. Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, and involves loss of memory and other intellectual abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Also known as age-related dementia, it accounts for 60 to 80 per cent of all dementia cases. The established medical view is that Alzheimer's is primarily a degenerative disease of the brain caused by the effects of accumulating protein deposits - known as ""beta-amyloid"" senile plaques and ""neurofibrillary tangles"" - that interfere with neural pathways and signaling. Whether these plaques and tangles are the primary cause for the onset of Alzheimer's is still uncertain. Some people develop plaques in brain tissue as they age without developing Alzheimer's, and it's still unknown whether plaques cause the disease or whether they're a by-product of the Alzheimer's disease process. But the alternative explanation argues that aged-related dementia has an earlier origin in the heart and vascular system, not the brain. ""Aged-related dementia is the result of undetected bleeding into the brain caused by the lifelong destructive effects of the heart's pulse on tiny blood vessels in the brain,"" says Jonathan Stone, Professor of Neurobiology at the University of Sydney. Together with colleagues from the University of Sydney and the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Stone led a recently published comprehensive review assessing the vascular explanation for age-dementia in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. ""If we live to old age, the heart destroys us. That's the conclusion more scientist are beginning to take seriously,"" he says. ""We propose that dementia is primarily vascular, caused by the destructive effect of the pulse on the cerebral blood vessels, with the loss of neurons and the pathology that Alois Alzheimer described over a century ago occurring secondarily to vascular breakdown. ""We argue, further, that dementia is age-related because the pulse becomes more intense and destructive with age."" Over the course of a lifetime, the aorta gradually hardens as the elastin in the wall of the aorta starts to fail. As an analogy, a 20 year-old's artery is like a flexible balloon, while an 80 year-old artery is more like a stiff hard garden hose. ""As this hardening happens, the aorta causes higher peaks and troughs resulting in higher blood pressure as a person ages,"" says Stone. ""With blood spurting into them with increasing intensity, the brain's blood vessels become damaged. A major contribution to understanding has come from the insights of research cardiologists, in particular Dr Michael O'Rourke of the Victor Chang Institute, who has drawn a correlation between age-related stiffening of the aorta and an increase in the intensity of the pulse. This may be the factor which links age to dementia. This is a radical idea, likely to attract its share of controversy, but one supported by several other lines of evidence. Doctors were already reconsidering the role of blood vessels in dementia more than a decade ago when major international studies revealed, unexpectedly, that people on blood pressure medication were at lower risk of dementia. Today, medical experts agree that dementia and cardiovascular disease - diseases of the heart and blood vessels, including stroke - share a set of well defined risk factors: high blood pressure, high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, smoking and obesity. What's to be done? The vascular explanation provides a rationale for prevention - anything in diet or exercise or weight control that protects our cardiovascular system is already known to protect against dementia. Today, researchers from the University of Sydney, the Brain and Mind Research Institute, the George Institute for Global Health, and the University of Cambridge are following the vascular explanation to lead a world-first effort to prevent dementia. Using a suite of new electronic and web-based interventions, they will soon commence a massive trial of low cost, high impact interventions targeting dementia risk factors in 40,000 people aged 50 to 80 years. ""Many preclinical, neurodegenerative changes in the brain occur for at least a decade before dementia symptoms become fully apparent. Therefore, it is vital that we address dementia risk factors before people show signs of brain degeneration and cognitive impairment that are on the slippery slope to dementia,"" says the University of Sydney's Sharon Naismith, who will lead the trial. While the researchers hope the range of interventions on offer will largely slow or delay the onset of dementia among 40,000 people initially targeted to participate in the research trial, those who begin showing signs of cognitive impairment will be offered more intensive, targeted treatments One great irony remains. The great achievements that have been made in preventing millions of deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke in recent decades have extended the average human lifespan well into the mid-80s, in western societies. But by 2050, dementias of all kinds will engulf more than 100 million people across the globe. In our effort to forestall disease, ageing and death, especially from heart disease and stroke, we may be unleashing a tsunami of people destined for age-related dementia, particularly if the vascular explanation holds true. Jonathan Stone puts it this way: ""We know that the biggest risk factor for dementia is age; put sardonically, the surest way to avoid dementia is to die young.""","Published: March 3, 2015"

The findings were published March 2 in the journal Nature Methods. The team, led by Dr. Abhijit Patel, assistant professor of therapeutic radiology at the Yale School of Medicine, created a tool that takes advantage of new high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies to make it easier to simultaneously measure gene activity in large numbers of cells or tissues. While DNA is considered the blueprint of life, knowledge of which genes are activated or de-activated under different conditions is fundamental to our understanding of biology and disease.   Gene expression profiling is commonly used in clinical tests. For example, in patients with breast cancer, gene expression is often measured within tumor specimens to predict the likelihood of recurrence and to determine whether chemotherapy would be beneficial. With additional validation, Patel said, this high-throughput approach could be used to measure gene expression from many patients  tumors simultaneously. Ultimately, the method could reduce the cost of such tests, making them more broadly accessible.  To make meaningful conclusions about complex gene expression patterns, it is usually necessary to perform statistical analysis on large numbers of clinical or experimental samples. We believe that this new technology will facilitate such work,  said Patel, senior author on the paper.  We are excited because this method makes large-scale RNA profiling studies more practical and accessible to most researchers and clinical labs.

Only the small remainder sets us apart. However, we have one important difference: The brain of humans is three times as big as the chimpanzee brain. During evolution our genome must have changed in order to trigger such brain growth. Wieland Huttner, Director and Research Group Leader a the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG), and his team identified for the first time a gene that is only present in humans and contributes to the reproduction of basal brain stem cells, triggering a folding of the neocortex. The researchers isolated different subpopulations of human brain stem cells and precisely identified, which genes are active in which cell type. In doing so, they noticed the gene ARHGAP11B: it is only found in humans and in our closest relatives, the Neanderthals and Denisova-Humans, but not in chimpanzees. This gene manages to trigger brain stem cells to form a bigger pool of stem cells. In that way, during brain development more neurons can arise and the cerebrum can expand. The cerebrum is responsible for cognitive functions like speaking and thinking.  Wieland Huttner s researchers developed a method that isolates and identifies special subpopulations of brain stem cells from the developing human cerebrum. No one has managed to do this so far. The scientists first isolated different stem and progenitor cell types from fetal mice and human cerebrum tissue.  In contrast to the big and folded human brain, the brain of mice is small and smooth. After the isolation, the researchers compared the genes that are active in the various cell types and were able to identify 56 genes that are only present in humans and which play a role in brain development.  We noticed that the gene ARHGAP11B is especially active in basal brain stem cells. These cells are really important for the expansion of the neocortex during evolution,  says Marta Florio, PhD student in Wieland Huttner s lab, who carried out the main part of the study. The human-specific gene also works in mice In the further course of the study, the researchers focused on the function of this special gene. The researchers suspected that if it was responsible for a bigger pool of brain stem cells in humans and thereby for an expanded cerebrum, then this human-specific gene should trigger a similar development in the smaller brain of a mouse. They introduced the gene into mice embryos and indeed: Under the influence of the human-specific gene, the mice produced significantly more brain stem cells and in half of all cases even a folding of the neocortex, which is typical for human brains.  All these results suggest that the gene ARHGAP11B plays a key role in the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex. Data from researchers working with Svante P bo from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig confirm that ARHGAP11B not only occurs in the human genome, but also existed in the Neanderthals and Denisova-Humans. Neanderthals had a similar big brain to humans.  ARHGAP11B is the first human-specific gene where we could show that it contributes to the pool of basal brain stem cells and can trigger a folding of the neocortex. In that way, we managed to take the next step in tracing evolution , summarizes Wieland Huttner. His research group has been interested in the secrets of human brain evolution for a long time.  In the last years, his researchers made several discoveries that contributed to the understanding of how a big brain could develop during evolution. In the year 2010 for example, the researchers identified a new type of stem cell in the outer growth zones of the brain. The current project of Wieland Huttner and his team was performed together with Andreas Dahl from the DFG Research Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden and Robert Lachmann from the University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus of the Dresden University of Technology.","Published: March 3, 2015"

The trial is a randomized, double blind and placebo controlled study. It aims to evaluate the safety and effects of a two-week treatment with AZP-531 on food-related behavior and on weight in up to 40 patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. The multicenter trial will be conducted in several European countries. As of today sites are open for recruitment in France and Spain. Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic metabolic syndrome, characterized by hyperphagia, an excessive eating behavior, and severe obesity. Unlike common obesity and type 2 diabetes, Prader-Willi syndrome is associated with elevated blood levels of acylated ghrelin, a hormone with strong stimulating effect on appetite. As an unacylated ghrelin analog, AZP-531 is expected to improve hyperphagia by inhibiting the effects of increased acylated ghrelin blood levels in these patients. It is also expected to decrease weight and improve glucose control, a key additional benefit as 25% of adult Prader-Willi patients have type 2 diabetes.  There is strong evidence for an abnormal regulation of the ghrelin system in Prader-Willi syndrome, associated with the development of severe hyperphagia and obesity that occur in these patients. AZP-531, an unacylated ghrelin analog, could constitute an attractive therapeutic approach by targeting a key underlying endocrine defect of the syndrome,  said Professor Ma th  Tauber, pediatric endocrinologist, Hospital of Toulouse, coordinator of the Reference Center for Prader-Willi in France and principal investigator of the trial. This trial is the fourth AZP-531 clinical trial to be launched by Aliz  Pharma. Two Phase I trials in healthy volunteers and obese subjects have been completed. The results indicate that AZP-531 was well tolerated, with improved glucose control and decreased weight in obese subjects over a two-week treatment period. A Phase Ib study in type 2 diabetes was initiated in 2014 with results expected in H2 2015.  We are very pleased to announce the start of this Phase II trial of AZP-531 in Prader-Willi syndrome,  said Thierry Abribat, manager of TAB Consulting, president of Aliz  Pharma.  We look forward to delivering key data in the near future on the therapeutic potential of AZP-531 from the two ongoing trials in type 2 diabetes and in Prader-Willi syndrome.

Due to BL-8040 s unique properties, the Phase 2b study will examine its ability to improve outcomes for AML patients who have achieved remission after standard treatment by eliminating the minimal residual disease left in the bone marrow that can lead to relapse, known as consolidation therapy. The study is expected to commence shortly after the receipt of regulatory approval, which is anticipated in the next few months, and is the first of three additional planned clinical studies that significantly expand BioLineRx s unique BL-8040 platform for treating hematological cancers. The Phase 2b trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center study conducted in collaboration with the University of Halle as sponsor and with the participation of two large leukemia study groups in Germany. Regulatory submissions with BfArM, the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut f r Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte) and the relevant ethics committees have been made. Dr. Kinneret Savitsky, Chief Executive Officer of BioLineRx, stated,  Without consolidation treatment aimed at destroying the remaining leukemic cells, AML is likely to return within several months of initial remission. The current principal options for AML consolidation therapy involve either several cycles of high-dose chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. Based on positive results from our ongoing phase 2a clinical trial for BL-8040, which show substantial mobilization of AML cancer cells from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood, as well as induction of apoptosis of AML cells, we believe BL-8040 will be a promising addition to consolidation therapy for AML patients.   Furthermore, BL-8040 has several unique mechanisms of action that enable it to positively affect various aspects of bone marrow function, both relating to healthy stem cells as well as to cancer cells. The breadth of BL-8040 s potential is reflected in the comprehensive development plan we have established for this compound. We look forward to initiating this Phase 2b trial as well as our other planned studies for 2015, and to advancing this promising treatment platform for multiple hematological indications,  concluded Dr. Savitsky.","Published: March 3, 2015"

Researchers found evidence for a variety of wheat at a submerged archaeological site off the south coast of England, 2,000 years before the introduction of farming in the UK. The team argue that the introduction of farming is usually regarded as a defining historic moment for almost all human communities leading to the development of societies that underpin the modern world. Published in the journal Science, the researchers suggest that the most plausible explanation for the wheat reaching the site is that Mesolithic Britons maintained social and trade networks spreading across Europe. These networks might have been assisted by land bridges that connected the south east coast of Britain to the European mainland, facilitating exchanges between hunters in Britain and farmers in southern Europe. Called Einkorn, the wheat was common in Southern Europe at the time it was present at the site in Southern England - located at Bouldnor Cliff. The einkorn DNA was collected from sediment that had previously formed the land surface, which was later submerged due to melting glaciers. The work was led by Dr Robin Allaby of the University of Warwick, in collaboration with co-leads Professor Vincent Gaffney of the University of Bradford and Professor Mark Pallen of Warwick Medical School, the Maritime Archaeology Trust, the University of Birmingham and the University of St. Andrews. Dr Allaby, Associate Professor at the University of Warwick s School of Life Sciences, argues that the einkorn discovery indicates that Mesolithic Britain was less insular than previously understood and that inhabitants were interacting with Neolithic southern Europeans:  8,000 years ago the people of mainland Britain were leading a hunter-gatherer existence, whilst at the same time in southern Europeans farming was gradually spreading across Europe.  Common throughout Neolithic Southern Europe, einkorn is not found elsewhere in Britain until 2,000 years after the samples found at Bouldnor Cliff. For the einkorn to have reached this site there needs to have been contact between Mesolithic Britons and Neolithic farmers far across Europe.  The land bridges provide a plausible facilitation of this contact. As such, far from being insular Mesolithic Britain was culturally and possibly physically connected to Europe.  The role of these simple British hunting societies, in many senses, puts them at the beginning of the introduction of farming and, ultimately, the changes in the economy that lead to the modern world .  The novel ancient DNA approach we used gave us a jump in sensitivity allowing us to find many of the components of this ancient landscape  Commenting on the research s findings Professor Vincent Gaffney, research co-lead and Chair in Landscape Archaeology at the University of Bradford, said:  This find is the start of a new chapter in British and European history. Not only do we now realise that the introduction of farming was far more complex than previously imagined. It now seems likely that the hunter-gather societies of Britain, far from being isolated were part of extensive social networks that traded or exchanged exotic foodstuffs across much of Europe.  The research also demonstrates that scientists and archaeologists can now analyse genetic material preserved deep within the sediments of the lost prehistoric landscapes stretching between Britain and Europe. This not only tells us more about the introduction of farming into Britain, but also about the societies that lived on the lost coastal plains for hundreds of thousands of years.  The use of ancient DNA from sediments also opens the door to new research on the older landscapes off the British Isles and coastal shelves across the world  Co-lead Professor Mark Pallen, leader of the Pallen Group at the University of Warwick s Medical School, explains how the researchers employed a metagenomic approach to study the einkorn DNA:  We chose to use a metagenomics approach in this research even though this has not commonly been used for environmental and ancient DNA research. This means we extracted and sequenced the entire DNA in the sample, rather than targeted organism-specific barcode sequences. From this we then homed in on the organisms of interest only when analysing DNA sequences . The research builds on the work of the Maritime Archaeology Trust, who also collected the sediment samples from the site. The Trust s Director, Garry Momber, commented:  Of all the projects I have worked on, Bouldnor Cliff has been the most significant. Work in the murky waters of the Solent has opened up an understanding of the UK s formative years in a way that we never dreamed possible.  The material remains left behind by the people that occupied Britain as it was finally becoming an island 8,000 years ago, show that these were sophisticated people with technologies thousands of years more advanced than previously recognized. The DNA evidence corroborates the archaeological evidence and demonstrates a tangible link with the continent that appears to have become severed when Britain became an island .

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/on-time-on-target-204388,On Time  On Target A novel tool could help personalize cancer treatments  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. By measuring how vigorously tumor cells turn on  self-destruct  signals when exposed to different cancer drugs, a novel lab test can predict within less than 24 hours which agent is most likely to work against a particular tumor, according to research from Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The scientists say this technique could lead to more reliable and rapid tools for  personalizing  cancer treatments than those that are now available. Clinical testing has already begun. A team led by oncologist Anthony Letai, HMS associate professor of medicine at Dana-Farber, reported in the February 26, 2015, online edition of the journal Cell that the test consistently predicted the  winner  among many drugs tested against a wide variety of cancer cells in the laboratory. In most cases, the answer emerged 16 hours after the anticancer compounds were mixed with tumor cells.  We demonstrated that [the test] can be exploited to select among many therapies the one that is best for a single tumor,  the researchers wrote.  We also demonstrated that it can select among many patients those [who] are most likely to respond to a single therapy.  The technique, dynamic BH3 profiling, or DBP, is designed to detect the earliest signs that a cancer cell treated with a drug is beginning to destroy itself through apoptosis, a natural quality-control process that rids the body of unneeded or dangerously abnormal cells. Cancer cells can survive by blocking the molecular signals that trigger apoptosis. Most chemotherapy treatments work by inducing a wave of  pro-death  signals in cancer cells to overcome the cells  survival signals. The death process may take several days, but with the DBP test, scientists can identify which drug or drug combination has most effectively jump-started pro-death signaling.  This new technique represents a completely novel approach to precision medicine because we can test possible treatment directly on patient samples to guide cancer therapy,  said Joan Montero, HMS research fellow in medicine in Dana-Farber s Letai lab and the first author on the report. The test must be performed on living tumor cells that were removed during surgery or a biopsy or were frozen in a manner that leaves the cells viable. It will not work on tumor samples that have been preserved in formalin, the investigators said. In their research, the scientists exposed cancer cells to a long list of  targeted  drugs that block different overactive signaling pathways that prod cancer cells into unruly growth. The drugs were tested against many different types of cancer cells, including non-small cell lung cancers, breast cancers, colon cancers, leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma.  Regardless of the pathway inhibited, or what kind of cell the cancer started in, early drug-induced death signaling predicted later cytotoxicity,  said Letai.  We can take an early peek to see if the cancer cell is being pushed toward death. What makes this especially powerful is that we re not restricted to using one drug at a time, [so] it can test the effectiveness of combinations.  In an experiment using ovarian cancer cells removed from 16 patients, DBP testing was used to predict which tumors would respond to carboplatin, a standard chemotherapy drug. Patients whose cells responded strongly in the laboratory experienced significantly longer delays before their disease progressed. A major current thrust of precision cancer medicine is to test a patient s tumor for DNA mutations that have been found to make the cancer sensitive to certain drugs that target those mutations. This isn t always successful, and most tumors likely have properties beyond mutations that determine their responsiveness to drugs. The authors of the new study said the DBP method is potentially more powerful because it tests the cancer drugs of interest directly on cells from the patient s tumor and quickly determines which drugs can kill the cancer. Going forward, the investigators plan to test the predictive power of DBP technique on samples from patients entering clinical trials and monitor whether their outcomes correlate with the test results. Once this initial testing is done, they anticipate using DBP in the clinic in the next couple of years.

Disruptions in stability cause disorders such as epilepsy, but precious little is known about this macro-level regulatory phenomenon. A new study published in eLife by Dr. Inna Slutsky of Tel Aviv University's Sackler Faculty of Medicine and Tel Aviv University (TAU)'s Sagol School of Neuroscience finds that homeostatic regulation occurs mainly in groups of neurons rather than in the individual neurons themselves. Contradicting established assumptions, Edden Slomowitz and Boaz Styr, doctoral students in Dr. Slutsky's laboratory, discovered that single brain cells, on an individual basis, were unable to autonomously stabilize ""spikes"" in neuron communication over long periods. ""Spikes"" or ""firing,"" as they are also known, are neurons' response to stimulation; they relay messages to the rest of the body. ""Neurological and psychiatric disorders often see similar or overlapping neurological symptoms, and the failure of the neuronal homeostatic system may lead to these common endpoints,"" said Dr. Slutsky. ""Understanding the principles and mechanisms involved in neuronal homeostasis may lead to new approaches in the treatment of these and other brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease."" The brain's ability to adapt to a constantly changing environment and to form and store memories is due to the extreme flexibility, or plasticity, of its neural network. But the extreme plasticity of the brain also makes it inherently prone to instability and subsequent illnesses and disorders. ""Through homeostasis, organisms are able to maintain a stable internal environment,"" said Slomowitz. ""One common example is the secretion of insulin in response to a meal to keep blood sugar levels within the normal range. While there was evidence to support the theory that there were homeostatic mechanisms at work in the brain to stabilize neuronal activity, it was unclear which precise properties were regulated."" For the purpose of the study, Slomowitz grew a neural network on an array of electrodes and recorded the activity of single individual neurons in the network. He then applied a drug which severely inhibited neural activity. In collaboration with Prof. Eli Nelken of Hebrew University and Dr. Michael Slutsky of Mantis Vision, Slomowitz found that the network returned to its original firing rate over the course of two days despite the continued presence of the drug   and even though the firing rates and patterns of individual neurons did not reflect homeostatic tendencies. ""These results were unexpected and contradicted the current dogma in the field stating that individual neurons can regulate their own firing rates in an autonomous manner,"" said Dr. Slutsky. Following up, Styr repeated the experiment in the lab using calcium imaging, which can monitor the activity of visually identifiable neurons. The calcium images revealed similar results, bolstering the conclusion that homeostasis occurs at the level of neuron populations, not on a cell-by-cell basis. The team also examined the ability of the network to differentiate between low- and high-frequency spikes, a capability critical for short-term memory. They found this detection was severely compromised two days after the introduction of the drug, even though network firing rates and patterns had been homeostatically restored. ""Our study demonstrates that neurons in a neural network act synergistically in order to keep the population spiking rates and patterns in a constant physiological range,"" said Dr. Slutsky. ""This may occur at the cost of a diminished ability to form new memories, a process which may underlie the loss of short-term memory observed in brain diseases such as Alzheimer s disease. This understanding may bring us one step closer to the understanding of the processes that precede cognitive decline in neurodegenerative disorders.""

In fact, this sort of mind reading has become a reality. In work published in Nature, researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) describe how postmortem brain slices can be ""read"" to determine how a rat was trained to behave in response to specific sounds. The work provides one of the first examples of how specific changes in the activity of individual neurons encode particular acts of learning and memory in the brain. ""Neuroscientists have previously identified brain areas involved in learning something,"" says CSHL Professor Anthony Zador, who led the team of researchers on this current work. ""But we wanted to drill down further and identify how changes at specific connections encode a particular behavioral response."" To do this, the team focused on how rats translate sound cues into behavior. The researchers trained rats to associate a specific tone with a reward. Changes in the tone -- like the difference between a tuba and a flute -- signaled the animal to look for the reward either on the left or right side of a training box. In previous work, the team discovered that activity in a specific population of neurons was crucial for animals to perform the task. This neuronal population transmitted information from one auditory brain region (the auditory cortex) to another (the auditory striatum). In the current work, the team measured the strength of the connections between these two populations of neurons, as animals learned the task. ""We found that there was a gradient in activity across the auditory striatum that corresponded to whether the animal was trained to go left or right for their reward."" explains Zador. Based upon this information, the team reasoned that they might be able to use postmortem brain slices to ""predict"" (obviously, in retrospect) how these or other rats had been trained. As Zador describes, ""We were amazed that in all cases, our predictions -- left or right -- were correct. We had deciphered a tiny piece of the neural code with which the animal encoded these memories. In essence, we could read the minds of these rats."" ""For decades scientists have been trying to map memories in the brain,"" said James Gnadt, Ph.D., a program director at the NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). ""This study shows that scientists can precisely pinpoint the synapses where certain memories are expressed."" According to Zador, the results are likely to be broadly applicable to other senses and parts of the brain.

Clinicians at Albany Medical Center and the State University New York Empire State College in Saratoga Springs used a treatment called image-guided, intranasal sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) blocks to give patients enough ongoing relief that they required less medication to relieve migraine pain. ""Migraine headaches are one of the most common, debilitating diseases in the Unites States, and the cost and side effects of medicine to address migraines can be overwhelming,"" said Kenneth Mandato, M.D., the study's lead researcher and an interventional radiologist at Albany Medical Center. ""Intranasal sphenopalatine ganglion blocks are image-guide, targeted, breakthrough treatments. They offer a patient-centered therapy that has the potential to break the migraine cycle and quickly improve patients' quality of life,"" he added. Mandato and his team conducted a retrospective analysis of 112 patients suffering migraine or cluster headaches. Patients reported the severity of their headaches on a visual analogue scale (VAS), ranging from 1-10, to quantify the degree of debilitation experienced from the migraine. During the treatment, which is minimally invasive and does not involve needles touching the patient, researchers inserted a spaghetti-sized catheter through the nasal passages and administered 4 percent lidocaine to the sphenopalatine ganglion, a nerve bundle just behind the nose associated with migraines. Before treatment, patients reported an average VAS score of 8.25, with scores greater than 4 at least 15 days per month. The day after the SPG block patients' VAS scores were cut in half, to an average of 4.10. Thirty days after the procedure, patients reported an average score of 5.25, a 36 percent decrease from pretreatment. Additionally, 88 percent of patients indicated that they required less or no migraine medication for ongoing relief. ""Administration of lidocaine to the sphenopalatine ganglion acts as a 'reset button' for the brain's migraine circuitry,"" noted Mandato. ""When the initial numbing of the lidocaine wears off, the migraine trigger seems to no longer have the maximum effect that it once did. Some patients have reported immediate relief and are making fewer trips to the hospital for emergency headache medicine,"" he said. Because of the minimally invasive nature of the treatment and the medication's safety profile, Mandato believes patients can have the SPG block repeated, if needed. While patients reported relief from their migraines, Mandato added that SPG blocks are not a cure for migraines; they are a temporary solution as are other current treatment options for chronic headaches. Because of the minimally invasive nature of the treatment and the medication's safety profile, Mandato believes patients can have the SPG block repeated, if needed.

Just over half of the award is available in the first year; the rest will come through in year two pending availability of funds and project progress.  The award will support the further development of Recursion s Drug Screening Platform for hundreds of rare genetic diseases.   Recursion s focus on rapidly finding new uses for known drugs fits closely with NCATS initiatives, which includes Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs.   NCATS is working diligently to increase small business participation in federally supported research and development,  said Lili Portilla, NCATS director of strategic alliances.  Our SBIR and STTR programs are just two of NCATS  initiatives to fund small businesses with an eye toward commercialization of tools and therapies that will get more treatments to more patients more quickly.  Chris Gibson, Ph.D., Co-founder and CEO of Recursion remarked:  We are incredibly excited to announce this award, which will enable us to expand our work to model thousands of rare genetic diseases. Our focus on repositioning drugs for which we already have human safety data means that any discovery we make has likely already been significantly de-risked.  The timing of the NIH award coincides with International Rare Disease Day on Saturday, Feb. 28. Rare diseases affect nearly 1 in 10 Americans, yet identifying novel treatments for each of these thousands of diseases using traditional approaches doesn t scale economically.  We expect that our approach, along with partnerships now in the works with larger pharmaceutical companies, will help accelerate the discovery of treatments for many of these diseases in a much shorter timescale,  Gibson said. The award provides support for Recursion to model 2,000 genetic diseases in multiple human cell types. The company uses high-throughput microscopy to image these models and computational algorithms to identify structural changes in the cells that can be considered to be fingerprints for each disease. When a disease fingerprint is identified, Recursion will evaluate the potential of a few thousand known or experimental drugs to rescue the model. This approach means that companies or institutions that partner with Recursion will be able to evaluate the potential of their mature molecules as treatments for hundreds of diseases in an incredibly short period of time. Blake Borgeson, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer of the company added:  Our entire effort is about scale, efficiency and turning drug discovery into a data-science problem. By harnessing several recent technological advances in experimental biology, imaging and computational analysis, we are able to parallelize the process. This award is a vote of confidence in our innovative approach, and will enable us to accelerate our work.  Recursion has already modeled 65 genetic diseases and is conducting drug screens on a subset of these now. The identification of two potential treatments for a disease called Cerebral Cavernous Malformation gave rise to the idea for Recursion when the technology was still in the academic laboratory of Dr. Dean Y. Li, M.D., Ph.D., Vice Dean of Research at University of Utah Health Sciences. Dr. Li sees Recursion as a model for the type of translational science the University is focusing on promoting:  The core ideas for Recursion s approach were made in my laboratory when a number of scientists with diverse backgrounds tried to solve a specific problem. That idea has spawned a company, which now has received millions of dollars in grants and private funding within 18 months of its formation and employs 4 graduates of the University. This cycle of academic innovation leading to real translational work is precisely what the University of Utah hopes to continue fostering.  Dr. Li is a founder of the company and its Chief Scientific Officer.","Published: March 2, 2015"

Parasites adapt in response to their host organisms' defences and in many cases this adaptation is specific to a particular host species.  A. candida is a plant pathogen and could be easily confused with a fungus despite being very distantly related to fungi. The plant parasite can grow on diverse plants of the cabbage family, including vegetable crops and common weeds.  The project ( Albugon ) was led by Prof Jonathan Jones at The Sainsbury Lab (TSL), Norwich, who won a five-year Advanced Investigator Grant from the European Research Council to fund the work.  A team of scientists at TSL, including Mark McMullan, now of The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC),  genome sequencing to identify the important differences between A. candida races that infect different weeds and crops.  The research showed that isolates of the parasite that infect different plants carry distinct gene repertoires, but nevertheless carry shared segments of the genome, indicating recent and continuing gene exchange between races that grow on different hosts. This suggests parasite races that infect crop species may be regularly receiving infusions of genetic variation from races that infect weeds.  We were puzzled that distinct races of Albugo show evidence of genetic exchange, even though they grow on different host species  said Prof. Jonathan Jones.  However, we then realised that this could be explained by the extraordinary capacity of Albugo to shut down host defences. Put simply, we believe Albugo suppresses immunity of host plants so that it can have sex .  Interactions and evolution of plants and microbes is fundamental to agriculture and global food security. Due to the advances in genomics, it is now feasible to look at very many genomes within a wild species,  said Dr Mark McMullan, Population & Evolutionary Biologist in the Plant & Microbial Genomics Group at TGAC and first author of the study.   This has opened the door for scientists to conduct their genome analyses using population genetic techniques, a combination of advanced methods that began development long before the discovery of the structure of DNA. These methods will further advance our understanding of plant pathogen evolution. ","Published: March 2, 2015"

The study, led by researchers at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) and at the New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF), was published last month in the online issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation. In a separate study, which appeared in the Feb. 10 issue of the journal Development, Kevin Eggan, PhD; Florian Merkle; and Alexander Schier of Harvard University have also succeeded in creating hypothalamic neurons from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. These neurons help to regulate behavioral and basic physiological functions in the human body, including, in addition to appetite, hypertension, sleep, mood, and some social disorders. The investigators at Columbia and Harvard shared ideas during the course of the research, and these studies are co-validating.  Mice are a good model for studying obesity in humans, but it would better to have human cells for testing. Unfortunately, the cells that regulate appetite are located in an inaccessible part of the brain, the hypothalamus. So, until now, we ve had to make do with a mouse model or with human cells harvested at autopsy. This has greatly limited our ability to study fundamental aspects of human obesity,  said senior author Rudolph L. Leibel, MD, the Christopher J. Murphy Memorial Professor of Diabetes Research, professor of pediatrics and medicine, and co-director of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center at CUMC. To make the neurons, human skin cells were first genetically reprogrammed to become iPS cells. Like natural stem cells, iPS cells are capable of developing into any kind of adult cell when given a specific set of molecular signals in a specific order. The iPS cell technology has been used to create a variety of adult human cell types, including insulin-producing beta cells and forebrain and motor neurons.  But until now, no one has been able to figure out how to convert human iPS cells into hypothalamic neurons,  said co-author Dieter Egli, PhD, assistant professor of pediatrics (in developmental cell biology), a member of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, and a senior research fellow at NYSCF.  This is a wonderful example of several institutions coming together to collaborate and advance research in pursuit of new therapeutic interventions. The ability to make this type of neuron brings us one step closer to the development of new treatments for obesity,  said Susan L. Solomon, CEO of NYSCF. The CUMC/NYSCF team determined which signals are needed to transform iPS cells into arcuate hypothalamic neurons, a neuron subtype that regulates appetite. The transformation process took about 30 days. The neurons were found to display key functional properties of mouse arcuate hypothalamic neurons, including the ability to accurately process and secrete specific neuropeptides and to respond to metabolic signals such as insulin and leptin.  We don t think that these neurons are identical to natural hypothalamic neurons, but they are close and will still be useful for studying the neurophysiology of weight control, as well as molecular abnormalities that lead to obesity,  said Dr. Leibel.  In addition, the cells will allow us to evaluate potential obesity drugs in a way never before possible.   This shows,  said Dr. Eggan,  how improved understanding of stem cell biology is making an impact on our ability to study, understand, and eventually treat disorders of the nervous system. Because there are so few hypothalamic neurons of a given type, they have been notoriously difficult to study. The successful work by both groups shows that this problem has been cracked.

The device, called a nerve guidance conduit (NGC), is a framework of tiny tubes, which guide the damaged nerve ends towards each other so that they can repair naturally. Patients with nerve injuries can suffer complete loss of sensation in the damaged area, which can be extremely debilitating. Current methods of repairing nerve damage require surgery to suture or graft the nerve endings, a practice which often yields imperfect results. Although some NGCs are currently used in surgery, they can only be made using a limited range of materials and designs, making them suitable only for certain types of injury. The technique, developed in Sheffield s Faculty of Engineering, uses Computer Aided Design (CAD) to design the devices, which are then fabricated using laser direct writing, a form of 3D printing. The advantage of this is that it can be adapted for any type of nerve damage or even tailored to an individual patient. Researchers used the 3D printed guides to repair nerve injuries using a novel mouse model developed in Sheffield s Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health to measure nerve regrowth. They were able to demonstrate successful repair over an injury gap of 3mm, in a 21-day period.  The advantage of 3D printing is that NGCs can be made to the precise shapes required by clinicians,  says John Haycock, Professor of Bioengineering at Sheffield.  We ve shown that this works in animal models, so the next step is to take this technique towards the clinic . The Sheffield team used a material called polyethylene glycol, which is already cleared for clinical use and is also suitable for use in 3D printing.  Further work is already underway to investigate device manufacture using biodegradable materials, and also making devices that can work across larger injuries  says Dr Frederik Claeyssens, Senior Lecturer in Biomaterials at Sheffield.  Now we need to confirm that the devices work over larger gaps and address the regulatory requirements,  says Fiona Boissonade, Professor of Neuroscience at Sheffield. The research, published in the journal Biomaterials, was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the Medical Research Council.","Published: March 2, 2015"

Allicin is produced naturally by garlic bulbs to ward off a closely-related group of plant pathogens found in soil and water habitats. Serious infections In the 1980s, the bacteria - known as the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) - emerged as a cause of serious and transmissible lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Measures to limit the spread of infections among people with cystic fibrosis have brought the number of cases down considerably. Current therapies available to treat infections - that are potentially fatal - are limited and require the use of combinations of three to four antibiotics at a time. Killing bacteria Researchers found that allicin - which can be extracted by crushing raw garlic - inhibits the growth of bacteria and, at higher doses, kills the pathogens. The team suggests that allicin kills Bcc bacteria by chemically modifying key enzymes. This deactivates them and halts important biological processes within the pathogens  cells. The team believes allicin-containing remedies could be used in combination with existing antibiotics to treat Bcc infections. Researchers say it is important to pinpoint the mechanisms by which allicin kills the bacteria before the chemical can be incorporated into new treatments. Versatile pathogens The Bcc are highly versatile plant and human pathogens that have not been studied to the same extent as other superbugs, such as MRSA. The bacteria produce potent antimicrobial agents which kill bacteria and fungi, making them naturally drug-resistant and allowing them to survive in polluted and antibiotic-rich environments. The team says the Bcc also have a range of potential uses in the agriculture industry. The study, published in the journal PLoS One, was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.","Published: March 2, 2015"

The worldwide call to academic researchers offers the opportunity to collaborate with MRC Technology s Centre for Therapeutic Discovery (CTD) on target validation and proof of concept prior to initiating a full scale drug discovery project. Interested researchers are asked to visit www.callfortargets.org/respiratory. Through this call MRC Technology aims to identify and accelerate projects focused on validation of potential small molecule or antibody targets, in pathways important in the development or progression of respiratory conditions. Respiratory conditions such as allergy, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis currently affect an estimated 12 million people living in the UK.  The call draws on MRC Technology s expertise in translating novel, promising biology into lead stage therapeutics. Successful projects will benefit from CTD s wealth of experience in assay development, high throughput screening (HTS), medicinal chemistry, antibody engineering and affinity maturation. CTD will also provide academic researchers with access to an in-house small molecule library as well as its core antibody humanisation skills.

The damage doesn t come all at once: There is a  honeymoon  period during which some regeneration of myelin, called remyelination, does occur, but this ability to regenerate dissipates as the disease progresses and the patient ages. Now, a University at Buffalo researcher has discovered a way to keep that kind of remyelination going, using a drug that s already on the market. A paper describing the research results was published in the Journal of Neuroscience.  We have identified a new drug target that promotes stem cell therapy for myelin-based disease, such as MS,  says lead author Fraser J. Sim, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology in the University at Buffalo School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. The study shows it is possible to boost myelination by targeting human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells with solifenacin, an anti-muscarinic drug that currently is approved and marketed to treat overactive bladder.  Our hypothesis is that in MS, the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells seem to get stuck,  Sim explains.  When these cells don t mature properly, they don t differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes.  In the new study, the approach Sim and his colleagues took was to first characterize the molecular pathways that govern the differentiation of human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and then identify drug candidates that would promote differentiation and myelin production. They found that when a muscarinic type 3 receptor on human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells was activated, differentiation was completely blocked.  So we thought, if we had something that blocks instead of activates this receptor, could we boost differentiation?  asks Fraser. To do that, the researchers turned to solifenacin, the anti-muscarinic drug for overactive bladder; the bladder muscle contains several muscarinic receptors.  We were excited about this because solifenacin is an approved drug that s already on the market,  says Sim. To test whether the drug could boost myelin synthesis, the researchers transplanted human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells into mice that could not make myelin. The result was increased differentiation and myelin synthesis from the transplanted human cells. But Sim and his colleagues needed a functional endpoint, a way to know that the myelin being made was being translated into improved behavior or function. So Sim teamed up with Richard J. Salvi, PhD, SUNY Distinguished Professor in the Department of Communicative Disorders and Sciences, and director of UB s Center for Hearing and Deafness. Together, they determined that an auditory brainstem response, which records brain wave activity in response to sounds, would be appropriate. Sim explains that it takes a certain amount of time for a signal to go from the ear to the front of the brain:  So in the readout, you get waves that should have a certain time pattern. When there isn t enough myelin, the signaling slows down. And if you add myelin, you should see the signals speed up.  The tests showed improvement in the response to auditory signals in animals transplanted with the human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells treated with solifenacin.  We have identified a way to improve human myelination,  says Sim. The promising results have prompted Sim and his colleagues to seek funding for a small human trial. The study results are all preclinical and no human testing has been done yet. University at Buffalo   Original reporting by: Ellen Goldbaum Kavitha Abiraman, Suyog U. Pol, Melanie A.

Working with mice, two research teams at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis independently linked the protein to the ability to clear debris from the brain. Such waste builds up both as a byproduct of daily mental activities and as a result of misdirected immune system attacks on brain cells. If too much debris is present in the brain for too long, it can contribute to neurological disease. In one study, appearing in Cell, scientists showed that Alzheimer s brain plaques build up more slowly in mice that have a defective version of the TREM2 protein. In another, published in Acta Neuropathologica, researchers showed that mice lacking the same protein had trouble cleaning up debris in the brain produced by damage to a protective coating on nerve cells. The problem is thought to occur in MS and other neurological disorders.  We ve been very interested in identifying ways to control naturally occurring mechanisms that help clean and repair the brain, and these new studies provide clear evidence that TREM2 could be just such a target,  said Laura Piccio, MD, PhD assistant professor of neurology and senior author of one of the studies. Scientists are looking for ways to activate the protein to slow or prevent  damage caused by neurological disorders. Previous studies have linked rare forms of the TREM2 gene to early-onset dementia and increased risk of Alzheimer s disease, Parkinson s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Scientists knew the protein was found on brain cells called microglia, which help maintain and repair the central nervous system. The new studies are among the first to provide clear evidence that the protein plays an integral role in at least some of these processes. In Alzheimer s disease, amyloid beta, a byproduct of brain metabolism that is normally cleared from the brain, builds up to form plaques. Researchers in the laboratories of Marco Colonna, MD, the Robert Rock Belliveau MD Professor of Pathology, and John Cirrito, PhD, associate professor of neurology, bred mice lacking the gene with mice genetically engineered to have an Alzheimer s-like condition. First author Yaming Wang, PhD, a postdoctoral research scholar, monitored the buildup of amyloid plaques in the mice offspring as they aged and found that the absence of the gene significantly accelerated the accumulation of the plaques.  We found that microglia cluster around amyloid plaques when TREM2 is present, presumably because the cells are getting ready to absorb the plaques and break them down,  said Colonna.  When TREM2 is absent, this clustering does not occur.  In MS, misdirected immune cell attacks damage myelin, a protective coating on nerve cells, leaving myelin fragments in brain tissue. Failure to promptly remove this debris can worsen damage caused by the condition and inhibit repair mechanisms. For the MS study, Piccio and colleagues at the John L. Trotter MS Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital gave a compound called cuprizone to mice that lacked the TREM2 gene. Cuprizone causes loss of myelin in a manner somewhat similar to that seen in people with MS.  When we give normal mice this chemical, they can clear most of the myelin fragments from the brain,  Piccio said.  But when we gave cuprizone to mice that did not have the gene and looked at their brains four, six and 12 weeks later, we could still see evidence of damaged myelin.  Motor coordination in these mice also was significantly more impaired after cuprizone exposure. This may reflect enhanced damage to brain cells resulting from the lingering presence of damaged myelin in the brain. Colonna and his colleagues showed that TREM2 detects molecules associated with amyloid beta and with damaged neurons. They believe that the protein helps keep microglia from self-destructing as debris is cleared from the brain.  This is a mechanism that is very common in immune cells,  he explained.  When a signal activates immune cells and they start attacking an invader or working to repair an injury, they start using energy very rapidly. If the cells do not receive a second signal confirming the need for their services, this increased energy usage will kill them.  Washington University in St. Louis   Original reporting by: Michael C.

Just  shake it off  and move on, as music star Taylor Swift sings. But while that might work for many people, it may not be so easy for those with untreated depression, a new brain study finds. The pain of social rejection lasts longer for them -- and their brain cells release less of a natural pain and stress-reducing chemical called natural opioids, researchers report in the journal Molecular Psychiatry. The findings were made in depressed and non-depressed people using specialized brain-scanning technology and a simulated online dating scenario. The research sheds new light on how the brain s pain-response mechanism, called the opioid system, differs in people with depression. On the flip side, when someone they re interested in likes them back, depressed people do feel relatively better -- but only momentarily. This may also be explained by differences in their opioid system compared to non-depressed people, according to the new results. Further research could lead to a better understanding of how to boost the opioid response in depressed individuals to reduce the exaggerated effect of social stress, and to increase the benefits of positive social interactions. A team from the University of Michigan Medical School, Stony Brook University and the University of Illinois at Chicago worked together on the study, which builds on previous work about social rejection in non-depressed people.  Every day we experience positive and negative social interactions. Our findings suggest that a depressed person s ability to regulate emotions during these interactions is compromised, potentially because of an altered opioid system.  This may be one reason for depression s tendency to linger or return, especially in a negative social environment,  says lead author David Hsu, Ph.D., formerly of U-M and now at Stony Brook.  This builds on our growing understanding that the brain s opioid system may help an individual feel better after negative social interactions, and sustain good feelings after positive social interactions.  The researchers focused on the mu-opioid receptor system in the brain   the same system that they have studied for years in relation to response to physical pain.  During physical pain, our brains release opioids to dampen pain signals. The new work shows that this same system is associated with an individual s ability to withstand social stress   and to positively respond to positive social interactions, says senior author Jon-Kar Zubieta, M.D., Ph.D.  Social stressors are important factors that precipitate or worsen illnesses such as depression, anxiety and other neuropsychiatric conditions. This study examined mechanisms that are involved in the suppression of those stress responses,  he says.  The findings suggest novel potential targets for medication development that directly or indirectly target these circuits, and biological factors that affect variation between individuals in recovery from this otherwise chronic and disabling illness.  Zubieta is a member of U-M s Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute and the U-M Depression Center, and is the Phil F. Jenkins Research Professor of Depression in the Department of Psychiatry. The new findings have already prompted the team to plan follow-up studies to test individuals who are more sensitive to social stress and vulnerable to disorders such as social anxiety and depression, and to test ways of boosting the opioid response.  Of course, everyone responds differently to their social environment,  says Hsu.  To help us understand who is most affected by social stressors, we re planning to investigate the influence of genes, personality, and the environment on the brain s ability to release opioids during rejection and acceptance.  The research used an imaging technique called positron emission tomography, or PET. U-M has a PET scanner devoted to research   and a particle accelerator to make the short-lived radioactive elements that enable PET scans to track specific brain activity. The depressed individuals all met criteria for major depressive disorder, and none was taking medication for the condition. Before having their brains scanned, the 17 depressed participants and 18 similar but non-depressed participants each viewed photos and profiles of hundreds of other adults. Each person selected profiles of people they were most interested in romantically   similar to online dating. During the brain scan, participants were informed that the individuals they found attractive and interesting were not interested in them. PET scans made during these moments of rejection showed both the amount and location of opioid release, measured by looking at the availability of mu-opioid receptors on brain cells. The depressed individuals showed reduced opioid release in brain regions regulating stress, mood and motivation. During social acceptance when participants were informed that people liked them back, both depressed and non-depressed individuals reported feeling happy and accepted. This surprised the researchers, says Hsu, because depression s symptoms often include a dulled response to positive events that should be enjoyable.  However, the positive feeling in depressed individuals disappeared quickly after the period of social acceptance had ended, and may be related to altered opioid responses. But only non-depressed people went on to report feeling motivated to connect socially with other people. That feeling was accompanied by the release of opioids in a brain area called the nucleus accumbens -- a structure involved in reward and positive emotions. The researchers had actually informed participants ahead of time that the  dating  profiles were not real, and neither was the  rejection  or  acceptance.  Nonetheless, the simulated online dating scenario was enough to cause both an emotional and opioid response. Before the end of the visit, staff gave depressed participants information on treatment resources. ""We enrolled almost all of these subjects in a subsequent treatment study   which allows us to capture additional information about how these opioid changes to acceptance and rejection may relate to success or failure of our standard treatments"" says study co-investigator Scott Langenecker, formerly at U-M and now at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  He adds, ""We expect work of this type to highlight different subtypes of depression, where distinct brain systems may be affected in different ways, requiring us to measure and target these networks by developing new and innovative treatments.

The findings could help improve diagnosis and identify treatment options for the disabling disorder, in which symptoms range from extreme fatigue and difficulty concentrating to headaches and muscle pain. These immune signatures represent the first robust physical evidence that ME/CFS is a biological illness as opposed to a psychological disorder, and the first evidence that the disease has distinct stages. Results appear online in the new American Association for the Advancement of Science journal, Science Advances. With funding to support studies of immune and infectious mechanisms of disease from the Chronic Fatigue Initiative of the Hutchins Family Foundation, the researchers used immunoassay testing methods to determine the levels of 51 immune biomarkers in blood plasma samples collected through two multicenter studies that represented a total of 298 ME/CFS patients and 348 healthy controls. They found specific patterns in patients who had the disease three years or less that were not present in controls or in patients who had the disease for more than three years. Short duration patients had increased amounts of many different types of immune molecules called cytokines. The association was unusually strong with a cytokine called interferon gamma that has been linked to the fatigue that follows many viral infections, including Epstein-Barr virus (the cause of infectious mononucleosis). Cytokine levels were not explained by symptom severity. ""We now have evidence confirming what millions of people with this disease already know, that ME/CFS isn't psychological,"" states lead author Mady Hornig, MD, director of translational research at the Center for Infection and Immunity and associate professor of Epidemiology at Columbia's Mailman School. ""Our results should accelerate the process of establishing the diagnosis after individuals first fall ill as well as discovery of new treatment strategies focusing on these early blood markers."" There are already human monoclonal antibodies on the market that can dampen levels of a cytokine called interleukin-17A that is among those the study shows were elevated in early-stage patients. Before any drugs can be tested in a clinical trial, Dr. Hornig and colleagues hope to replicate the current, cross-sectional results in a longitudinal study that follows patients for a year to see how cytokine levels, including interleukin-17A, differ within individual patients over time, depending on how long they have had the disease. The study supports the idea that ME/CFS may reflect an infectious ""hit-and-run"" event. Patients often report getting sick, sometimes from something as common as infectious mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus), and never fully recover. The new research suggests that these infections throw a wrench in the immune system's ability to quiet itself after the acute infection, to return to a homeostatic balance; the immune response becomes like a car stuck in high gear. ""It appears that ME/CFS patients are flush with cytokines until around the three-year mark, at which point the immune system shows evidence of exhaustion and cytokine levels drop,"" says Dr. Hornig. ""Early diagnosis may provide unique opportunities for treatment that likely differ from those that would be appropriate in later phases of the illness."" The investigators went to great lengths to carefully screen participants to make sure they had the disease. The researchers also recruited greater numbers of patients whose diagnosis was of relatively recent onset. Patients' stress levels were standardized; before each blood draw, patients were asked to complete standardized paperwork, in part to engender fatigue. The scientists also controlled for factors known to affect the immune system, including the time of day, season and geographic location where the samples were taken, as well as age, sex and ethnicity/race. In 2012, W. Ian Lipkin, MD, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity, and colleagues reported the results of a multicenter study that definitively ruled out two viruses thought to be implicated in ME/CFS: XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus [MLV]-related virus) and murine retrovirus-like sequences (designated pMLV: polytropic MLV). In the coming weeks, Drs. Hornig and Lipkin expect to report the results of a second study of cerebrospinal fluid from ME/CFS patients. In separate ongoing studies, they are looking for ""molecular footprints"" of the specific agents behind the disease -- be they viral, bacterial, or fungal -- as well as the longitudinal look at how plasma cytokine patterns change within ME/CFS patients and controls across a one-year period, as noted above. ""This study delivers what has eluded us for so long: unequivocal evidence of immunological dysfunction in ME/CFS and diagnostic biomarkers for disease,"" says Dr. Lipkin, senior author of the current study and the John Snow Professor of Epidemiology at Columbia's Mailman School.

The study, which will be conducted in Liberia and the United States, is a randomized controlled trial enrolling adults and children with known Ebola virus infection.  Although ZMapp has been used to treat several Ebola-infected patients in recent months, we cannot determine if the drug actually benefitted those patients because it was not administered within the context of a clinical trial,  said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the NIAID, at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  This clinical trial will help us determine if ZMapp and other treatments are safe and effective for use in the current devastating outbreak in West Africa as well as in future outbreaks.  ZMapp, developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc., based in San Diego, is composed of three different proteins called monoclonal antibodies. ZMapp is designed to prevent the progression of Ebola virus disease within the body by targeting the main surface protein of the Ebola virus. The antibodies comprising ZMapp are produced in tobacco plants specially bioengineered to produce large quantities of these proteins. Studies in nonhuman primates demonstrated that ZMapp has strong antiviral activity and rescued the animals from death as late as five days after infection with Zaire ebolavirus. The drug has not yet been tested in human clinical trials, but was administered under emergency use authorization to nine infected patients in Africa, the United States, and Western Europe. The trial will be led by co-principal investigators Richard T. Davey, Jr., M.D., deputy clinical director of NIAID s Division of Intramural Research, and Moses Massaquoi, M.D., National Chair for Case Management at the Ebola Incident Management System in Monrovia. The trial will enroll adults and children of any age who have been admitted to Ebola treatment units in Liberia, health care workers who were infected with Ebola virus in West Africa and have returned to the United States for treatment, and adults and children who may have acquired Ebola infection in the United States through secondary transmission. All participants will provide informed consent prior to enrollment. Treatment centers in Monrovia, Liberia, will include the ELWA 2 Ebola treatment unit and the Monrovia Medical Unit - staffed by the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service. The NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland will serve as a treatment center in the U.S. Additional trial sites under consideration in the U.S. include the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, and the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska. All participants will receive the optimized standard of care for treating Ebola infection, which includes providing intravenous fluids, balancing electrolytes, maintaining oxygen status and blood pressure and treating other infections if they occur. Participants will then be assigned randomly to one of two groups: the first group, which will act as the control, will continue to receive the current optimized standard of care. The second group will receive the optimized standard of care plus three separate intravenous infusions of ZMapp administered three days apart. The total dose of ZMapp at each infusion will depend on the weight of the participant. Study participants will be monitored up to 30 days following discharge from the hospital and may return for outpatient visits for additional follow up. Researchers designed the study protocol to include a series of two-arm comparisons (the first being ZMapp compared to the current standard of care) to establish a framework to evaluate multiple potential Ebola treatments in the future. If one investigational treatment proves to be statistically more effective, it will then become the basis of the new standard of care against which additional investigational Ebola interventions could be tested and compared. Each experimental therapy will be examined in up to 100 participants per arm. If scientists are unable to establish a significant difference after enrolling 100 participants per arm, then that particular treatment will be declared ineffective and scientists will begin testing the next therapy. These additional treatments may also include the following:   Tekmira siRNA from Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp., based in Burnaby, British Columbia  Favipiravir from Toyama Chemical Co. LTD, based in Tokyo  Convalescent or post-immunization plasma collected from recent Ebola infection survivors. It is possible that this category could potentially be expanded to include plasma donors who have participated in Phase 1 Ebola vaccine clinical trials and whose plasma shows high neutralizing activity against the virus.  BCX4430 from BioCryst, based in Durham, North Carolina  AVI-7537 from Sarepta, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts NIH is collaborating with experts from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis; Leidos Biomedical Research Inc.; Emory University Hospital, Atlanta; the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences; and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to conduct this trial. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is funding the production of ZMapp. The trial is expected to conclude in December 2016. Given the current decline in the number of new Ebola cases in Liberia, study investigators anticipate the need for flexibility in the conduct and design of the trial to address the changing nature of the outbreak in West Africa. Consideration will also be given to other sites in the outbreak region that express interest.","Published: February 28, 2015"

Since they do not have natural enemies in most potato producing regions, farmers try to control them with pesticides. However, this strategy is often ineffective because the pest has developed resistances against nearly all insecticides. Now, scientists from the Max Planck Institutes of Molecular Plant Physiology in Potsdam-Golm and Chemical Ecology in Jena have shown that potato plants can be protected from herbivory using RNA interference (RNAi). They genetically modified plants to enable their chloroplasts to accumulate double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) targeted against essential beetle genes. RNA interference (RNAi) is a type of gene regulation that naturally occurs in eukaryotes. In plants, fungi and insects it also is used for protection against certain viruses. During infection, many viral pathogens transfer their genetic information into the host cells as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Replication of viral RNA leads to high amounts of dsRNA which is recognized by the host s RNAi system and chopped up into smaller RNA fragments, called siRNAs (small interfering RNAs). The cell then uses siRNAs to detect and destroy the foreign RNA. But the RNAi mechanism can also be exploited to knock down any desired gene, by tailoring dsRNA to target the gene's messenger RNA (mRNA). When the targeted mRNA is destroyed, synthesis of the encoded protein will be diminished or blocked completely. Targeting an essential gene of a crop pest can turn dsRNA into a precise and potent insecticide. Some crop plants have recently been engineered by modifying their nuclear genomes to produce dsRNA against certain insects.  This never resulted in full protection from herbivory , says Ralph Bock of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology,  because the plant's own RNAi system prevents the accumulation of sufficient amounts of dsRNA. We wanted to circumvent this problem by producing dsRNA in the chloroplasts instead . These organelles, which perform photosynthesis in green plants, are descendants of formerly free-living cyanobacteria, which are prokaryotes that lack an RNAi system. Presuming that chloroplasts would accumulate high amounts of dsRNA, the scientists in Ralph Bock's group decided to generate so-called transplastomic plants. In such plants, the chloroplast genome is the target of genetic modification instead of the nuclear genome. To test this system on a real insect pest, the scientists chose the Colorado potato beetle. This little striped beetle was introduced into Europe accidentally at the end of the 19th century. Nowadays, it is a worldwide pest and can cause massive damage in agriculture. Besides potato leaves the adult beetle and its larvae also feed on other nightshade crops, like tomato, bell pepper and tobacco. The pest is difficult to control because of the widespread occurrence of insecticide resistance.  By using chloroplast transformation we generated potato plants that accumulate high amounts of long stable dsRNAs targeting essential genes in the beetle , says Ralph Bock. The efficacy of the dsRNAs as an insecticide was tested at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena. Larvae were fed on detached potato leaves and the mortality was monitored for nine days. The leaves were taken from transplastomic dsRNA plants, conventional transgenic dsRNA plants with a modified nuclear genome, and unmodified plants. For comparison, dsRNAs targeting two different genes were tested.  Transplastomic leaves producing dsRNA against the actin gene caused a mortality rate of 100% after five days of feeding , says Sher Afzal Khan from Jena. The actin gene encodes a structural protein that is essential for cell integrity. In contrast, plants with a modified nuclear genome expressed much less dsRNA and only slightly slowed down the beetles' growth. These recent results show that changing the target of transformation from the nuclear genome to the chloroplast genome overcomes the major hurdle towards exploiting RNAi for crop protection. As many insect pests increasingly develop resistances against chemical pesticides and Bt toxins, RNAi represents a promising strategy for pest control. This technology allows for precise protection without chemicals and without production of foreign proteins in the plant.","Published: February 28, 2015"

The contribution builds on a 2011 grant of $1.56 million to secure equipment for stem cell research at Yale and includes new funding that will strengthen collaborations between Yale and China s Shantou University. One of the fastest growing areas of biomedical science, stem cell research demands the very latest instrumentation and training. Since 2006, Lin has developed the Yale Stem Cell Center as both an incubator for scientific discovery and a training ground for new investigators.  The Yale Stem Cell Center offers a platform where both scientists and clinicians can ask important questions about stem cells and human health,  Lin said.  Continuing support from the Li Ka Shing Foundation will allow us to accelerate the pace and broaden the scope of our work.  Mr. Li said,  Training side-by-side with leading scientists in stem cell research will be a transformative experience for the students and faculty at Shantou University Medical College, and I want to express my heart-felt appreciation to Professor Haifan Lin and the YSCC for this amazing opportunity.  Advances in stem cell science can offer basic insights into human development and the promise of new treatments for physical trauma, degenerative conditions, and genetic diseases. Because this research requires specialized instrumentation and expertise beyond what can be afforded by individual investigators, Lin has organized the Yale Stem Cell Center around four core laboratories that serve more than 80 Yale faculty members, along with researchers from other regional institutions.  In the Yale Stem Cell Center, Haifan Lin has developed an approach to collaborative research that truly serves as a model for universities and institutes around the country,  said Robert J. Alpern, dean and the Ensign Professor at Yale School of Medicine.  By sharing resources, laboratory techniques, and insights into how stem cells function, Haifan and his colleagues opened the door to discoveries that otherwise may not have been possible, for both basic science and clinical applications.  The new round of funding from LKSF will enable Yale investigators to purchase additional equipment to facilitate their research. This instrumentation will also support collaborations with scientists and clinicians in U.S. institutions such as the University of Connecticut Stem Cell Institute, the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and St. Jude Children s Research Hospital. Such exchanges can deepen our basic understanding of stem cell biology and help to translate today s technological breakthroughs into tomorrow s personalized treatments and cures. The grant also continues and expands the Yale Stem Cell Center s partnership with Shantou University, a key comprehensive university established through a public-private partnership between the Ministry of Education of Guangdong Province and the Li Ka Shing Foundation.  Yale is enormously grateful to Li Ka Shing Foundation for its continued support of basic science, translational research, and scholarly exchange,  said Carolyn Slayman, Sterling Professor of Genetics, professor of cellular and molecular physiology, and deputy dean for academic & scientific affairs.

The online tools will complement remote sensing of cyanobacteria outbreaks. Data from social media sites and the project website, cyanotracker.uga.edu, will be compiled, checked against sensor data or investigated further and used to alert local authorities about harmful algal blooms. The project is a collaboration between three researchers in the UGA Franklin College of Arts and Sciences: Lakshmish Ramaswamy and Suchendra Bhandarkar in the department of computer science and Deepak Mishra in the department of geography. The three combine their individual expertise in intensive computing, hyperspectral sensing, image processing and data mining to develop a new approach to an acute environmental problem involving Georgia's inland waterways. ""Cloud computing has been all the rage recently, and the idea here is the data can be captured locally but shared globally, stored in the cloud and made accessible to everyone,"" Ramaswamy said. ""We are integrating the community cloud, the sensor cloud and the multimedia cloud for interactive, sustainable management of lakes."" ""The idea is to use citizen participation to capture the initiation of these harmful algal blooms, which can be very dangerous to humans and cattle and even pets,"" Mishra explained. ""The cyano bloom that affected communities around Lake Erie could happen here, so rapid continuous monitoring using community-driven, crowdsourcing, social network-triggered data capture is the idea. You can think of it as a neighborhood watch system for Georgia waters."" The research team completed a pilot study of the project with a seed grant from the Franklin College and the UGA Office of the Vice President for Research. The current project was funded by the National Science Foundation' CyberSEES program. ""Residents, recreational visitors, athletes, anyone in the vicinity of lakes or ponds can just take a photo with their smart phone and upload to Facebook (on the CyanoTRACKER page) or Tweet with the hashtag #cyanotracker,"" Bhandarkar said. Data uploaded to social media will be mined and analyzed by algorithms developed by the researchers, which will allow the team to use hyperspectral sensing to examine the instances of harmful algal blooms around the state more closely. ""As the owner and operator of nearly 60,000 acres of significant lakes that enable hydropower production as well as provide other uses to the public including contact recreation, fishing and drinking water supply, Georgia Power Company has a particular interest in cyanobacteria monitoring,"" said Tony Dodd, environmental specialist with Georgia Power Company, which provided a letter in support of the project. ""The periodic occurrence of potentially harmful algal blooms along with increasing population growth and land-use pressures presents new lake management challenges for Georgia Power, regulatory agencies and the surrounding communities."" In addition to recreation, six lakes in Georgia plus Lake Harding in Alabama supply drinking water for Georgians. Neither state or nor federal regulations exist to provide protection due to harmful algal blooms. ""We believe that deploying sensors for high frequency data acquisition and utilizing social-network-based crowdsourcing methods to detect the bloom initiation, development and growth can provide extremely valuable information and aid in the development of a harmful algal bloom forecasting model,"" Bhandarkar said. As a lead up to the summer months when blooms occur, the UGA team will solicit participation from community members across the state through a public information campaign. ""It is of great importance to let the public know how they can play a part in this monitoring process and help protect the lakes and waterways they enjoy so immensely,"" Ramasway said.","Published: February 28, 2015"

They describe their findings in a paper published recently in Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters. Nine million people contracted tuberculosis in 2013, and 1.5 million died from the disease, according to the World Health Organization. While standard anti-TB drugs can cure most people of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, improper use of antibiotics has led to new strains of the bacterium resistant to the two most powerful medications, isoniazid and rifampicin. ""Multi-drug resistant TB is spreading rapidly in many parts of the world,"" said Vasu Nair, Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Drug Discovery in the UGA College of Pharmacy and lead author of the paper. ""There is a tremendous need for new therapies, and we think our laboratory has developed a strong candidate that disrupts fundamental steps in the bacterium's reproduction process."" Just like other living organisms, the genetic information contained in M. tuberculosis undergoes a complex process known as transcription in which the bacterial enzyme, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, or RNAP, produces TB RNA. This molecule is involved in processes that produce critical bacterial proteins that the organism needs to survive. The compound Nair and his colleagues developed works by binding to magnesium and specific amino acids found within the bacterium, interrupting the production of RNA. ""The compound we developed strongly inhibits the growth of the bacterium and renders it incapable of reproducing and spreading infection,"" said Nair. ""More importantly, the compound shows very low levels of cytotoxicity, which means that it is not harmful to the body."" The research team members also performed extensive studies to determine if their newly developed compound had an appropriately long half-life and could be cleared from the body through normal biochemical mechanisms. ""All our tests were very favorable,"" Nair said. ""The half-life is a little over 14 hours, and all traces of the drug are expected to be cleared through normal bodily functions."" While Nair and his colleagues were pleased with their new compound, they were surprised to discover through preliminary experiments that it also exhibited strong anti-HIV properties, opening the door for dual therapeutic applications. A dual-purpose drug would be a windfall for clinicians, because the risk for developing TB is between 26 and 31 times greater in people living with HIV than those without HIV infection, according to the WHO. ""This discovery of dual activity against both retroviruses and drug-resistant gram-positive bacteria is unique and opens a new chapter in drug discovery in this area,"" Nair said. Innovation Gateway, UGA's technology licensing office, is seeking commercial partners to help develop this drug. A license would include humanitarian licensing terms to help ensure access to the drug by people in need at an affordable cost.","Published: February 28, 2015"

This technique will make it possible to collect data on previously intractable samples and will expand the scope of what is now possible with X-ray crystallography.  X-ray crystallography has the capability to characterize the atomic-level details of molecules and complex structures. It enables discoveries in virtually all fields of chemistry, biology, and medicine,  said Tony Jun Huang, professor of engineering science and mechanics at Penn State.  But the biggest issue today with the technique is finding a way to handle these small and delicate crystals.  Recent advances in modern X-ray sources and detector technology have made it possible to collect usable data on these tiny crystals. But the manipulation and mounting of crystals in the beam has traditionally been done by hand under a microscope with small needle-like cryoloops. This process is not only slow and inefficient, but is extremely difficult or impossible for very small crystals.  The lack of robust, automated sample handling techniques prevents crystallographers from fully realizing the power of these technological advances. Our new device, which enables the precise manipulation and patterning of protein crystals using surface acoustic waves, is a transformative technology for structural biologists,  said Jarrod French, an assistant professor of biochemistry and cell biology at Stony Brook University.  This acoustic tweezers technology is a significant boon to the field of X-ray crystallography. It overcomes a significant barrier in the field by enabling the manipulation and patterning of micro- or nanometer sized protein crystals using low power, biocompatible acoustic waves.  French and Huang s collaboration began while French was a postdoctoral scholar in the lab of Stephen Benkovic, Evan Pugh Professor of Chemistry at Penn State. The pair are corresponding authors on a paper appearing online on Feb 2 in the journal Small titled  Precise Manipulation and Patterning of Protein Crystals for Macromolecular Crystallography Using Surface Acoustic Waves.  The lead author is Feng Guo, a Ph.D. student in Huang s group. Neela Yennawar, director of the Huck Institute s Macromolecular X-ray Facility at Penn State and a co-author on the paper in Small, said  Crystallographers are pushing the boundary of biological samples being studied and moving towards more difficult targets of higher molecular weight and complexity. Acoustic tweezers will be extremely important to handle nano sized and fragile crystals of such targets. It will maximize the quality and quantity of X-ray diffraction data collected using the recently established femtosecond serial crystallography approach. This exciting field often requires vast quantities of crystals owing to the low efficiency (hit-rate) of the crystal delivery system to the X-ray beam. Acoustic methods developed in our paper promise to significantly increase the efficiency and throughput of both serial crystallography methods as well as the more conventional screening and data collection approaches.  Acoustic tweezers is a microfluidic device that utilizes ultrasound waves produced by piezoelectric transducers to gently and precisely position biological samples without damage. The device has been used to separate different blood components, to separate cancer cells from blood and to manipulate nanorod motors inside living cells, to name only a few research areas.","Published: February 28, 2015"

Back in 2007, Anson Lowe, an associate professor of medicine, was working with Patrick O. Brown, then a professor of biochemistry, to find genes that are active in pancreatic tumors. Lowe was concerned about the lack of effective therapies for people with pancreatic cancer and hoped that by finding genes that are active in those tumors he could help to develop drugs that could block the gene's activity and thus stop the cancer. In their initial experiment, the group found a gene that was often active in cells taken from pancreatic tumors, but not in normal pancreatic tissue. They and others later found that same gene in tumors in the lung, prostate, ovary, breast and elsewhere. ""It was clearly present in many different human cancers, probably around 70-80 percent of human solid tumors,"" Lowe said. Any drug he developed based on this discovery in pancreatic tumors might be effective in all of those different cancers. ""I hope this will be an example of something we can take all the way to people,"" Lowe said. The gene Lowe and his team had identified turned out to make a protein called AGR2, which was well-known to scientists for the role it plays in the developing embryo and also in wound healing. The group wiped out AGR2 from cancerous cells in a lab dish and those cells essentially stopped dividing. This left Lowe with two major questions: What exactly is AGR2 doing in cancerous cells? Is it possible to develop a drug that would re-create those cancer-halting effects in people? The first answer Last week, Lowe and his team published a paper in the Journal of Biological Chemistry  answering the first question. They show that AGR2 serves as the gatekeeper for a well-known cancer bad guy, called EGFR, which is commonly found on the surface of cancer cells. EGFR responds to signals in the environment and prompts the cell to keep growing and dividing. Several cancer therapies block the activity of EGFR and its relatives, preventing it from spurring the cancer on. If AGR2 regulates EGFR, it made sense that it would play an important role in cancer growth. ""We were excited on the one hand when we realized we hit pay dirt, but it is not a field we were in,"" Lowe said. The team had to quickly get up to speed on the 27,000 published papers describing the role of EGFR in cancer. One thing those papers had in common was a focus on the protein's role on the cell surface. But all proteins on the surface wind their way up to the outer membrane though a maze-like network of tubes within the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum. Within this structure, other proteins groom and ready those that are destined for the surface. Lowe and his team, which included Aiwen Dong, a research associate, and Dariusz Wodziak, a research assistant, showed that AGR2 is responsible for grooming EGFR for its debut on the cell surface. When AGR2 is missing from the endoplasmic reticulum, as in most normal cells, EGFR never makes it to the surface and can't cast its cancerous signals. If AGR2 is inappropriately present, as in tumor cells, EGFR makes its way to the surface where it promotes tumor growth. Lowe thought that if he could make a drug that prevents AGR2 from doing its job, then EGFR would remain stuck in the endoplasmic reticulum (where it would eventually be destroyed) and wouldn't be available to trigger the cell to keep dividing. The art of making a drug Having figured out what AGR2 does, Lowe was faced with the second question, that of whether a drug could block its activity. Many medical research stories end with a hopeful promise of future drugs, but developing those drugs is outside the skillset of most biologists. Lowe took his idea to drug companies, who do have the skills needed to develop drugs, but they were reluctant to devote resources until there was more data to show that an investment would pay off. Can a drug reach proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum? Can it block just AGR2 and not other, closely related proteins doing essential work? They wanted some initial answers before taking on the project. This is where Chaitan Khosla, director of Stanford ChEM-H and professor of chemistry, entered the story. When he founded ChEM-H in 2013 as a new interdisciplinary institute on campus, he wanted to bring chemical expertise to bear on problems of human health. He started a medicinal chemistry program within ChEM-H and hired Mark Smith, who has had more than a decade of experience developing drugs at Roche, to run it. ""The medicinal chemistry program fills a void we had at Stanford,"" Lowe said. He calls the act of creating a new drug an art. We are all so used to taking pills for headaches, allergies and infections that we forget how amazing it is that any drug produces results. The chemical in the pill we swallow has to survive the burbling acidic soup of our stomachs and the digestive enzymes capable of reducing steak and potatoes into tiny particles. Once in our bloodstream, a potential drug has to endure the liver's attempts to detoxify it, and then reach the cell in question and   the hardest part   actually work. Smith said the researchers are in the early stages of finding a drug to block AGR2. ""We want to make sure that we develop a compound that is both potent and selective for AGR2 and that can be taken orally,"" Smith said. If Lowe and Smith are successful in finding a good drug candidate, Lowe said that additional resources exist at Stanford to help them move on to the next step. For example, SPARK, directed by Daria Mochly-Rosen, the George D. Smith professor in translational medicine, helps faculty navigate the process of translating drug candidates into therapies that are available to help people. That last step   helping people   is what drove Lowe to start this research almost a decade ago.  ","Published: February 27, 2015"

The striatum is part of the basal ganglia, the inner core of the brain that processes decisions and movements. Neuroscientists have thought the three regions of the striatum - ventral, dorsomedial and dorsolateral - have very distinct roles in motivation, adaptive decisions and routine actions, respectively. However, OIST researchers found these parts do not operate in isolation, but work together in a coordinated hierarchy - like a traditional company with executives making decisions, delegating to middle managers and employees carrying out specific tasks. ""The three parts have not been investigated simultaneously in the same task before,"" said Dr. Mokoto Ito, a researcher in OIST's Neural Computation Unit and lead paper author. ""We found the different parts work for the same behaviors, but in different roles."" Their findings have been published online in The Journal of Neuroscience. To observe what each part does, the researchers hooked up tiny electrodes to rats' brains. The electrodes measured how frequently neurons in each section fired during a task, in which rats picked between two holes based on the probability of getting a sugar pellet reward. During fixed trials, the reward probability was held at different rates for the two holes, so the rats' responses would become habitual over several weeks. During free-choice trials, the probability of reward jumped around, requiring the rats to adapt and evaluate their options more carefully. The researchers found that while the three striatum regions have distinct roles, they work together in different phases in a trial. ""They do not work for separate behaviors,"" said Prof. Kenji Doya, who heads OIST's Neural Computation Unit and paper co-author. ""It's probably better to understand these different parts from a hierarchical control viewpoint."" The ventral striatum (VS) was most active early on, when the rat decided whether it would participate in the activity or not. The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) changed firing levels as the rat evaluated the expected reward for each option while making a decision to turn left or right. The dorsolateral striatum (DLS) fired short bursts at a variety of times throughout the task, suggesting the involvement with the control of fine motor movements. This is akin to a company's president deciding to make a new product, middle managers evaluating different design and sales options, and employees building specific parts. Neuroscientists have long thought there are separate circuits for routine actions and actions in continuously changing environments. If true, the DLS would be more active if the probability is fixed, while the DMS would be more active in free-choice tasks that require the rat to learn and adapt. To the researchers' surprise, there was little difference in DMS and DLS firing during fixed and free-choice tasks in this study. That was not the only unexpected result. OIST's Neural Computation Unit works on adaptive robots learning how to autonomously behave based on reward feedback. The core component of the robots' algorithm is the ""action value,"" which keeps track of the probability for a positive outcome. ""The same variable we use for robot learning was also found in the rat's brain,"" Doya said. ""This is quite a striking observation."" This strongly suggests rats analyzed the potential benefit of choosing the left or right hole, and that analysis was constantly updated after each trial - the same way the robot algorithm works.

Some say you can tell by the shape of a woman s bump, or whether she craves salty or sweet. Even ultrasound doesn t always get it right. But for lemurs, the answer is in the mother s scent. Duke University researchers report in the Feb. 25 issue of the journal Biology Letters that lemur moms carrying boys smell different from those carrying girls. The results represent the first evidence in any animal species that a pregnant mother s scent differs depending on the sex of her baby, said Christine Drea, a professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke. Drea and co-author Jeremy Chase Crawford of the University of California, Berkeley used cotton swabs to collect scent secretions from the genital regions of 12 female ringtailed lemurs at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, North Carolina, before and during pregnancy. Cat-sized primates with long black-and-white striped tails, ringtailed lemurs produce a musky odor that researchers jokingly refer to as  eau de lemur.  The distinctive scent is a complex cocktail of pheromones and other chemicals that have been shown by previous studies to convey information about an animal s sex, fertility, and other qualities. In this latest study, chemical analysis using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed that the hundreds of ingredients that make up each female s scent change during pregnancy. Expectant lemur moms give off simpler scents that contain fewer odor compounds compared with their pre-pregnancy bouquet -- a change that is more pronounced when the moms are carrying boys, Drea said. The patterns correlate with changes in blood hormone levels, the researchers found. Drea said hormones change dramatically during pregnancy, and girls and boys affect their mothers  hormones differently.  The difference in hormone profiles between pregnant lemurs carrying sons and those carrying daughters is dramatic,  she said. The researchers don t yet know why pregnant lemurs produce simpler scents, particularly when they re carrying sons.  It could be that producing these compounds uses resources that are directed elsewhere when they re pregnant, especially if it s more energetically costly for a female to have a male pregnancy than a female pregnancy,  Drea said.","Published: February 27, 2015"

The goal of the study is to determine the bioequivalency of the two iron medications because some concerns exist about differences in the safety of the brand and generic versions. Sarah Michel, PhD, an associate professor in PSC, will lead the study, which includes an 18-month clinical trial with 48 healthy volunteers and research on the blood samples collected from the volunteers.  Patients who suffer from chronic kidney disease tend to develop anemia that is often treated with IV injections of iron complexes or iron drugs,  she says.  There are both a brand name and a generic drug approved by the FDA to treat this anemia, but there is some concern following a study done in Europe about the potential toxic effects of the generic because of iron overload. Through our study, we hope to answer the question about whether or not the brand and generic drugs have the same effect when they are administered to patients. To do this, we will examine each drug s formulation, how the drugs impact the distribution of iron in the plasma, and whether they produce iron overload, which can be detrimental to patients.  Michel, who is a bioinorganic chemist (studies metal ions), has teamed with Maureen Kane, PhD, an assistant professor in PSC with expertise in mass spectrometry; James Polli, PhD, the Noxell/Shangraw Endowed Chair in Pharmaceutics within PSC who has expertise in bioequivalency studies and clinical trial design; and Angela Wilks, PhD, a professor in PSC who researches mechanisms by which bacterial pathogens acquire and utilize hemoglobin as an iron source. They will be joined by Tricia Ting, MD, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who will serve as the study s medical officer. According to Michel, the iron from the drug is initially bound to a protein in the body called transferrin. When there is too much iron in the body (overload), it runs out of transferrin protein to bind to and the remaining iron floats free causing oxidative damage, which can result in a myriad of diseases ranging from inflammation to arthritis and cancer. In order to evaluate the safety of the generic versus the brand iron medication in question and to understand the potential impact of iron overload, the research team will use various methods to analyze the blood samples collected from the study volunteers.  My lab s expertise is in understanding metal ions like iron,  says Michel.  We will use inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry coupled to high performance liquid chromatography to measure the total iron levels and identify the proteins that the iron is binding to in the samples we collect.  Kane, who is co-director of the School s Mass Spectrometry Center, will use instrumentation in the Center to measure biomarkers of oxidative damage that might occur as a result of iron overload while Wilks will use biochemical approaches to study other cellular markers of oxidative damage. The team will also examine the formulation of each drug to determine how their formulations may impact the distribution of iron in the plasma upon administration of the medication.  The beauty of this study is the use of advanced chemical, biochemical, toxicologic, and nanoparticulate laboratory methods that Drs. Michel, Kane, and Wilks are developing to evaluate if the generic is as safe as the brand medication being tested,  says Polli, who will work with Ting on the clinical trial design.  In fact, scientists from prestigious institutions in Europe are visiting during the study to learn about these advanced methods and our study design.   This project has the potential to significantly improve the lives of patients who suffer from anemia as a result of chronic kidney disease,  says Andrew Coop, PhD, professor and chair of PSC.  Securing a grant of this nature from the FDA is a testament to the expertise of the department s faculty who span the drug discovery and development spectrum, from biochemistry to clinical trials. I m proud of the collaborative spirit that exists in our department and within the School of Pharmacy that makes it possible to translate basic science findings to clinical practice.   My hope for this study is that we identify benchmarks for how much of the generic versus the brand name drug to deliver to anemia patients and what the effects will be,  says Michel.  It might be a matter of changing the dosage or better monitoring the patient during treatment of the IV iron medication. ","Published: February 27, 2015"

The new molecule binds to the sticky part of  -synuclein, stopping it from clumping and killing brain cells. Dr Jody Mason, from the Department of Biology & Biochemistry, explained:  If you think of the misshapen  -synuclein proteins as Lego bricks which stack to form a tower; our peptide acts like a smooth brick that sticks to the  -synuclein and stops the tower from growing any bigger.  This research is in the early stages, but the results so far are very encouraging. We still need to overcome many obstacles before this can be developed into a drug treatment, but these findings could herald a new approach to treating Parkinson s.  An incurable disease Parkinson s affects around 1 in 500 people in the UK. It s a progressive neurological condition where brain cells die causing a lack of the chemical dopamine, which acts as a messenger that coordinates movement. Parkinson s causes symptoms of tremor, rigidity and slowness of movement. The research team led by Bath designed the 10 amino-acid peptide molecule by screening a library of peptides based on the region of  -synuclein that is mutated in patients with early onset Parkinson s. This is the first time that this part of the  -synuclein protein has been explored as a potential drug target. The study, published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, showed that the molecule stopped  -synuclein clumping in living cells in the lab. The team anticipates that if developed into a treatment, the peptide could help slow the progression of this degenerative disease. The researchers next hope to test the peptide in mammalian neurone cells and then develop it into a drug that is effective in humans.  We need more successes, like this one"" Co-author Dr Neil Kad, from the University of Kent, added:  This Parkinson s UK funded work shows how investment in basic science can open up new ways of studying and ultimately treating neurodegenerative disease.  Dr Arthur Roach, Director of Research and Development at Parkinson s UK, which funded the study, said:  It s a difficult task to develop treatments that can stop the toxic build-up of proteins in the brains of people with Parkinson s. Supporting this kind of innovative research approach is starting to make imaginable today what seemed impossible a decade ago.  We need more successes, like this one, if we are to develop drugs that could actually slow or stop the progression of Parkinson s. At the moment no drugs are capable of doing this.

Canbex is a spin-off of University College London (UCL) that raised a Series A financing of $3.2 million in 2013 from MS Ventures (the corporate venture arm of Merck Serono, Merck KGaA), the Wellcome Trust and UCL Business Plc. VSN16R is a novel, orally active small molecule compound intended for the treatment of spasticity in MS and other disorders. Preclinical and Phase I clinical studies have demonstrated that VSN16R has the potential to provide substantially better patient care than existing systemic anti-spastic treatments. Spasticity is a debilitating and painful symptom of MS that consists of involuntary spasms of limbs and torso musculature. With VSN16R, Canbex aims to set a new standard in the treatment of spasticity, and to improve the lives of people worldwide with this serious and incurable disorder. VSN16R was shown to be safe and well tolerated in its Phase I clinical safety trial.  In the Phase I study, 72 healthy volunteers were enrolled in a placebo-controlled, single ascending- and multiple-ascending dose design. Marc de Garidel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen stated:  Ipsen is delighted to enter into a partnership with the UK biotech company Canbex. Their lead compound has demonstrated excellent safety, efficacy and tolerability to date and fits well within our neurology franchise. Indeed, it could be a valuable companion product to Dysport  in the treatment of spasticity. The agreement with Canbex also reflects our ambition to maintain our business development efforts to complement organic growth.  Dr Keith Powell, Chairman of Canbex commented:  Canbex is excited to be working with Ipsen, because of its leading expertise in spasticity and its commitment to providing better treatments. Ipsen is excellently placed to help bring our promising new medication to patients in this important and poorly served medical need.  Under the financial terms of the agreement, Ipsen has paid an option fee of  6 million ($6.8 million) to Canbex.

The latest workshop took place at the end of January at Renishaw's headquarters at New Mills, Wotton-under-Edge, UK. Other workshops are planned to take place throughout the world. An audience of spectroscopists and microscopists recently attended the joint workshop designed to illustrate how to make tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy more accessible to users. Four talks on the techniques, backed by various applications examples, preceded an afternoon of demonstrations of the latest instrumentation given by applications specialists from co-hosts, Renishaw and Bruker Nano Surfaces Division. The first invited talk came from Aravind Vijayaraghavan from the National Graphene Centre in Manchester. Graphene and other similar 2D materials are well suited to characterization by both Raman and Atomic Force Micorscopy (AFM). Dr Vijayaraghavan's research looks at the integration of nano-carbons with plasmonic and photonic systems. In particular, he pointed out the use of Raman to follow the strain processes in graphene and how polarization could be used to assist in his measurement of the efficiency of plasmonic antennae. Next was a well-delivered description of the recent advances in the integration of AFM and Raman by Tim Batten (Renishaw). This talk stressed the value of combining the two techniques with Raman providing information on sample giving the chemistry to complement the nanoscale physical property measurements delivered by AFM. The second of the invited talks was given by Claus Burkhardt from the Natural & Medical Sciences Institute at the University of T bingen, Germany. Dr Burkhardt leads a team developing new implants to aid the blind and deaf. The Institute has successfully developed an intelligent retina implant and is now working on a cochlea implant. Central to these micro-implants are the arrays of electrodes. In the encapsulation process, AFM, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Raman are used to check successive deposition and removal processes. The talks were completed with more applications examples from Mickael Febvre (Bruker Nano). Particular attention was given to the choice of different tips for TERS applications. The choice of experimental parameters for measurements can greatly affect resultant imaging and spectra. For example, tip height when in feedback and polarization dependency.","Published: February 27, 2015"

Unfortunately, specialists in psychology and communication disorders do not always communicate the latest science so well. These factors make the autism community especially vulnerable to interventions and ""therapies"" that have been thoroughly discredited, says Scott Lilienfeld, a psychologist at Emory University. ""Hope is a great thing, I'm a strong believer in it,"" Lilienfeld says. ""But the false hope buoyed by discredited therapies can be cruel, and it may prevent people from trying an intervention that actually could deliver benefits."" Lilienfeld is lead author of a commentary, ""The persistence of fad interventions in the face of negative scientific evidence: Facilitated communication for autism as a case example,"" published by the journal Evidence-Based Communication Assessment and Intervention. Co-authors of the commentary are Julia Marshall (also from Emory) and psychologists James Todd (from Eastern Michigan University), and Howard Shane (director of the Autism Language Program at Boston Children's Hospital). The authors describe a litany of treatments for autism that have been attempted with little or no success over the years, including gluten- and casein-free diets, antifungal interventions, chelation therapy, magnetic shoe inserts, hyperbaric oxygen sessions, weighted vests, bleach enemas, sheep-stem-cell injections and many more. As a case study, however, the article focuses on one intervention in particular: Facilitated Communication, or FC. FC purports to allow previously nonverbal individuals with autism and related disorders to type by using a keyboard or letter pad. A facilitator offers support to the individual's arms, allowing him or her to type words and complete sentences. Soon after its introduction into the United States in the early 1990s, however, FC was convincingly debunked. Studies overwhelmingly demonstrated that facilitators were unconsciously guiding the hands of individuals with autism toward the desired letters, much as individuals using a Ouija board unknowingly guide the planchette to certain numbers and letters. ""The emotional appeal of FC is very powerful and understandable,"" Lilienfeld says. ""And no doubt the overwhelming majority of people who use FC are sincere and well-meaning. The problem is, it doesn't work."" In some cases, the authors note, FC has resurfaced with minor variations in the technique and a new name, such as ""rapid prompting,"" or ""supported typing."" By reviewing published surveys of practitioner use and canvassing the popular and academic literatures, Lilienfeld and his co-authors show that FC continues to be widely used and widely disseminated in much of the autism community despite its scientific refutation. They examine a number of potential reasons for the surprising persistence of FC and other autism fads. They note that the inherent difficulties in treating autism may give rise to an understandable desire for quick fixes of many kinds. Lilienfeld and his colleagues underscore the pressing need for experts in the autism field to better educate the public about not only what works for the condition, but what does not.

Caffeine intake has been associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson s and Alzheimer s diseases, and our study shows that coffee intake may also protect against MS, supporting the idea that the drug may have protective effects for the brain,  said study author Ellen Mowry, MD, MCR, with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. For the study, researchers looked at a Swedish study of 1,629 people with MS and 2,807 healthy people, and a U.S. study of 1,159 people with MS and 1,172 healthy people. The studies characterized coffee consumption among persons with MS one and five years before MS symptoms began (as well as 10 years before MS symptoms began in the Swedish study) and compared it to coffee consumption of people who did not have MS at similar time periods. The study also accounted for other factors such as age, sex, smoking, body mass index, and sun exposure habits. The Swedish study found that compared to people who drank at least six cups of coffee per day during the year before symptoms appeared, those who did not drink coffee had about a one and a half times increased risk of developing MS. Drinking large amounts of coffee five or 10 years before symptoms started was similarly protective. In the US study, people who didn t drink coffee were also about one and a half times more likely to develop the disease than those who drank four or more cups of coffee per day in the year before symptoms started to develop the disease. Caffeine should be studied for its impact on relapses and long-term disability in MS as well,  said Mowry. American Academy of Neurology (AAN)   press release","Published: February 26, 2015"

But a new study from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) has found that a specific type of neuron might be thwarting their efforts at mapping the connectome by temporarily cloaking the synapses that link a wide field of neurons. If you re a Star Trek fan, think of it as a Romulan or Klingon cloaking device, which hides a warship. The cloaked ship is invisible, until it fires at an enemy. In the study published in the March 16 issue of Current Biology, the researchers found that a class of inhibitory neurons, called somatostatin cells, send out a signal   much like a cloaking device   that silences neighboring excitatory neurons. Synapses, like a cloaked warship, can t be seen if they aren t firing; activating the somatostatin cells makes the synapses and local network of neurons invisible to researchers. Furthermore, by silencing certain parts of the neuronal network, the activity of the somatostatin neurons also can change the way the brain functions, heightening some perceptual pathways and silencing others.  It was totally unexpected that these cells would work this way,  said Alison Barth, professor of biological sciences and a member of BrainHubSM, Carnegie Mellon s neuroscience research initiative.  Changing the activity of just this one cell type can let you change the brain s circuit structure at will. This could dramatically change how we look at   and use   the connectome.  The Carnegie Mellon researchers discovered this synaptic cloaking device, much in the same way Starfleet would detect a cloaked Klingon warship   they were conducting their normal research and noticed that something just didn t look quite right. Joanna Urban-Ciecko, a research scientist in Barth s lab, noticed that the synapses in her experiments were not behaving the way that previous experimenters had reported. Prior studies reported that the synapses should be strong and reliable, and that they should always grow and strengthen in response to a stimulus. But the neurons Urban-Ciecko looked at were weak and unreliable. The difference between Urban-Ciecko s research and the previously completed work was that her research was being done under real-life conditions. Prior research on synapse function was done under conditions optimized for observing synapses. However, such experimental conditions don t reflect the noisy brain environment in which synapses normally exist.  There s this big black box in neuroscience. We know how to make synapses stronger in a dish. But what s going on in the brain to initiate synaptic strengthening in real life?  Barth asked. To find out, Urban-Ciecko looked at neurons in the brain s neocortex that were functioning under normal, noisy conditions. She took paired-cell recordings from pyramidal cells, a type of excitatory neuron, and found that many of the synapses between the neurons were not functioning, or functioning at an unexpectedly low level. Urban-Ciecko then recorded the activity of somatostatin cells, a type of inhibitory neuron, and found that those neurons were much more active than expected.  The somatostatin cells were so active, I wondered if they could possibly be driving the inhibition of synapses,  Urban-Ciecko said. To test her hypothesis, Urban-Ciecko turned to optogenetics, a technique that controls neurons with light. She used light to trigger an enzyme that activated and deactivated the somatostatin neuron. When the somatostatin cells were turned off, synapses grew big and strong. When the cells were turned on, the synapses became weaker and in some cases, disappeared entirely.  You have inputs coming at you all the time, why do you remember one thing and not the other? We think that somatostatin neurons may be gating whether synapses are used, and whether they can be changed during some important event, to enable learning,  said Barth, who is also a member of the joint CMU/University of Pittsburgh Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC). The researchers found that when the somatostatin neurons were turned on, this triggered the cloaking device. The neuron activated the GABAb receptors on hundreds of excitatory neurons in the immediate area. Activating this receptor suppressed the excitatory neurons, which prevented them from creating and strengthening synapses   and made them invisible to researchers. The researchers next plan to see if the somatostatin cells behave similarly in other areas of the brain. If they do, it could represent a novel target for studying and improving learning and memory.

People can be forgetful, and they can sometimes also ""remember"" things incorrectly, with devastating consequences in the classroom, courtroom, and other areas of life. Now, researchers show for the first time in the journal Current Biology that bumblebees can be unreliable witnesses too. The new study is the first to explore false memories in any non-human animals, the researchers say. They now suspect that the phenomenon may be widespread in the animal kingdom. ""We discovered that the memory traces for two stimuli can merge, such that features acquired in distinct bouts of training are combined in the animal's mind,"" says Lars Chittka of Queen Mary University of London. As a result, ""stimuli that have actually never been viewed before, but are a combination of the features presented in training, are chosen during memory recall."" Bumblebees are rather clever animals, which explains why Chittka has been studying learning and memory in the insects for the last 20 years. The bees can remember the patterns, colors, and scents of various kinds of flowers. They can also navigate to those flowers and back home again over long distances. Most times when people have studied memory in animals, errors in performance have been taken to mean that the animals failed to learn the task or perhaps learned it and then forgot. But Chittka and his colleague Kathryn Hunt wondered: What if animals can experience a more interesting type of memory failure? To find out, Chittka and Hunt first trained bumblebees to expect a reward when visiting a solid yellow artificial flower followed by one with black-and-white rings or vice versa. During subsequent tests, bees were given a choice between three types of flowers. Two were the yellow and the black-and-white types they'd seen before. The third type of flower had yellow-and-white rings, representing a mixed-up version of the other two. Minutes after the training, the bees showed a clear preference for the flower that most recently rewarded them. Their short-term memory for the flowers was good. One or three days later, however, something very different happened when the bumblebees' memory was put to the test. At first, the bees showed the same preference displayed in the earlier tests, but as the day wore on, they appeared to grow confused. Half of the time, they began selecting the flower with yellow rings, even though they'd never actually seen that one in training before. Chittka and Hunt say that the insects' observed merging of long-term memories is similar to the memory conjunction errors humans sometimes make. They don't think those false memories in either bumblebees or humans are simply ""bugs in the system,"" but rather are side effects of an adaptive memory system that is working rather well. In fact, Chittka's team recently found that people who are particularly good at learning rules to classify objects are also especially prone to these false memory illusions. ""There is no question that the ability to extract patterns and commonalities between different events in our environment [is] adaptive,"" Chittka says. ""Indeed, the ability to memorize the overarching principles of a number of different events might help us respond in new situations. But these abilities might come at the expense of remembering every detail correctly."" In bees, with their limited brain capacity, the pressure to ""economize"" by storing overarching features of a class of objects rather than each individual object might be even more intense. Chittka's lab is now using radar tracking to follow bees and their choices of flowers over a lifetime. ""We are fascinated to learn how lifetime experiences accumulate and are integrated in making day-to-day foraging decisions,"" he says. Cell Press Kathryn L. Hunt, Lars Chittka.

Despite modern agricultural practices, diseases of the major food crops cause up to 15% pre-harvest yield loss worldwide. Among these crops, wheat is a critical staple providing 20% of the calories and over 25% of the protein consumed by humans. One of the major fungal diseases of wheat that has re-emerged globally in recent years is yellow (stripe) rust caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis Westend f. sp. tritici Eriks. (PST).  This disease is widespread across the major wheat-producing areas of the world and can cause significant reductions in both grain quality and yield in susceptible cultivars. In the last decade, new PST variants have emerged that are adapted to warmer temperatures, have expanded their ability to infect different wheat varieties and are more aggressive than those previously characterised causing a serious threat to UK and global wheat production. Improved surveillance and diagnostic systems are essential in responding to the threat of such crop diseases. A team of scientists at TGAC, JIC, TSL and NIAB with funding from BBSRC have joined forces to develop a new pathogen surveillance technique called  field pathogenomics  that can be readily applied to these difficult pathogens. Based on new gene sequencing technologies this method enables scientists to assess the population structure of these pathogens directly from infected field samples, accelerating the response time of scientists and farmers to this disease. Working closely with the UK Cereal Pathogen Virulence Survey (UKCPVS), funded by the Home Grown Cereals Authority (HGCA) and The Food and Environment Research Agency (fera), the team used this strategy to sequence PST-infected wheat leaves from 17 different counties across the UK in 2013. Their analysis uncovered a marked increase in the diversity of PST and a complete change in the population composition when compared to older archived UK samples collected prior to 2011.  The authors conclude that this is likely due to a recent introduction of a disparate set of exotic PST variants that displaced the previous PST populations. This detailed knowledge directly influences the management of the disease and is helping breeders develop more resistant varieties to these new PST variants. This new methodology can be used to accelerate the genetic analysis of such plant pathogen populations and could potentially be widely applied to a variety of emerging plant and animal diseases.  Our new field pathogenomics method uses the latest sequencing technologies to rapidly generate high resolution data for describing the diversity in a pathogen population directly from infected field samples. This has been vital for characterising the recent dramatic changes in the wheat yellow rust populations in the UK, ensuring breeders, farmers and agronomists have access to the best possible information about the pathogen population to help them effectively manage disease and in breeding for enhanced resistance,  said Diane Saunders, lead author of the study and Computational Biology Fellow at TGAC and JIC. Rapid and systematic application of  field pathogenomics  has the potential to transform current disease surveillance systems by generating high-resolution genotypic information that can inform disease incidence models and agronomic practices. The next big challenge is to develop this new method further to reduce its cost so it can be routinely integrated into national surveillance programmes such as the UKCPVS. In the long-term, this will provide earlier indications of new pathogen variants and help deploy new wheat varieties with enhanced resistance. Dr Chris Burt, a cereal molecular geneticist at RAGT Seeds said:  There has been an explosion in the genetic diversity of yellow rust in the UK. This research provides us with a vastly improved understanding of this diversity, and a new method to monitor any future changes that occur. This is essential information to help us to develop varieties that are resistant to the wider range of yellow rust isolates that we now find in the field. ","Published: February 26, 2015"

The study points researchers toward safer and more robust methods of growing stem cells to treat disease and injury.  This is about quality control; we re making sure these cells are safe and effective,  said Jeanne Loring, a professor of developmental neurobiology at TSRI and senior author of the study with Louise Laurent, assistant professor at UC San Diego.  Laurent added,  The processes used to maintain and expand stem cell cultures for cell replacement therapies needs to be improved, and the resulting cells carefully tested before use.  The findings were published February 25 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE.  Growing Stem Cells Because these human stem cells, called ""pluripotent stem cells,"" can differentiate into many types of cells, they could be key to reversing degenerative diseases, such as Parkinson s disease, or repairing injured tissue, such as cardiac muscle after a heart attack. Stem cells are relatively rare in the body, however, so researchers must culture them in dishes. While all cells run the risk of mutating when they divide, previous research from Loring and her colleagues suggested that stem cell culturing may select for mutations that favor faster cell growth and are sometimes associated with tumors.   Most changes will not compromise the safety of the cells for therapy, but we need to monitor the cultures so that we know what sorts of changes take place,  said co-first author Ibon Garitaonandia, a postdoctoral researcher working in Loring s lab at the time of the study. The other co-first authors of the study were Hadar Amir of UC San Diego and Francesca Sesillo Boscolo of UC San Diego and TSRI. How to Reduce Mutations  The new research shows how certain culture conditions can reduce mutations.  Loring and her colleagues tested different combinations of substrate (the layer that the stem cells grow on) and  passaging  methods, in which researchers divide up colonies of stem cells and transfer them to new culture dishes. Some substrates included  feeder  cells that provide growth factors, while others did not. Passaging was performed manually or with special enzymes.  The team cultured stem cells continuously for over almost three years and passaged them over 100 times. Over the course of the experiment, the cells were analyzed for mutations using a method to identify changes in the genome.  In the end, the researchers found the fewest mutations in stem cells grown on a feeder layer substrate with the manual passaging method. The study also shows the importance of monitoring cell lines over time. For example, one mutation that appeared was the deletion of TP53, a tumor suppressor gene whose absence is associated with cancer.  The take-home messages for scientists:  If you want to preserve the integrity of the genome, then grow your cells under those conditions with feeder cells and manual passaging,  said Loring.  Also, analyze your cells it s really easy. ","Published: February 26, 2015"

With the acquisition, Shire has acquired the global rights to-and undertaken the further development of-Meritage s Phase 3-ready compound, Oral Budesonide Suspension (OBS), for the treatment of adolescents and adults with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a rare, chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal (GI) disease. This acquisition further enhances Shire s late-stage pipeline and builds upon the Company s rare disease and GI commercial infrastructure and expertise. Shire does not expect this acquisition to result in a change to its previously published earnings guidance for 2015. Shire obtained the rights to acquire Meritage in connection with its acquisition of ViroPharma in 2014. Shire s Head of Research and Development, Philip J. Vickers, Ph.D., commented:  Shire s pipeline and strategic focus on rare diseases is further strengthened with the acquisition of Meritage, which also complements our strong GI capabilities. Adding this Phase 3-ready compound to our late-stage portfolio will allow us to leverage our expertise to further develop this important therapy that, if approved, will give hope to patients living with eosinophilic esophagitis.  Meritage s President and Chief Executive Officer, Elaine Phillips, Ph.D., commented:  Meritage has worked closely with gastroenterologists, patients and their caregivers to develop Oral Budesonide Suspension, which was the first medication to significantly reduce eosinophilic inflammation and related symptom endpoints in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis in a Phase 2 clinical trial. The acquisition of Meritage by Shire, a global biotechnology company with GI and rare disease expertise, may benefit physicians and patients by helping develop OBS to potentially become the first approved treatment in the U.S. indicated for this often disabling disease.  EoE is a chronic disease that is increasingly being diagnosed in children and adults, with an estimated prevalence in the U.S. of ~181,000. It is characterized by inflammation and accumulation of a specific type of immune cell, called an eosinophil, in the esophagus. EoE patients may have persistent or relapsing symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction, which include dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and food impaction. OBS is a proprietary viscous oral formulation of budesonide that is designed to coat the esophagus where the drug can act locally. Budesonide is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in several products approved by the FDA, including products for the treatment of asthma, allergic rhinitis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease. Budesonide is a corticosteroid and has an established safety profile in those diseases. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug Status designation to OBS for the treatment of patients with EoE.","Published: February 26, 2015"

Timothy W. Bredy, assistant professor of neurobiology & behavior at University of California, Irvine (UCI), and colleagues at the University of Queensland (UQ) and the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sydney discovered that a gene called Gomafu might be key to understanding how our brain rapidly responds to stressful experiences. By looking across the entire genome for genes that are responsive to experience, they found Gomafu -- which has recently been associated with schizophrenia -- to be dynamically regulated in the adult brain. ""When Gomafu is turned off, this results in the kind of behavioural changes that are seen in anxiety and schizophrenia,"" said Bredy, who is also affiliated with UCI's Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory and UQ's Queensland Brain Institute. The gene is a long, noncoding RNA and was found within a section of the genome most commonly associated with ""junk"" DNA -- the 98 per cent of the human genome that, until recently, was thought to have no function. This is the first time long, noncoding RNA activity has been detected in the brain in response to experience ""Early biologists thought that DNA sequences that do not make protein were remnants of our evolutionary history, but the fact is these sequences are actually highly dynamic and exert a profound influence on us,"" Bredy said. Bredy and colleagues also found that noncoding genes such as Gomafu might represent a potent surveillance system that has evolved so that the brain can rapidly respond to changes in the environment. He added that a disruption of this network in the brain might contribute to the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. These findings also will help to resolve the current controversy surrounding genome-wide association studies, where the majority of gene mutations that correlate with specific neuropsychiatric disorders are found within vast stretches of noncoding DNA sequences. The scientists hope this finding will enable better prediction of vulnerability and resilience to developing a neuropsychiatric disease, with the primary goal to garner better treatment approaches across the lifespan.

Everyday experience and psychological studies alike tell us that there are two different types of extroverts: The gregarious ""people-persons"" who find reward in sharing affection and affiliation with others, and the ambitious ""go-getters"" who flash those bright-white smiles in their pursuit of achievement and leadership agendas. A new study shows that these overlapping yet distinct personalities have commensurately overlapping yet distinct signatures in the anatomy of the brain. ""These are people just sharing with you how they tend to experience the world and what's important to them,"" said Tara White, assistant professor (research) of behavioral and social sciences in the Brown University School of Public Health and corresponding author of the new study. ""The fact that that's validated in the brain is really exciting. There's a deep reality there."" The report, published in Cognitive, Affective, and Behavioral Neuroscience, is based on structural MRI scans of 83 men and women ranging in age from 18 to 54. That makes it the first study to produce evidence of the physical similarities and differences between extrovert types in the brain across adulthood. One other study had made such observations only in seniors. ""This is the first glimpse of a benchmark of what the healthy adult brain looks like with these traits,"" said White, who is based at Brown's Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies. She studies the neural basis of personality and how such personality differences change the way people respond to drugs and alcohol. In this study, subjects were first screened for mental and physical health and then were given standard personality tests that measured scores of both kinds of extroversion (psychologists call the people persons ""affiliative"" and the go-getters ""agentic"" (a-JEN-tick). The subjects then underwent MRI scans designed to detect the volume of gray matter in different regions of their brain. From the psychological literature on extroversion, White and lead author Erica Grodin, a graduate student, knew they wanted to look in regions of interest such as the medial orbitofrontal cortex, which is involved in making choices based on reward, but they also cast a broader net of analysis across the whole brain using a technique called voxel-based morphometry. As expected, they found that higher degrees of either kind of extroversion significantly correlated with higher gray matter volumes in the right and left medial orbitofrontal cortex, even after controlling for possible confounding factors such as age. But among the people with higher agentic extroversion scores, they also found several other regions that had significantly larger gray matter volumes: the parahippocampal gyrus (involved in learning and memory for reward); the precentral gyrus, cingulate gyrus, and caudate (involved in the cognitive control of behavior and the initiation, planning, and execution of voluntary movement toward goals); and, among the men in the study, the nucleus accumbens (involved in incentive reward). So while both kinds of extroverts had higher volumes in one key brain region, agentic extroverts also had higher volumes in several other areas. White and Grodin found many of those other areas through the VBM analysis of the whole brain. The authors caution that the study shows only an association, not whether or how larger volumes result in the personality traits. It also does not explain when larger volumes develop -- for example, whether people are born with or acquire the larger volumes associated with either extroversion tendency. But with further research, the new data could help scientists to better understand changes in emotionality over time. ""[The] findings provide a developmental benchmark from which to better understand the etiology of problems in agentic extroversion and affiliative extroversion, such as can occur in normal aging and neurodegenerative disease,"" Grodin and White wrote.

Children in the treatment group demonstrated significantly improved emotion-recognition skills and were rated as significantly better at facial-emotion recognition and expression. The children also had significantly lower parent ratings of autism symptoms, including social impairments following treatment. Impairment in social-communicative functioning is a defining feature of HFASD and it is exacerbated by significant problems in reading emotions in the facial and vocal expressions of others. To date, attempts to improve the emotion recognition skills of children with HFASD and thus their social functioning and symptoms have been largely unsuccessful. This has led some researchers to use computer-based treatment as a way to increase the emotion recognition skills of these children. These efforts however have resulted in narrow and limited gains that have not translated to more significant improvements in skills and symptoms. Given the narrow and limited gains reported by many investigators, researchers at the Institute for Autism Research set out to enhance a commonly used emotion-recognition software, Mind Reading (Jessica Kingsley Publishing, Inc.) for children with HFASD. According to Marcus L. Thomeer, PhD, co-director of the Institute for Autism Research and the study's lead author, ""the Mind Reading software has produced some promising findings however the gains were not leading to broader improvements for children with HFASD. We developed and tested a treatment that included additional elements we thought would greatly improve the effectiveness of the Mind Reading software."" Findings from the clinical trial, published this month in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, provide strong support for the effectiveness of the enhanced treatment. Christopher Lopata, PsyD, co-director of the Institute for Autism Research and one of the study's lead authors, noted that prior studies of the Mind Reading software for children with HFASD have relied almost exclusively on having the children learn and practice emotion recognition using the computer program alone. ""This approach left out an important element, the opportunity for the children to practice emotion recognition and expression skills with another person and receive feedback on the accuracy of their skills."" The research team developed a treatment that included Mind Reading computer instruction, repeated practice opportunities for emotion recognition and expression between the children and clinical staff, and reinforcement for accurately recognizing and expressing emotions in facial expressions. The unique treatment was administered during 24 sessions (two 90-minute sessions per week) over 12 weeks. A total of 43 children, ages 7-12 years with HFASD participated in the clinical trial, with 22 randomly assigned to receive the treatment and 21 to a wait-list control condition. Following the 12 week treatment, children in the treatment group demonstrated significantly better emotion-recognition skills and were rated as significantly better at facial-emotion recognition and expression by their parents compared to children in the control group. Children in the treatment group also had significantly lower parent ratings of autism symptoms, including social impairments following treatment compared to the control children. This suggested that the treatment had an effect on broader symptoms and impairments that were not directly targeted by the treatment. Follow-up ratings collected 2-3 months following the treatment indicated that the significant gains in emotion recognition and expression and the reduction in autism symptoms were maintained. ""These findings represent an important step as they suggest that emotion recognition and expression skills of children with HFASD can be significantly improved and autism symptoms and impairments reduced by providing direct instruction, real-life practice opportunities, and reinforcement for accuracy,"" said Thomeer. ""But more importantly the improvements were maintained after the treatment ended; this is promising as children with HFASD often have difficulty maintaining skills after treatment ends."" This is the first randomized trial of the Mind Reading computer program for children with HFASD and results suggest that the software can be especially effective when additional treatment elements including repeated real-life practice opportunities and reinforcement are included. Computer-based treatments such as Mind Reading have been identified as particularly appealing for this population as children with HFASD reportedly have an affinity toward working on computers.

Professor Masaharu Seno, head of the Lab of Nano-Biotechnology at the Department of Biotechnology, Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, is focused on finding new methods to treat the disease.  My research is focused on the development of innovative methods for cancer treatment,  says Seno.  Specifically, my group is using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to develop cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recently, we reported that cancer stem cells produced from mouse iPS cells, that then differentiate, are actually necessary for the maintenance of the cancer cells themselves. Understanding the mechanism governing the development of cancer is a major advance for the treatment of cancer.   Professor Seno points out that his group s success lies in producing cancer stem cells from iPS cells, which when transplanted into nude mouse, retains the stem cell like properties overcoming the ethical issues. CSCs from iPSCs and from mice also provides an abundant supply of many different kinds of cancer cells for experiments,  adds Professor Seno.  We are planning to produce a library of CSCs for customized cancer treatment.  In the future Professor Seno is planning to collaborate with industrial partners to develop CSC libraries in the form of a consortium to manage cell libraries. The ready availability of CSCs would enable the establishment of novel systems to evaluate agents for cancer therapy  including those which were previously dropped by pharmaceutical companies .  The research on cancer is an extension of Professor Seno s expertise in the design of  functional physiologically and biologically active molecules for medicine and public health . Other projects include the development of highly efficient, in vivo drug delivery systems (DDS) using nano-capsules of proteins or lipids to reduce side effects associated with conventional approaches; novel procedure for profiling tissues and cells for DDS; and design of novel mutant proteins of betacellulin (BTC) for the tissue regeneration therapy of pancreatic islets in diabetes therapy.","Published: February 25, 2015"

The announcement coincides with the start of the 16th annual Advances in Genome Biology and Technology (AGBT) scientific meeting in Marco Island, Florida. The Allele Frequency Community (www.allelefrequencycommunity.org) was recently formed after the 13 organizations agreed to pool their extensive human exome- and genome-wide variant call datasets in a secure, anonymized, pooled fashion to create the most ethnically diverse, freely-accessible, hosted community database of allele frequencies available. Until now, labs often collected their own, private allele frequency libraries, but did not have the infrastructure and incentives to integrate their resources into a freely-available community asset. Increasing participation in this community-based resource is expected to create greater value over time. In particular, the Allele Frequency Community has the potential to create increasing value for life sciences and clinical research since information on observed allele frequencies can create important benchmarks that significantly increase the accuracy of findings from data generated by molecular analyses, such as Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS).  To enable this resource to grow, users have the opportunity to opt-in to join the Allele Frequency Community and benefit from the extensive database, agreeing in return to contribute statistics from their sequences to the database. Only anonymous, pooled allele frequencies are provided, protecting patient privacy. The Allele Frequency Community database already holds more than 70,000 variant call datasets including 8,000 whole genomes and has been shown in internal benchmarking studies to generate a 43% average reduction in false positive rates in causal variant identification.  The founding collaborators of the Allele Frequency Community are:   David Goldstein, Columbia University Institute for Genomic Medicine  Madhuri Hegde, Emory Genetics Laboratory  Peter van der Spek, Erasmus University Medical Center  Eric Schadt, Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology at Mount Sinai  Gustavo Glusman, The Institute for Systems Biology  Greg Eley & Joe Volckley,Inova Translational Medicine Institute  Tom Kaminski &Stan LetovsEnlighten Health Genomics, a business of Laboratory Corporation of America  Holdings (LabCorp )  Nathan Pearson, New York Genome Center  Heidi Rehm, Partners Healthcare Personalized Medicine  Doug Bassett, QIAGEN Bioinformatics   Phil Hieter, University of British Columbia  Jay Shendure, University of Washington  Chris Mason, Weill Cornell Medical College QIAGEN N.V. is one of the founding collaborators of the Allele Frequency Community, and is providing bioinformatics infrastructure and software for the development of this community-based resource.   Over the last few years, access to allele frequency data from large populations has been the most useful resource for the interpretation of human variation,  said Dr. Heidi Rehm, Ph.D., Director of the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at Partners Healthcare Personalized Medicine.  The Allele Frequency Community is a really valuable project. I am happy to share data through this new resource and excited that many other people have agreed to do so as well.  An allele is an alternative form of a gene found in a person s DNA. Scientists need diverse, large-scale data on allele frequencies to accurately identify potential disease-causing DNA changes in a population. Information on allele frequency also tells clinicians how common certain changes are within the population, helping to distinguish rare, disease-causing DNA changes from more common variations. A key challenge has been the lack of extensive collections of human genomes as a reference set. A prospective disease-causing variant that appears to be  rare  based on publicly available data may in fact be more prevalent in an ethnic population under-represented in public databases.  The Allele Frequency Community database is more than just a simple repository; it is a dynamic resource that has been designed to grow and become more informative through more use by members of the community,  said Dr. John Niederhuber, M.D., Chief Executive Officer at Inova Translational Medicine Institute.  Large-scale datasets of diverse allele frequency data are critical to advancing personalized medicine, and Inova is pleased to support this important global collaboration. By taking advantage of anonymized pooled data, this project will support patients and clinicians who have struggled to identify the elusive genetic changes that are necessary to diagnose and treat complex diseases.  The data of the Allele Frequency Community is stored on QIAGEN s secure, HIPAA and Safe Harbor compliant IT infrastructure and made available for free to registered community members. Researchers can initially explore the data using QIAGEN s Ingenuity  Variant Analysis . The data is planned to be accessible via other analysis and data interpretation tools in the future, including QIAGEN s Ingenuity Clinical decision-support solution currently in development as well as CLC Cancer Research Workbench, CLC Genomics Workbench and other bioinformatics solutions.  The currently available public allele frequency data does not have the diverse coverage needed for disease research and clinical interpretation. The Allele Frequency Community aims to address this important challenge by encouraging the broad sharing and utility of this information in a privacy-protected way for the benefit of patients,  said Dr. Doug Bassett, Vice President Translational Research & Chief Scientific Officer at QIAGEN Bioinformatics.  QIAGEN is pleased to sponsor this important project, and we look forward to working closely with the Allele Frequency Community to address the pressing need for high-quality, diverse allele frequency information, which is vital to realizing the full potential of personalized healthcare.  Dr. Bassett will present details on the participation of QIAGEN in the Allele Frequency Community in a seminar at the Advances in Genome Biology and Technology (AGBT) meeting in Marco Island, Florida.

The discovery, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, details how Rasa3 is part of a cellular pathway crucial for platelet activity during clot formation. Understanding the protein s role could also prove vital in the development of new compounds aimed at altering platelet function.  We believe these findings could lead to improved strategies for treatment following a heart attack and a better understanding of why people respond differently to anti-platelet drugs, such as aspirin and Plavix,  said Wolfgang Bergmeier, PhD, professor of biochemistry and biophysics, member of the McAllister Heart Institute at UNC, and senior author of the paper. The research, which was conducted in mice, may also open the door to developing antidotes to Plavix, which was the second-best selling drug in the world prior to its patent expiring in 2012. It is still prescribed under its generic name clopidogrel to millions of people with heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. However, the drug s anti-platelet effect increases the risk of bleeding in patients and makes emergency surgery too risky because Plavix affects the ability of platelets to prevent blood loss after vascular injury. An antidote would bypass the need to wait until the kidneys eliminate the drug from circulation.  Since the 1970s, scientists knew that clopidogrel had an anti-clotting effect on platelets. In 2001, they found the compound s target   a cell receptor called P2Y12. As Plavix was developed into a multi-billion-dollar drug, scientists still didn t know how this receptor communicated with other proteins in the cell pathways important for platelet activation. This also meant they didn t know why people responded differently to the drug. Researchers have since learned that the receptor P2Y12 communicates with a small protein called Rap1, which is like a cellular switch. In platelets, this switch is typically off, which keeps platelets in a non-sticky state. In this quiet state, the 2.5 trillion platelets can patrol blood vessels and arteries without sticking to the endothelium   or inside wall   of, say, a coronary artery. If there s a problem in the endothelium, the Rap1 switch is flipped and platelets morph into super sticky cells that clot fast to keep blood from gushing into tissue. This is crucial when we have a severe injury or even a cut. But this clotting also happens during a heart attack, when a massive clot is the last thing a person with heart disease needs. In the arteries that feed blood to the heart, plaque builds over time. But this buildup isn t typically the cause of heart attacks; they occur when the plaque ruptures and platelets rush in to plug the rupture. This clotting blocks the artery, which blocks oxygen from entering the heart. And that causes the heart attack. To counteract the effects of the clot, Plavix hits its P2Y12 target to flip the Rap1 switch back to the off position so the platelets return to their quiet, non-sticky state. Aspirin also helps keep platelets from sticking. Until now, no one knew how hitting the P2Y12 receptor triggered the Rap1 protein to switch off. The experiments conducted by the Bergmeier lab show that the Rasa3 protein is a crucial player in this process.  Platelets live in unique environment and they need to be very sensitive to changes in that environment,  Bergmeier said.  They are ready to jump into action almost without anything happening. You could say they re in a preloaded state. But for that to be possible, they need a breaking system that keeps the platelets in the off state so that they don t do anything until they absolutely have to.  Rasa3 is a key part of that breaking system, and Plavix makes sure that the break stays on. Think of a platelet like a circuit with Rap1-GDP representing the off state and Rap1-GTP representing the on state. In between, there are proteins called exchange factors (GEFs), which flip on the platelet s Rap1 machinery. The proteins needed to switch off Rap1 are called GAPs.  Using deep sequencing techniques, Bergmeier s team found that Rasa3 was the only highly expressed GAP gene for Rap1 in platelets. He thought that a malfunctioning Rasa3 protein would lead to platelet activation and clearance from circulation. His team knocked out Rasa3 in mice to show that the offspring had no platelets and could not survive. The researchers then used mice from The Jackson Laboratory to study platelets in mice with a Rasa3 mutation. These mice had 3 to 5 percent of the typical platelet count. Bergmeier s team found that the rest of the platelets were being activated and cleared from circulation. When the researchers disabled the major GEF proteins, the platelet counts rose to normal amounts in the mice. This showed that a tightly controlled balance between GEF and GAP proteins, especially Rasa3, is vital for platelet activity. At the sites of vascular injury there s a shift in this balance inside a platelet that makes the cells very sticky. Plavix ensures that Rasa3 cannot be turned off in platelets; the drug irreversibly limits the cell s ability to stick. It keeps the cell s breaking system perpetually on.  These experiments show that this Rap1 GEF-GAP pathway is crucial for platelets to jump into action to plug a hole in the endothelium,  Bergmeier said.  And now we know that Rasa3 is a critical negative regulator, a break, on the process.  Bergmeier added,  We have good reason to believe that the Rap1 switch, controlled by the same GEF and GAP proteins, also regulates the active state of human platelets. We expect this research will provide critical information for improving anti-platelet therapies, possibly including approaches that eliminate some of the patient-to-patient variability and the increased bleeding risk associated with current anti-platelet drugs.

The adaptive immune system is developed largely to combat secondary infections: having recognized an invading pathogen it will produce antibodies that can attack the infection. Other responses can also be triggered, such as mucus production to trap and expel pathogens. Researchers at Imperial College London have shown that one particular type of neurotransmitter, or signalling molecule, has an important role in our adaptive immune response as well as in the innate immune system. If this signalling molecule could be mimicked and incorporated into a drug formulation, it could potentially be used to boost people s immunity to infection. The neurotransmitter, called acetylcholine, has a number of complex roles within the body. It helps to carry messages around the body s nervous system to activate muscles, for example, while in the brain it is responsible for transmitting sensory information. Acetylcholine is already known to also play a role in regulating the body s innate immune response - for example, it can slow the inflammatory response to infection which, if unchecked, can lead to inflammatory diseases or organ damage. In a study published in the journal PLOS Pathogens, a team from Imperial College London and the University of Cape Town showed that acetylcholine was also important for the production of cytokines - proteins which stimulate the body s adaptive immune responses. ""We started to look at these neurotransmitters in relation to the adaptive immune response because of work that we had been doing on helminth parasites,  explained Professor Murray Selkirk, Head of the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial College London.  These parasitic worms have sophisticated ways of suppressing the immune system of their host. They release an enzyme that degrades acetylcholine. We suspected that this must be benefitting them in some way, suggesting that the neurotransmitter is doing something which is detrimental to the parasite."" In a collaboration with scientists at the University of Cape Town, the team studied a group of mice bred to be unresponsive to acetylcholine acting on a specific receptor. Some of the mice were infected with helminth parasites and some with salmonella bacteria, and their adaptive immune responses were measured. They discovered that the mice were less able to fight off either infection effectively, indicating that the neurotransmitter had a role to play in adaptive immunity.  We already knew that this neurotransmitter played an important role in the innate immune system, but what we have found in this study is that it also activates other responses that are important for adaptive immunity,  says Professor Selkirk.  We hope this finding could lead to new ways of boosting people s ability to fight off infection.  The results are also significant for the use of existing drugs such as Tiotropium, which is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and recently approved for treatment of asthma. These drugs work by inhibiting the neurotransmitter s signalling system to impede smooth muscle contraction and mucus production - both of which worsen the symptoms of these diseases. This study suggests that in suppressing these, there could also be an effect on other immune responses, which now need to be investigated.","Published: February 25, 2015"

Of course!  But daydreaming involves more than just beating back boredom. In fact, according to a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a wandering mind can impart a distinct cognitive advantage. Scientists at Bar-Ilan University are the first to demonstrate how an external stimulus of low-level electricity can literally change the way we think, producing a measurable up-tick in the rate at which daydreams   or spontaneous, self-directed thoughts and associations   occur. Along the way, they made another surprising discovery: that while daydreams offer a welcome  mental escape  from boring tasks, they also have a positive, simultaneous effect on task performance. The new study was carried out in Bar-Ilan's Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory supervised by Prof. Moshe Bar, part of the University s Gonda (Goldschmied) Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center which Prof. Bar also directs. While a far cry from the diabolical manipulation of dream content envisioned in  Inception    the science-fiction thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio   the Bar-Ilan University study is the first to prove that a generic external stimulus, unrelated to sensory perception, triggers a specific type of cognitive activity. In the experiment   designed and executed by Prof. Bar s post-doctoral researcher Dr. Vadim Axelrod   participants were treated with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive and painless procedure that uses low-level electricity to stimulate specific brain regions.  During treatment, the participants were asked to track and respond to numerals flashed on a computer screen.  They were also periodically asked to respond to an on-screen  thought probe  in which they reported   on a scale of one to four   the extent to which they were experiencing spontaneous thoughts unrelated to the numeric task they had been given. According to Prof. Bar   a long-time faculty member at Harvard Medical School who has authored several studies exploring the link between associative thinking, memory and predictive ability   the specific brain area targeted for stimulation in this study was anything but random.  We focused tDCS stimulation on the frontal lobes because this brain region has been previously implicated in mind wandering, and also because is a central locus of the executive control network that allows us to organize and plan for the future,  Bar explains, adding that he suspected that there might be a connection between the two.  As a point of comparison and in separate experiments, the researchers used tDCS to stimulate the occipital cortex   the visual processing center in the back of the brain.  They also conducted control studies where no tDCS was used. While the self-reported incidence of mind wandering was unchanged in the case of occipital and sham stimulation, it rose considerably when this stimulation was applied to the frontal lobes.  Our results go beyond what was achieved in earlier, fMRI-based studies,  Bar states.  They demonstrate that the frontal lobes play a causal role in the production of mind wandering behavior.  In an unanticipated finding, the present study demonstrated how the increased mind wandering behavior produced by external stimulation not only does not harm subjects  ability to succeed at an appointed task, it actually helps. Bar believes that this surprising result might stem from the convergence, within a single brain region, of both the  thought controlling  mechanisms of executive function and the  thought freeing  activity of spontaneous, self-directed daydreams.  Over the last 15 or 20 years, scientists have shown that   unlike the localized neural activity associated with specific tasks   mind wandering involves the activation of a gigantic default network involving many parts of the brain,  Bar says.   This cross-brain involvement may be involved in behavioral outcomes such as creativity and mood, and may also contribute to the ability to stay successfully on-task while the mind goes off on its merry mental way.  While it is commonly assumed that people have a finite cognitive capacity for paying attention, Bar says that the present study suggests that the truth may be more complicated.  Interestingly, while our study s external stimulation increased the incidence of mind wandering, rather than reducing the subjects  ability to complete the task, it caused task performance to become slightly improved. The external stimulation actually enhanced the subjects  cognitive capacity.  Bar says that, in the future, he would be interested in studying how external stimulation might affect other cognitive behaviors, such as the ability to focus or perform multiple tasks in parallel. And while any therapeutic application of this technique is speculative at best, he believes that it might someday help neuroscientists understand the behavior of people suffering from low or abnormal neural activity.  In the meantime, Bar s team at the BIU Lab for Cognitive Neuroscience is pleased to note that in their work on mind wandering   probably the most omnipresent internal cognitive function   they have made the human brain just a little less mysterious.

""We hypothesized that since skin has the same origin as brain tissue while in the embryo that they might also show the same abnormal proteins. This new test offers a potential biomarker that may allow doctors to identify and diagnose these diseases earlier on."" For the study, researchers took skin biopsies from 20 people with Alzheimer's disease, 16 with Parkinson's disease and 17 with dementia caused by other conditions and compared them to 12 healthy people in the same age group. They tested these skin samples to see if specific types of altered proteins were found -- ones that indicate a person has Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. As compared to healthy patients and ones with dementia caused by other conditions, those with both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's had seven times higher levels of the tau protein. People with Parkinson's also had an eight times higher level of alpha-synuclein protein than the healthy control group. Alzheimer's disease is ranked as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and 5.4 million Americans are currently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Parkinson's disease affects one million Americans, with at least 60,000 new cases reported annually each year.

It affects between 1-3% of children in Western Europe, the USA, and Australia and in recent years has become an important cause of food allergies in African and Asian countries. Peanut allergy develops early in life, is rarely out-grown and there is currently no cure. It imposes a considerable burden, impacting negatively on quality of life for patients and their families. The LEAP study, a randomized controlled trial, enrolled 640 children aged 4-11 months from Evelina London Children s Hospital, who were considered at high-risk of developing peanut allergy due to pre-existing severe eczema and/or egg allergy. To determine whether peanut consumption or avoidance is the most effective strategy to prevent peanut allergy, half of the children were asked to eat peanut-containing foods three or more times each week, and the other half to avoid eating peanut until 5 years of age. Adherence to peanut consumption or avoidance advice was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire at regular intervals during the study and by measuring peanut levels in the child s home environment. Remarkably, less than 1% of children who consumed peanut as per study protocol and completed the study developed peanut allergy by 5 years of age, while 17.3% in the avoidance group developed peanut allergy. Even when considering all children enrolled - including those participants who were unable to tolerate peanut consumption (13 of the 319 children who were randomised to peanut consumption had some allergic responses to peanut during the study) - a powerful protective effect against the development of peanut allergy remains: the overall prevalence of allergy in all children asked to consume peanut was 3.2% versus 17.2% in the avoidance group. This represents a greater than 80% reduction in the prevalence of peanut allergy. Nearly all participants enrolled on the LEAP study completed the final assessment at age 5 years (98%).  Importantly, the early introduction of peanut-containing foods was found to be safe and well tolerated; infants were not fed whole peanuts which carry a risk of choking in young children.  The study was therefore able to conclude that early, sustained consumption of peanut is safe and associated with a substantial and significant decrease in the development of peanut allergy in high-risk infants by the age of five.  Deliberate avoidance of peanut in the first year of life is consequently brought into question as a strategy to prevent allergy. Professor Gideon Lack, Head of Department of Paediatric Allergy, King s College London and Head of the Children s Allergy Service at Guy s and St Thomas  NHS Foundation Trust, who led the study, presented the findings at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology meeting (AAAAI):  This is an important clinical development and contravenes previous guidelines. Whilst these were withdrawn in 2008 in the UK and US, our study suggests that new guidelines may be needed to reduce the rate of peanut allergy in our children.  Professor Lack further noted that:  The study also excluded infants showing early strong signs of having already developed peanut allergy; the safety and effectiveness of early peanut consumption in this group remains unknown and requires further study. Parents of infants and young children with eczema and/or egg allergy should consult with an Allergist, Paediatrician, or their General Practitioner prior to feeding them peanut products.    Dr George Du Toit, consultant in Paediatric Allergy at Guy s and St Thomas  NHS Foundation Trust and honorary senior lecturer, King s College London, co-investigator of the study, said:  The next stage of our work, the LEAP-On study, will continue to monitor those children who consumed peanut to see if they remain protected against allergy even if they stop consuming peanut for 12 months. The LEAP-On study will help establish if the protection provided against the development of peanut allergy is sustained and not dependent on ongoing peanut ingestion.

Our findings open a new window into the normal and diseased brain by providing the first evidence that DNA variation in individual neurons could be related to brain function and Alzheimer s disease,  said Jerold Chun, professor at TSRI and its Dorris Neuroscience Center and senior author of the new study.  A Devastating Disease of Unknown Cause Alzheimer s disease is an irreversible brain disease that tends to strike older people. It is progressive impairing memory, destroying motor skills and eventually causing death. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 5.3 million Americans currently have Alzheimer s disease, and that number is expected to double by 2050 as the population ages.  Scientists still do not know what triggers the majority of Alzheimer s cases, making it difficult to develop a treatment. Some genes have been identified in families, however 95 percent of cases are  sporadic,  with no link to a gene or family history of Alzheimer s.  Researchers have long known about disease-related protein accumulations (called amyloid plaques) in the brains of Alzheimer s patients. They ve also known that chromosome 21 plays a role in the disease, due to Alzheimer s-like symptoms in people with Down syndrome (with three copies of chromosome 21). This chromosome contains the APP gene, which can lead to production of the primary component of the damaging amyloid plaques.  Chun and his laboratory group have had a longstanding interest in genomic variation among brain cells, which produces  genomic mosaicism.  In 2001, Chun was the first to report that the brain contains many distinct genomes within its cells much like the colorful tiles in an artist s mosaic.  When we started, genomic mosaicism in the brain was not recognized,  said Chun.  But it turns out there is a remarkable range of genomic changes encompassed by DNA content variation in single brain cells.  The Alzheimer s Brain as a Mosaic  In the new study, Chun and his colleagues first set out to analyze the overall DNA content in cells, comparing 32 post-mortem Alzheimer s brains and 21 post-mortem non-diseased brains.  Remarkably, the researchers found that more than 90 percent of sporadic Alzheimer s disease brains displayed highly significant DNA increases of hundreds of millions more DNA base-pairs, compared with control samples, showing that genomic mosaicism was altered in the Alzheimer s brain. Interestingly, these changes were not found everywhere, but were greatest in a part of the brain involved with complex thought.  Next, the researchers used a technique called single-cell qPCR to determine the numbers of APP copies in 154 individual neurons from Alzheimer s and normal brains. They also tested the neurons using a technique called FISH as an independent method to assess APP copies using fluorescent probes. The researchers then quantified the copies of APP using both techniques.  The tests showed that neurons from patients with sporadic Alzheimer s disease were four times as likely to contain more than the normal two copies of APP, with some Alzheimer s neurons containing up to 12 copies of APP, a phenomenon never seen in the controls.   A lot of people are still not aware of genomic mosaicism in the brain, so to be able to connect it with a disease is really interesting,  said Gwen Kaeser, a graduate student studying in Chun s lab and co-first author of the study with former graduate student Diane Bushman. A Clue to Other Brain Diseases  While genetic tests on blood samples can reveal if a person is prone to developing an inherited, familial form of Alzheimer s, most people who develop Alzheimer s do not test positive. The new study suggests that such genetic signatures might be lacking in the blood of the majority of patients because the genomic signatures of sporadic Alzheimer s disease occur within individual brain cells.  Indeed, a majority of major brain diseases are also sporadic. For example, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can be linked to a gene in one to two percent of cases, but the rest are sporadic, having no known cause. Chun believes genomic mosaicism could possibly have a role in other brain diseases.  Future studies in the Chun lab will investigate the relationship between mosaicism and disease, the causes of mosaicism and potential new disease drug targets present in the millions of extra base-pairs found in single, Alzheimer s disease neurons.

One of them has been identified as FA1 synthesized by the acetylation of fumonisin B1 (FB1), and established a method for its quantification. Herein, we identified the two remaining compounds as FA2 and FA3, which were acetylated fumonisin B2 (FB2) and fumonisin B3 (FB3), respectively. Moreover, we examined a method for the simultaneous analysis of FA1, FA2, FA3, FB1, FB2, and FB3. The corn samples were prepared by extraction using a QuEChERS kit and purification using a multifunctional cartridge. The linearity, recovery, repeatability, limit of detection, and limit of quantification of the method were >0.99, 82.9%-104.6%, 3.7%-9.5%, 0.02-0.60  g/kg, and 0.05-1.98  g/kg, respectively. The simultaneous analysis of the six fumonisins revealed that FA1, FA2, and FA3 were present in all corn samples contaminated with FB1, FB2, and FB3. The results suggested that corn marketed for consumption can be considered as being contaminated with both the fumonisin B-series and with fumonisin A-series. This report presents the first identification and quantification of FA1, FA2, and FA3 in corn samples.

The findings, published online in STEM CELLS Translational Medicine, indicate they also could become a new source of corneal transplant tissue made from the patient s own cells. Corneal blindness, which affects millions of people worldwide, is typically treated with transplants of donor corneas, said senior investigator James Funderburgh, Ph.D., professor of ophthalmology at Pitt and associate director of the Louis J. Fox Center for Vision Restoration of UPMC and the University of Pittsburgh, a joint program of UPMC Eye Center and the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine.  Shortages of donor corneas and rejection of donor tissue do occur, which can result in permanent vision loss,  Dr. Funderburgh said.  Our work is promising because using the patient s own cells for treatment could help us avoid these problems.  Experiments conducted by lead author Fatima Syed-Picard, Ph.D., also of Pitt s Department of Ophthalmology, and the team showed that stem cells of the dental pulp, obtained from routine human third molar, or wisdom tooth, extractions performed at Pitt s School of Dental Medicine, could be turned into corneal stromal cells called keratocytes, which have the same embryonic origin. The team injected the engineered keratocytes into the corneas of healthy mice, where they integrated without signs of rejection. They also used the cells to develop constructs of corneal stroma akin to natural tissue.  Other research has shown that dental pulp stem cells can be used to make neural, bone and other cells,  Dr. Syed-Picard noted.  They have great potential for use in regenerative therapies.

The findings, now online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), might lead to new treatments to help people with impaired ability to metabolize acetaldehyde and other toxic substances. NIAAA is part of the National Institutes of Health. ""This intriguing finding could have important implications,"" said NIAAA Director George F. Koob, Ph.D. ""Developing pharmacologic agents that alter an enzyme s substrate specificity is a unique approach that may have wide clinical application in treating patients with impaired ability to detoxify toxic substances. We look forward to further research aimed at translating these laboratory discoveries into possible treatments for people."" After alcohol is consumed, it is first metabolized into acetaldehyde, a toxic chemical that can cause DNA damage and cancer.  In the liver, aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is the main enzyme responsible for breaking down acetaldehyde into acetate, a nontoxic metabolite. It also removes other toxic aldehydes that can accumulate in the body.  An estimated 560 million people in East Asia, and many people of East Asian descent, carry a genetic mutation that produces an inactive form of ALDH2. When individuals with the ALDH2 mutation drink alcohol, acetaldehyde accumulates in the body, resulting in facial flushing, nausea, and rapid heartbeat.  People with the ALDH2 mutation are also at increased risk for cancers of the mouth, esophagus, and other areas of the upper aerodigestive tract. Researchers led by Daria Mochly-Rosen, Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Chemical and Systems Biology at Stanford University, Stanford, California, have developed a number of small molecules called aldehyde dehydrogenase activators, or Aldas, that in previous studies have been found to increase the activity of the ALDH2 enzyme. In the current study, they tested a new compound, Alda-89, which they found could provide another aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme   ALDH3A1 -- with accelerated acetaldehyde-metabolizing powers that it ordinarily does not possess.  We targeted the ALDH3A1 enzyme because it metabolizes acetaldehyde poorly and is highly expressed in the upper airway, stomach and gut, all tissues that are prone to cancer development in people who drink alcohol in excess,  said Dr. Mochly-Rosen.  By recruiting ALDH3A1 to metabolize acetaldehyde we could perhaps accelerate the elimination of acetaldehyde from tissues that are more vulnerable to its carcinogenic effects.  Dr. Mochly-Rosen and her colleagues showed that Alda-89 increased acetaldehyde metabolism both in normal mice and in mice carrying the ALDH2 mutation found in the East Asian population.  The researchers also showed that, in test tube analyses, acetaldehyde removal was faster when they combined Alda-89 with Alda-1, a compound previously shown to activate ALDH2, compared with activating each ALDH alone.  They also showed in animal studies that mice treated with the combination of Alda-89 and Alda-1 exhibit accelerated recovery from alcohol intoxication.","Published: February 24, 2015"

The molecule foils a wider range of HIV strains in the laboratory than any known broadly neutralizing HIV antibody and is more powerful than some of the most potent of these antibodies. In addition, the molecule safely protected monkeys from infection with an HIV-like virus during a 40-week study period. Together, the data suggest that the molecule could, with further research, be used to subdue HIV in humans. The authors note that the molecule potentially could be used as both a preventative drug and as a treatment. The new findings appear in the February 18 issue of the journal Nature.  Our molecule appears to be the most potent and broadest inhibitor of HIV entry so far described in a preclinical study.   This innovative research holds promise for moving us toward two important goals: achieving long-term protection from HIV infection, and putting HIV into sustained remission in chronically infected people,  said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. The research was led by Michael Farzan, Ph.D., a professor in the department of infectious diseases at The Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Florida. The work was funded primarily by NIAID. The new molecule is called eCD4-Ig and works by tightly binding to two unchanging sites on the surface of HIV that the virus uses to attach to receptors on cells called CD4 and CCR5. Typically, when HIV attaches to these receptors, it unlocks a door to the cell and gets inside. However, when eCD4-Ig binds to HIV, it effectively takes away the virus s key, locking it out of the cell and preventing it from multiplying. To make eCD4-Ig, the scientists took an antibody-like molecule that latches onto the CD4 binding site but does not neutralize HIV on its own, and fused it with a short protein fragment that attaches tightly to the CCR5 binding site. Together, these two arms of the molecule are much more effective at stopping HIV than either one is alone. To test whether eCD4-Ig would protect monkeys from an HIV-like virus (simian immunodeficiency virus, or SIV), the scientists synthesized genetic instructions for making the molecule and placed them inside a harmless carrier virus called adeno-associated virus, or AAV. This gene-therapy tool was designed such that once the AAV-modified virus infected a cell, it would cause the cell to make eCD4-Ig indefinitely. The researchers injected the genetically modified AAV into four monkeys. Then they exposed both the treated monkeys and four untreated monkeys to SIV six times at increasingly higher doses over a 34-week period. None of the treated monkeys became infected with SIV, while all of the untreated monkeys did. The eCD4-Ig molecule made in the monkey s cells persisted in the animals  blood in a fully functional form and at protective concentrations for the entire 40-week study period. In addition, the scientists found that while monkeys  immune systems view both eCD4-Ig and broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV-like viruses as foreign molecules to some degree, the undesirable immune response generated by eCD4-Ig is milder than that generated by infusions of broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies. Scientists have been investigating these antibodies as another promising approach to long-acting treatment for HIV.  Our molecule appears to be the most potent and broadest inhibitor of HIV entry so far described in a preclinical study,  said Dr. Farzan.  If one could inject either eCD4-Ig or our gene therapy tool into people with HIV infection, it might control HIV for extended periods in the absence of antiretroviral drugs. Further research will help illuminate the promise of these approaches.  To build on their findings, the scientists are studying both the therapeutic potential of eCD4-Ig in monkeys infected with HIV-like viruses and the ability of eCD4-Ig to prevent infection against a wider range of HIV and HIV-like strains.","Published: February 24, 2015"

The finding, reported in Advanced Functional Materials (early online), is based on experiments in human blood and mouse clotting models. If the drug delivery system performs similarly well in planned human clinical trials, it could mean a major step forward in the prevention of strokes, heart attacks, pulmonary embolisms, and other dire circumstances where clots -- if not quickly busted -- can cause severe tissue damage and death. ""We have designed the nanoparticles so that they trap themselves at the site of the clot, which means they can quickly deliver a burst of the commonly used clot-busting drug tPA where it is most needed,"" said Paolo Decuzzi, Ph.D., the study's co-principal investigator. Decuzzi leads the Houston Methodist Research Institute Dept. of Translational Imaging. Decuzzi's group coated iron oxide nanoparticles in albumin, a protein found naturally in blood. The albumin provides a sort of camouflage, giving the loaded nanoparticles time to reach their blood clot target before the body's immune system recognizes the nanoparticles as invaders and attacks them. Iron oxide was chosen for the core because the researchers plan to use them for magnetic resonance imaging, remote guidance with external magnetic fields, and for further accelerating clot dissolution with localized magnetic heating. The clot-busting drug loaded into the nanoparticles is tPA, tissue plasminogen activator, an enzyme that is also found naturally in blood at low concentrations. Typically, a small volume of concentrated tPA is injected into a stroke patient s blood upstream of a confirmed or suspected clot. From there, some of the tPA reaches the clot, but much of it may cruise past or around the clot, potentially ending up anywhere in the circulatory system. tPA is typically used in emergency scenarios by health care staff, but it can be dangerous to patients who are prone to hemorrhage. ""Treating clots is a serious problem for all hospitals, and we take them very seriously as surgeons,"" said cardiovascular surgeon and coauthor Alan Lumsden, M.D. ""Although tPA and similar drugs can be very effective in rescuing our patients, the drug is broken down quickly in the blood, meaning we have to use more of it to achieve an effective clinical dose. Yet using more of the drug creates its own problems, increasing the risk of hemorrhage. If hemorrhage happens in the brain, it could be fatal."" Lumsden, who is medical director of the Houston Methodist DeBakey Heart & Vascular Center, said the nanoparticles being developed in Decuzzi's lab could solve both problems. ""The nanoparticle protects the drug from the body's defenses, giving the tPA time to work,"" he said. ""But it also allows us to use less tPA, which could make hemorrhage less likely. We are excited to see if the technique works as phenomenally well for our patients as what we saw in these experiments."" Decuzzi, Lumsden, and colleagues tested the effectiveness of tPA-loaded nanoparticles, using human tissue cultures to see where tPA landed and how long it took for the tPA to destroy fibrin-rich clots. In a series of in vivo experiments, the researchers introduced blood clots to a mouse model, injecting tPA-loaded nanoparticles into the bloodstream and using optical microscopy to follow the dissolution of the clots. In comparison to a control, the clots were destroyed about 100 times faster. Although free tPA is usually injected at room temperature, a number of studies suggest tPA is most effective at higher temperatures (40 C or about 104 F). The same seems to be true for tPA delivered via Decuzzi's iron oxide nanoparticles. By exposing the iron oxide nanoparticles to external, alternating magnetic fields, the researchers created friction and heat. Warmer tPA (42 C or about 108 F) was released faster and increased another 10 times (to 1,000) the rate of clot dissolution. ""We think it is possible to use a static magnetic field first to help guide the nanoparticles to the clot, then alternate the orientation of the field to increase the nanoparticles' efficiency in dissolving clots,"" Decuzzi said. Coauthor and Vascular Ultrasound Lab Medical Director Zsolt Garami, M.D., added, ""By heating the clot, tPA worked better."" Next steps in the research, Decuzzi said, will be testing the nanoparticles' safety and effectiveness in other animal models, with the ultimate goal of human clinical trials. Decuzzi said his group will continue to examine the feasibility of using magnetic fields to guide and heat the nanoparticles. ""We are optimistic because the FDA has already approved the use of iron oxide as a contrast agent in MRIs,"" Decuzzi said. ""And we do not anticipate needing to use as much of the iron oxide at concentrations higher than what's already been approved. The other chemical aspects of the nanoparticles are natural substances you already find in the bloodstream.""

Long thought to be merely a byproduct of neuron activity, recent studies suggest that these waves may play a critical role in communication between different parts of the brain. A new study from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) neuroscientists adds to that evidence. The researchers found that two brain regions that are key to learning -- the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex -- use two different brain-wave frequencies to communicate as the brain learns to associate unrelated objects. Whenever the brain correctly links the objects, the waves oscillate at a higher frequency, called ""beta,"" and when the guess is incorrect, the waves oscillate at a lower ""theta"" frequency. ""It's like you're playing a computer game and you get a ding when you get it right, and a buzz when you get it wrong. These two areas of the brain are playing two different 'notes' for correct guesses and wrong guesses,"" says Earl Miller, the Picower Professor of Neuroscience, a member of MIT's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, and senior author of a paper describing the findings currently published online in Nature Neuroscience. Furthermore, these oscillations may reinforce the correct guesses while repressing the incorrect guesses, helping the brain learn new information, the researchers say. Miller and lead author Scott Brincat, a research scientist at the Picower Institute, examined activity in the brain as it forms a type of memory called explicit memory -- memory for facts and events. This includes linkages between items such as names and faces, or between a location and an event that took place there. During the learning task, animals were shown pairs of images and gradually learned, through trial and error, which pairs went together. Each correct response was signaled with a reward. As the researchers recorded brain waves in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex during this task, they noticed that the waves occurred at different frequencies depending on whether the correct or incorrect response was given. When the guess was correct, the waves occurred in the beta frequency, about 9 to 16 hertz (cycles per second). When incorrect, the waves oscillated in the theta frequency, about 2 to 6 hertz. Previous studies by MIT's Mark Bear, also a member of the Picower Institute, have found that stimulating neurons in brain slices at beta frequencies strengthens the connections between the neurons, while stimulating the neurons at theta frequencies weakens the connections. Miller believes the same thing is happening during this learning task. ""When the animal guesses correctly, the brain hums at the correct answer note, and that frequency reinforces the strengthening of connections,"" he says. ""When the animal guesses incorrectly, the 'wrong' buzzer buzzes, and that frequency is what weakens connections, so it's basically telling the brain to forget about what it just did."" The findings represent a major step in revealing how memories are formed, says Howard Eichenbaum, director of the Center for Memory and Brain at Boston University. ""This study offers a very specific, detailed story about the role of different directions of flow, who's sending information to whom, at what frequencies, and how that feedback contributes to memory formation,"" says Eichenbaum, who was not part of the research team. The study also highlights the significance of brain waves in cognitive function, which has only recently been discovered by Miller and others. ""Brain waves had been ignored for decades in neuroscience. It's been thought of as the humming of a car engine,"" Miller says. ""What we're discovering through this experiment and others is that these brain waves may be the infrastructure that supports neural communication."" The researchers are now investigating whether they can speed up learning by delivering noninvasive electrical stimulation that oscillates at beta frequencies when the correct answer is given and at theta frequencies when the incorrect answer is given. ""The idea is that you make the correct guesses feel more correct to the brain, and the incorrect guesses feel more incorrect,"" Miller says. This form of very low voltage electrical stimulation has already been approved for use in humans. ""This is a technique that people have used in humans, so if it works, it could potentially have clinical relevance for enhancing memory or treating neurological disorders,"" Brincat says.

That's 1 percent of the global population. Four times as many men as women are afflicted with the disorder and, while the condition is not life-threatening, it is debilitating as it interferes with effective communication and erodes self-esteem and confidence. Two new studies from University of California - Santa Barbara (UCSB) researchers provide new insight into the treatment of stuttering as well as understanding its physiological basis. The first paper, published in the American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology, compares a new treatment developed at UCSB to the standard best practices protocol. The second study, which appears in the Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, uses imaging to identify abnormal areas of white matter in the brains of adult stutterers. According to co-author Janis Ingham, a professor emerita of speech and hearing sciences at UCSB and co-author of both papers, the two studies taken together demonstrate two critical points: A neuroanatomic abnormality exists in the brains of people who stutter, yet they can learn to speak fluently in spite of it. ""Together these papers break new ground, one in the treatment area and the other in neuroanatomy,"" said Roger Ingham, a professor of speech and hearing sciences at UCSB and an author on both papers. ""I decided to work with Scott Grafton in the psychology department to see whether it's possible to improve stuttering treatment by having a better knowledge of the neural systems that are functionally related to the disorder."" Roger Ingham's new Modifying Phonation Intervals (MPI) Stuttering Treatment Program takes a somewhat different approach from the current standard protocol, which teaches stutterers to prolong their speech. The intensive MPI program teaches stutterers to reduce the frequency with which they produce very short intervals of phonation while speaking. A phonated interval is the elapsed time of a voiced unit of speech. In the word ""shout,"" for example, ""out"" is a voiced (phonated) unit; ""sh"" is an unvoiced unit. The MPI program software provides real-time feedback to the stutterer regarding the occurrence of these short phonated intervals so he or she can learn to reduce their occurrence, which improves fluency. After a lengthy period of basic research and testing, the MPI program was studied in phase II clinical trials with funding from the National Institutes of Health. Ingham and his colleagues found that reducing the frequency of the speaker's short phonated intervals resulted in durable and natural-sounding fluent speech for the majority of study participants. ""It's not a five-minute job,"" said Ingham, lead author of the paper on MPI's efficacy. ""A person who stutters needs to be under this treatment system for two to three hours a day, six days a week for the first phase of the program, which lasts about three weeks."" MPI treatment is divided into four phases, each designed to be managed jointly by the person who stutters and the clinician. MPI program software is available as an app for the iPad. The clinician uses a ""master"" app to teach the stutterer how to follow the program on an iPad at home. Progress is contingent on performance. Once participants complete the initial phase, they move on to increasingly complex speaking tasks until they ultimately conquer what they deem to be their most difficult speaking situations. ""We have to be extraordinarily creative in developing some of these situations,"" Roger Ingham noted. ""We've had participants talking before classes and being interviewed by UCSB's Nobel Prize winners, but we also use Toastmasters where they get a lot of experience speaking in public."" Ingham's team is currently investigating the use of virtual reality in conjunction with the MPI treatment program. They are exploring whether those difficult speaking situations can be created more efficiently and effectively through reality versions. The study results show that outcomes for the MPI and prolonged speech treatment groups were similar. However, more people in the MPI program were able to identify and employ the specific speech behaviors necessary for successful treatment. Ingham noted that twice as many people receiving the MPI treatment were successful in maintaining naturally fluent speech 12 months after they finished the program compared to those receiving the prolonged speech treatment. But what causes stuttering in the first place? The answer appears to lie in the brain's white matter. Led by Grafton, a professor in UCSB's Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, the imaging study used diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) in an MRI scanner to examine the white matter in the brains of eight adult stutterers. DSI is able to parse tracts in the brain and follow them beyond the point where they intersect. Grafton, also a member of the campus's Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies, likens the brain's tracts to highways and surface streets, only in the brain the intersections are three-dimensional. Grafton and the paper's lead author, Matt Cieslak, a graduate student in Grafton's lab, discovered abnormalities of the arcuate fasciculus, one of the key pathways that connect the language areas of the brain. So named because it forms an arch, the arcuate fasciculus connects at the front of the brain to the area of the cerebral cortex linked to speech production. At the back of the brain, it branches into three parts. ""What's interesting is the back half,"" said Grafton. ""In the vast majority of the stutterers we scanned, there seems to be a large portion of the connection projecting into the temporal cortex, an area of the brain also critical for speech perception. Seven of eight subjects are missing this third branch of the arcuate fasciculus bundle. So in this small group, we can see a really, really strong effect."" These results required not only sensitive imaging but also completely new analysis methods to examine each tract in the brain separately and at the individual subject level. ""Big advances have allowed us to reconstruct pathways with greater detail than we were able to do before,"" said Cieslak, who developed the new analysis techniques. ""In terms of data, each subject produces what looks like a bowl of spaghetti or a ball of yarn and we had to figure out how to put that data into an analytical framework,"" he explained. ""About 40,000 lines of code later we now have a platform for analyzing white matter data, which can be expanded to a large set of subjects."" Going forward, the researchers would like to study the brains of recovered stutterers to see whether white matter actually changes with treatment. ""Is there something special in the wiring of people who recover?"" Grafton asked. ""Maybe they are missing part of the arcuate fasciculus pathway but they've got another one that's strong enough to pick up the slack. We'd like to be able to investigate that possibility using DSI."" Once treated as a psychological or emotional condition, stuttering can now be traced to brain neuroanatomy and physiology, according to the researchers. ""We're one of a number of groups making a strong case that there is something fundamentally different about the brains of people who stutter,"" Grafton said. ""I'm really excited about this work because it's transforming how we do research in patient groups with very common and challenging developmental disorders that have a great impact on people's lives but are otherwise largely ignored in neuroscience and by funding agencies,"" Grafton added. ""They get diagnosed or described and we throw therapies at them but we don't really understand the pathophysiologic basis or the biology of these problems. The fact that we can now see big changes in scans of individuals who stutter is huge. It opens up a lot of opportunities, not just for stutterers but for all kinds of developmental problem like dyslexia, childhood speech apraxia and disorders of coordination.""

Legionella bacteria cause Legionnaires  disease, a serious and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia. Infection occurs when a patient, typically elderly or with a compromised immune system, inhales water droplets containing legionella. The organisms thrive in warm, damp environments, with outbreaks linked to spas and pools, fountains and air-conditioning cooling towers. There have been Legionnaires cases linked to hose use in Brazil and the Netherlands, but Thomas  study is the first to examine legionella growth in an Australian context. Published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, the study found that legionella thrive inside garden hoses lying in the summer heat, multiplying within host cells called free-living amoebae that amplify their virulence. Legionella hide inside the amoebae to evade water disinfection measures, and the summer heat spurs their growth under conditions Thomas describes as a  microbial soup .  We were actually quite surprised at just how dense the populations of both the amoeba and also the legionella were within the hoses,  says Thomas of the study, conducted at UNSW s Water Research Centre. The legionella grow within microbial slime on the inside of the hose called biofilm   a  complex architecture of microorganisms  which dislodges in fragments and spurts out with the water when the tap is turned on. Thomas  modelling showed that the potential legionella concentration within the aerosols of a hose is comparable to that seen in Legionnaires outbreaks from public spas. The heat is key   legionella grow at between 25-42 degrees   while the amoebae switch on genes which make the bacteria  more virulent and more pathogenic  than ever, says Thomas. Though the study only examined two hoses Thomas said it was part of a growing body of evidence suggesting  a potential source of transmission that needs to be looked at further . The findings could also have broader implications for other bacteria, with species including mycobacterium, pseudomonas and parachlamydiae having similar growth requirements.  At present there s definitely enough literature or evidence to warrant larger studies of garden hoses,  she says. Until then there are a few simple measures you can take to minimise your risk.  Bacteria need water, if you hang up the garden hose to drain it will reduce the opportunity for the pathogens to regrow. ","Published: February 23, 2015"

The joint project, PeriTune, is to develop a protein expression optimisation platform for the robust production of biologics. This platform will enable key bottlenecks and manufacturability challenges of recombinant proteins used in both biopharmaceutical medicines and industrial biotechnology to be addressed.  The platform will utilise the tuneable gene expression control technology RiboTite, developed at The University of Manchester, coupled with the expertise in bioprocessing scale up at Cobra Biologics. The RiboTite technology operates at the level of translation initiation and permits cellular-level tuneable control of gene expression. Here, uniquely, this capability will be used to match expression to the periplasmic secretion capabilities of E. coli production cells. At high levels of recombinant protein overexpression the secretion pathways can become overloaded, affecting product titres and cell viability. Clones developed through the optimisation platform at The University of Manchester will be validated, demonstrated at scale, and assessed for manufacturability within Cobra Biologics. The PeriTune project will allow Cobra Biologics to investigate the use of the RiboTite technology in controlling levels of secreted protein production in E.coli, and also the manufacturing robustness of the system during fermentation scale up.  Dr Daniel Smith, CSO Cobra Biologics, said:  We are looking forward to collaborating closely with Dr Neil Dixon, his team at the University of Manchester, and their innovative RiboTite technology. This is a very exciting project for Cobra, as it has the potential to expand our current microbial production toolbox, providing alternative routes for controlling protein expression for a wide range of potential new protein-based therapeutics.  Dr Neil Dixon, The University of Manchester, commented:  We are very pleased that this funding will enable us to collaborate with Cobra Biologics and support the on-going translation of our research into industry.

The effort will focus on tools and measurements that will be used in the development and production of biopharmaceuticals, which are drugs and treatments derived from biological, rather than chemical, sources. Under the new agreement, MedImmune is providing first-year funding for seven NIST postdoctoral scientists, each working on a joint MedImmune/NIST research project. These projects will seek to better understand mechanisms of action, structures and other biological and chemical principles useful in drug development, engineering and formulation, and help create measurement tools to facilitate that knowledge.  MedImmune is committed to partnering with premier institutions that can translate strong science into patient benefit,  said Bahija Jallal, executive vice president, MedImmune.  NIST offers a unique expertise that can facilitate more precise, timely and innovative approaches to drug discovery, and being conveniently located with us in Gaithersburg, further supports the burgeoning life sciences community in Maryland.   This partnership brings together MedImmune s deep industry understanding and NIST s measurement expertise to expand our knowledge of biopharmaceuticals a growing field with huge economic and health impacts,  said Willie May, acting under secretary of commerce for standards and technology and acting NIST director. Among the initial MedImmune/NIST collaborations are: Developing a new, sensitive form of Raman spectroscopy (a technique that provides information about molecular vibrations that can be used to identify and quantify samples) to rapidly determine that proteins used in biopharmaceuticals are properly folded and able to interact with other molecules as intended; Helping researchers identify potential targets for therapeutic agents by establishing a library of the mass spectra, the  fingerprints  of molecules, for proteins on the surface of cells that have roles in specific diseases; Developing methods to produce three-dimensional structural maps with resolution at the atomic level for the largest class of proteins used for medical therapies, called monoclonal antibodies, and; Using neutron beams to understand at the molecular level why some proteins used in biopharmaceuticals unfold during their manufacture. Along with funding for the seven postdoctoral associates, MedImmune will supply NIST with monoclonal antibodies and other proprietary materials needed by the researchers. Work will be conducted at both the MedImmune and NIST campuses, which are located just over a kilometer from each other in Gaithersburg, Md. The effort will be supported by two MedImmune departments Biopharmaceutical Development and Antibody Discovery and Protein Engineering and NIST s Materials Measurement Laboratory. Access also will be provided to two NIST national user facilities, the NIST Center for Neutron Research and the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology. The research will be conducted under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), the principal mechanism used by federal laboratories to engage in collaborative efforts with nonfederal partners to achieve the goals of technology transfer. CRADAs allow the exchange of resources with private industry to advance technologies that can then be commercialized for the benefit of the public and the U.S. economy. Both parties plan to publish the results of their research under the CRADA.","Published: February 23, 2015"

The overall request includes $147.7 million in budget authority for initiatives tied to several key areas, including the implementation of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act and the management of critical medical products issues. The FY 2016 budget request reflects the FDA s commitment to fulfil the mandates of groundbreaking legislation passed in recent years, which has given the agency increased regulatory responsibilities. The FDA s scope has also expanded as it regulates an ever-increasing number of food and medical products imported from all over the world.  This budget accurately reflects the challenges FDA faces in a global regulatory environment, which is becoming increasingly complex and scientifically demanding,  said Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg, M.D.  As FDA s mission expands on several fronts   from the regulation of tobacco products to supporting the development of personalized medicine to ushering in a new era of food safety   we must possess the resources to run a modern agency that fosters innovation and ensures the safest possible drug and food supply for the American people.  Highlights of the FDA FY 2016 budget include: Implementing a New Food Safety System (+$109.5 million in budget authority): The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law by President Obama in 2011, required sweeping changes to the nation s food safety program to help prevent foodborne illness, resulting in multiple new regulations and a substantial strengthening of the agency s food inspection capabilities. The FY 2016 budget request will allow the FDA to: implement fundamental requirements for domestic food and feed safety; acquire the technical staffing needed to support the law, including the training of new inspectors; provide the appropriate guidance to industry about the changes the law will bring; strengthen the role of the states in helping to ensure the safety of the country s food supply; and build and implement a new import safety system. Improving the Safety and Quality of Medical Products (+$33.2 million in budget authority): Medical products regulated by the FDA are crucial to the health of Americans and impact nearly every aspect of medical care in the United States. The FDA s FY 2016 request seeks to improve safety and quality and support innovation across the entire spectrum of regulated products. Key priorities include: combating the growing threat of antibiotic resistance; facilitating the development and appropriate use of reliable molecular and genetic diagnostics   also known as precision medicine tools   to  personalize  the diagnosis and treatment of disease; implementing key requirements of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act; addressing the safety of compounded drugs and medical products; and implementing the Sunscreen Innovation Act. Building a More Modern FDA (+$5.0 million in budget authority, plus $24.0 million already included in the prior highlights): Five major pieces of groundbreaking legislation passed since 2009 have greatly increased the FDA s responsibilities. As the agency s mandate expands, more scientists, doctors, analysts and inspectors are needed to fulfill the FDA s evolving mission. The FDA s staffing needs must increase by 70 percent by FY 2016, compared to FY 2008. The FDA requires additional funding for rental payments and a feasibility study to update and issue a revised Master Plan for the White Oak campus in order to address its expanded workforce and the facilities needed to accommodate them.","Published: February 23, 2015"

In a review article published in Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Maya Opendak and Elizabeth Gould of Princeton University synthesize the vast literature on this topic, reviewing environmental factors that influence the birth of new neurons in the adult hippocampus, a region of the brain that plays an important role in memory and learning. The authors discuss how the birth of such neurons may help animals and humans adapt to their current environment and circumstances in a complex and changing world. They advocate for testing these ideas using naturalistic designs, such as allowing laboratory rodents to live in more natural social burrow settings and observing how circumstances such as social status influence the rate at which new neurons are born. ""New neurons may serve as a means to fine-tune the hippocampus to the predicted environment,"" Opendak says. ""In particular, seeking out rewarding experiences or avoiding stressful experiences may help each individual optimize his or her own brain. However, more naturalistic experimental conditions may be a necessary step toward understanding the adaptive significance of neurons born in the adult brain."" In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that environmental influences have a profound effect on the adult brain in a wide range of mammalian species. Stressful experiences, such as restraint, social defeat, exposure to predator odors, inescapable foot shock, and sleep deprivation, have been shown to decrease the number of new neurons in the hippocampus. By contrast, more rewarding experiences, such as physical exercise and mating, tend to increase the production of new neurons in the hippocampus. The birth of new neurons in adulthood may have important behavioral and cognitive consequences. Stress-induced suppression of adult neurogenesis has been associated with impaired performance on hippocampus-dependent cognitive tasks, such as spatial navigation learning and object memory. Stressful experiences have also been shown to increase anxiety-like behaviors that are associated with the hippocampus. In contrast, rewarding experiences are associated with reduced anxiety-like behavior and improved performance on cognitive tasks involving the hippocampus. Although scientists generally agree that our day-to-day actions change our brains even in adulthood, there is some disagreement on the adaptive significance of new neurons. For instance, the literature presents mixed findings on whether new neurons generated under a specific experimental condition are geared toward the recognition of that particular experience or if they provide a more naive pool of new neurons that enable environmental adaptation in the future. Gould and her collaborators recently proposed that stress-induced decreases in new neuron formation might improve the chances of survival by increasing anxiety and inhibiting exploration, thereby prioritizing safety and avoidant behavior at the expense of performing optimally on cognitive tasks. On the other hand, reward-induced increases in new neuron number may reduce anxiety and facilitate exploration and learning, leading to greater reproductive success. ""Because the past is often the best predictor of the future, a stress-modeled brain may facilitate adaptive responses to life in a stressful environment, whereas a reward-modeled brain may do the same but for life in a low-stress, high-reward environment,"" says Gould, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Princeton University. However, when aversive experiences far outnumber rewarding ones in both quantity and intensity, the system may reach a breaking point and produce a maladaptive outcome. For example, repeated stress produces continued reduction in the birth of new neurons, and ultimately the emergence of heightened anxiety and depressive-like symptoms. ""Such a scenario could represent processes that are engaged under pathological conditions and may be somewhat akin to what humans experience when exposed to repeated traumatic stress,"" Opendak says. Because many studies that investigate adult neurogenesis use controlled laboratory conditions, the relevance of the findings to real-world circumstances remains unclear. The use of a visible burrow system--a structure consisting of tubes, chambers, and an open field--has allowed researchers to recreate the conditions that allow for the production of dominance hierarchies that rats naturally form in the wild, replicating the stressors, rewards, and cognitive processes that accompany this social lifestyle. ""This more realistic setting has revealed individual differences in adult neurogenesis, with more new neurons produced in dominant versus subordinate male rats,"" Gould says. ""Taking findings from laboratory animals to the next level by exploring complex social interactions in settings that maximize individual variability, a hallmark of the human experience, is likely to be especially illuminating.""

That's what's suggested in a study led by Kai-Florian Storch, PhD, of the Douglas Mental Health University Institute and McGill University, which has been published in the online journal eLife. Our daily sleep-wake cycle is governed by an internal 24-hour timer, the circadian clock. However, there is evidence that daily activity is also influenced by rhythms much shorter than 24 hours, which are known as ultradian rhythms and follow a four-hour cycle. Most prominently observed in infants before they are able to sleep through the night, ultradian rhythms may explain why, on average, we eat three meals a day that are relatively evenly spaced across our daily wake period. These four-hour ultradian rhythms are activated by dopamine, a key neurotransmitter. When dopamine levels are out of kilter -- as is suggested to be the case with people suffering from bipolar disease and schizophrenia -- the four-hour rhythms can stretch as long as 48 hours. With this study, conducted on genetically modified mice, Dr. Storch and his team demonstrate that sleep abnormalities, which in the past have been associated with circadian rhythm disruption, result instead from an imbalance of an ultradian rhythm generator (oscillator) that is based on dopamine. The team's findings also offer a very specific explanation for the two-day cycling between mania and depression observed in certain bipolar cases: it is a result of the dopamine oscillator running on a 48-hour cycle. This work is groundbreaking not only because of its discovery of a novel dopamine-based rhythm generator, but also because of its links to psychopathology. This new data suggests that when the ultradian arousal oscillator goes awry, sleep becomes disturbed and mania will be induced in bipolar patients; oscillator imbalance may likely also be associated with schizophrenic episodes in schizophrenic subjects. The findings have potentially strong implications for the treatment of bipolar disease and other mental illnesses linked to dopamine dysregulation.

The beginning of adolescence is associated with seeking new experiences and increasing exploratory behaviors, but little research has been done to measure that increase or to look at what happens in the brain during this period,  said study author Andrew Kayser, MD, PhD, with the University of California San Francisco and a member of the American Academy of Neurology.  Studies with adults have begun to look at individual differences in willingness to seek new experiences, and some studies have tied willingness to explore with an area of the brain called the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for higher level decision-making.  The study involved 62 girls between the ages of 11 and 13 who completed a task that measured their exploratory and experimenting behavior. They also underwent MRI brain scans. The reward-based task involved a clock face. The second hand of the clock made a complete rotation over five seconds. The girls were told that they would earn points based on when they stopped the second hand. As a result, they had to explore the clock by stopping it at different times in order to learn what action would be rewarded most. Based on their behavior on the task, the group was split into 41  explorers  and 21  non-explorers.  The researchers then compared their brain scans and identified a connection that was stronger in explorers than in non-explorers between the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex and the posterior insula and putamen, parts of the brain sensitive to the  state of the body  and  carrying out actions,  respectively. Interestingly, activity in the putamen and insula seemed to influence the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, rather than the other way around.  This research is fascinating because it could help us to understand how exploration can lead to both good and bad behaviors that promote or reduce well-being in teenagers,  said Kayser.  If we can better understand these brain connections, down the road we may be able to come up with a way to better identify teens most likely to engage in dangerous or risky behaviors.

When they get out of whack, the cell can't function normally. In the brain, mitochondrial failure can set the stage for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other forms of neurodegeneration. Fortunately there is a group of ""night watchmen,"" proteins that monitor mitochondrial function and sound the alarm if a mitochondrion has failed and needs to be replaced. One of these proteins, called CHIP, is essential for maintaining mitochondrial health. When CHIP is absent or there is not enough of it, nerve cells cannot recover when, for example, a stroke disrupts their supply of oxygen and glucose. The critical role of CHIP was reported recently in the journal Antioxidants and Redox Signaling by researchers at Vanderbilt University. Their report has spurred efforts to develop CHIP-enhancing drugs to help speed recovery from strokes and following neurosurgery, and prevent development of neurodegenerative disorders. ""If we can do a better job of maintaining these mitochondria ... that's a very, very powerful tool to have,"" said senior author BethAnn McLaughlin, Ph.D., assistant professor of Neurology and Pharmacology. Among the major findings the authors uncovered ""profound impairments"" at both the anatomical and biochemical levels in mice with the CHIP gene deleted, or ""knocked out."" They're smaller than their normal littermates, their back legs are weak, and they die young. ""They're 30 days old and they look like they're 150,"" McLaughlin said. Using a mass spectrometry technique developed by Vanderbilt proteomics pioneer and co-author Dan Liebler, Ph.D., and his colleagues, graduate student Amy Palubinsky confirmed for the first time that CHIP goes to the mitochondria when cells are stressed by lack of oxygen, for example. She also found that in the absence of CHIP, nerve cells from these animals are much more vulnerable to oxygen and glucose deprivation and are ""loaded"" with damaged proteins that impair their functioning. Palubinsky is first author on the paper and a Vanderbilt Clinical Neuroscience Scholar. Palubinsky said the cellular changes seen in the CHIP knockout mice were the same as those her group previously detected in postmortem human samples from people who'd had strokes or ""transient ischemic attacks,"" which interrupt the brain's oxygen and glucose supplies. ""That gives us a new model system to ... look deeper and see what the mechanisms"" are,"" she said. The Vanderbilt team is now collaborating with medicinal chemist Jason Gestwicki, Ph.D., at the University of California, San Francisco, to test potential CHIP-enhancing drugs he has developed. ""We're moving (toward) trying that in cells, (and) in animal models of stroke and Parkinson's disease,"" McLaughlin said. They also are working with David Charles, M.D., professor of Neurology at Vanderbilt and a pioneer in deep brain stimulation to relieve symptoms of Parkinson's disease, to develop imaging tests that can pick up changes in the mitochondria before the cells die.

The studies are being funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and conducted by the NIAID-funded HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN). The oral anti-HIV medication Truvada (a combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), made by Gilead Sciences, is currently the only antiretroviral drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for daily use in combination with safer sex practices to prevent HIV infection; Truvada is also approved by the FDA for HIV treatment. Studies have shown, however, that some people at greatest risk for HIV infection may have difficulty adhering to a daily pill regimen to protect against HIV acquisition - an approach called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. Hence, researchers have pursued long-acting formulations of antiretroviral drugs that can be given much less frequently, with the hope of improving adherence.  A safe, long-acting, injectable antiretroviral capable of protecting against HIV acquisition may serve as an attractive and feasible alternative to a daily pill for some individuals at highest risk for HIV infection and could, therefore, be a powerful HIV prevention tool,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. The HPTN 076 trial, which will be conducted in South Africa, the United States and Zimbabwe, is a Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and acceptability of rilpivirine LA, a long-acting injectable form of the FDA-approved antiretroviral drug rilpivirine (TMC278) from Janssen Sciences Ireland UC. The study is expected to enroll 132 women ages 18 to 45 years who are not infected with HIV and who are considered at low-risk for HIV infection. Volunteers will be randomly assigned to the rilpivirine LA study arm (88 study participants) or a placebo (44 study participants). Those participants assigned to receive the active product will first receive an oral tablet of rilpivirine (25 mg) to be taken once daily for four weeks, followed by two gluteal, intramuscular injections of rilpivirine LA at eight-week intervals for 10 months. Study participants assigned to the placebo group will first receive daily oral placebo for four weeks followed by two gluteal, intramuscular placebo injections once every eight weeks for 10 months. Study participants will be counseled at each clinic visit on how to protect against HIV infection. After the treatment period, study participants will be followed for eight months after the last set of injections to evaluate their effect. PATH, an international nonprofit organization based in Seattle, is the regulatory sponsor of the HPTN 076 trial. It is being conducted in collaboration with Janssen Sciences Ireland UC and NIAID. The HPTN 077 Phase 2 trial, sponsored by NIAID, will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and acceptability of injectable GSK1265744 (cabotegravir), an investigational antiretroviral drug from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) that is being simultaneously developed for both HIV treatment and prevention in oral and injectable form. In recently published results External Web Site Policy, GSK1265744 proved effective at protecting 12 of 14 female monkeys from a simian form of HIV when administered via injection. The HPTN 077 study, which will be conducted at eight sites in Brazil, Malawi, South Africa and the United States, is expected to enroll 176 HIV-uninfected men and women between the ages of 18 to 65. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group will receive a daily oral tablet of GSK1265744 or an oral placebo for four weeks, followed by a one-week break to assess safety and tolerability.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/solving-carbon-mysteries-of-the-deep-ocean-209770,Solving Carbon Mysteries of the Deep Ocean New research from MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute reveals a hidden deep ocean carbon cycle  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Understanding how oceans absorb and cycle carbon is crucial to understanding its role in climate change. For approximately 50 years, scientists have known there exists a large pool of dissolved carbon in the deep ocean, but they didn t know much about it - such as the carbon s age (how long it s been in organic form), where it came from, how it got there, and how long it s been there, or how these factors influence its role in the carbon cycle. Now, new research from scientists at MIT and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) provides deeper insights into this reservoir and reveals a dynamic deep-ocean carbon cycle mediated by the microbes that call this dark, cold environment home. The work, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests the deep ocean plays a significant role in the global carbon cycle, and has implications for our understanding of climate change, microbial ecology, and carbon sequestration. For years, scientists thought that carbon of varying ages made up the deep-ocean reservoir and fueled the carbon cycle, but nobody could prove it.  I ve been trying for over 20 years,  said Daniel Repeta, a senior scientist in marine chemistry and geochemistry at WHOI and co-author of the study.  Back then we didn t have a good way to go in and pull that carbon apart to see the pieces individually. We would get half-answers that suggested this was happening, but the answer wasn t clear enough,  he says. With the help of Daniel Rothman, a professor of geophysics in MIT s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), and Chris Follett, a postdoctoral associate in Mick Follows  group and formerly of Rothman s group, Repeta would soon find the answers he was looking for. Follett thought a next-generation method called a step-wise oxidation test might be able to reveal the age distribution of the carbon pool. The team exposed water samples taken from the Pacific Ocean to ultraviolet radiation, which converts organic carbon to carbon dioxide. The gas was then collected and measured for radiocarbon, which Follett used to estimate the carbon isotopes  ages and cycling rate.  At a minimum there are two widely separated components - one extremely young and one extremely old, and this young component is fueling the larger flux through the dissolved carbon pool,  he says. In other words, the youngest source of dissolved organic carbon in the deep ocean originates from the surface, where phytoplankton and other marine life fix carbon from the atmosphere. Eventually these organisms die and sink down the water column, where they dissolve and are consumed by microbes. Because it takes 1,000 years for the ocean s surface waters to replace bottom waters, scientists thought the few-centuries-old carbon, some of which is anthropogenic, couldn t possibly contribute to the deep ocean pool. That s no longer the case. The researchers found that as particulate organic carbon sinks through the water column and dissolves, some of it is sequestered in the reservoir and respired by microbes. The results suggest a more active carbon cycle in the deep ocean bolstered by bacteria that utilize the reservoir as a food source.  We previously thought of the deep ocean as a lifeless and very slow system,  Repeta says.  But those processes are happening much faster than we thought.  If this microbial pump is in fact more robust, then it gives more credence to the idea of using the mechanism to sequester carbon in the deep ocean - a concept some scientists have been working on in recent years. While some carbon in the reservoir may cycle faster, older carbon cycles much slower. This is because older sources such as hydrothermal vents, methane seeps, and ocean sediment produce carbon that isn t easily consumed. However, these sources are often disregarded in analyses of the marine carbon cycle because they are considered too small in magnitude to be significant. But when Follett accounted for them in calculating the reservoir s turnover, or the time it takes for carbon to completely cycle, what he found was astounding. The turnover time of the older portion of the reservoir is 30,000 years - 30 times longer than it takes for the ocean itself to cycle - which indicates these sources may be relevant.  To find something that is more consistent with the biochemical story was fun and surprising,  says Follett.  A lot of people have proposed these ideas over the years, but they haven t had the evidence to back them up. It was nice to come in and give them the evidence they needed to support these ideas.  So what do these findings mean for the climate system? In the short term, not much. But on a longer time-scale, one that spans thousands of years, it could affect projections of the amount of atmospheric and sequestered carbon.  It potentially has a very important influence on climate through its role in sequestration of carbon away from the atmosphere,  says Mick Follows, an EAPS associate professor in the Program of Atmospheres, Oceans, and Climate, who was not involved in the study.  If some radical change occurred that changed the nature of that pool, then it could have an effect on climate through greenhouse gas  influence on the atmosphere.  Such changes might include, for example, deep-ocean temperature fluctuations affecting microbial activity, or a shifting surface ocean environment that could affect plankton and other organisms from which dissolved organic carbon originates.

Now they're using a new $490,000 grant to identify those genes and figure out how they work. Identifying those stress-control genes and understanding their function could help create trees that can resist the very things that can kill them, said C.J. Tsai, the lead researcher on the project. Tsai, a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar and professor with joint appointments in UGA's Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources and the department of genetics in the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, has been working for years on ways to create better-growing threes. Key to that is making them more resistant to stressful scenarios like extreme temperatures, disease and drought-but first they need to zero in on the genes that help with that. ""Successfully manipulating one or more of the genes under stressful scenarios could lead to better-growing trees, and the results could also be translated to food crops,"" said Tsai, who is also director of the Plant Center at UGA. ""The implications of this project could be far-reaching."" Tsai and her team already have one candidate gene family from a previous study. The nucleoredoxin genes produce small redox proteins involved in cellular redox regulation. These genes were turned on when they increased salicylic acid in poplars. While they gear up to identify additional candidates, the team will manipulate the nucleoredoxin genes to see the effects on plant stress response. This project, funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, follows a previous study in which Tsai's team reported that the levels of salicylic acid-a naturally occurring chemical that protects plants from harmful environmental changes-could be greatly increased in poplar trees without stunting growth, which had been a common problem in other plants. Those findings are valuable to this new project, she said. Salicylic acid is very important to plants because it regulates processes like photosynthesis and defenses against abiotic and biotic stresses-temperature, drought and disease. ""All those stresses promote the generation of damaging oxidants, and salicylic acid is thought to mitigate some of the damaging effects,"" Tsai said. In the previous study, they identified many metabolites and genes that responded to increased salicylic acid. ""It turned out that many of those genes and metabolites were also increased when control trees were grown under heat stress,"" Tsai explained. ""That's when we realized that trees overproducing salicylic acid created an opportunity for identifying novel stress-mitigating genes. It's like these trees have been  stress-primed' by salicylic acid."" In the new project, Tsai and fellow UGA researchers Scott Harding and Liangjiao Xue, also dually housed in Warnell and the genetics department, and Magdy Alabady in the plant biology department will compare tree responses to heat, drought and elevated levels of salicylic acid to identify genes that act downstream of salicylic acid to trigger defense. They also will study the involvement of small RNAs in this regulation. RNAs are molecules that convey genetic information from DNA into proteins. Unlike typical genes that code for proteins, small RNA genes produce only small RNAs, but no proteins. The small RNAs are known to play important roles in plant defense as well as in animals by regulating the function of other genes. By integrating the information they can obtain about gene expression, metabolite profiling and small RNA regulation from these trees, the researchers hope to identify novel cascades of cellular events that regulate plant stress tolerance. Tsai said poplars were chosen for the studies because of their naturally high levels of salicylic acid compared to other plants, and also because they are a common biofuel feedstock. Tsai's team is involved in two other new USDA grants that could have far-reaching implications:  Her lab is collaborating with scientists at Penn State University, who are looking at how poplar trees respond to the Asian longhorned beetle, one of the most threatening invasive pests in the U.S. Tsai and Harding will receive about $100,000 from a $450,000 grant for the project, led by Penn State's Kelli Hoover. They'll be analyzing tissue samples for differences in a class of phenolic glycosides between American and Asian poplars to identify clues that would explain why the exotic tree is resistant to the beetle but native trees are not.  With a $100,000 exploratory grant, Tsai and collaborators Alabady and Xue are investigating why some trees like poplar, oak and cherry flower early in the spring without leaves, while others like eucalyptus, chestnut and crepe myrtles don't flower until much later and require the presence of leaves. The new grant will allow them to compare pollen gene expression profiles of the early- and late-flowering tree species. They are particularly interested in carbohydrate metabolism genes-genes involved in synthesis, transport and use of sugars-because early- and late-flowering trees need to obtain sugars through different pathways to sustain the pollen development. The findings could have a significant impact on multiple research fields, Tsai said. ""Flowering is key to breeding and crop productivity and is highly sensitive to climate change and plays many ecological roles through its interaction with bees and insects,"" she said. ""Flower development is also an important focus of basic research, and most of our knowledge about flower development comes from studies with annual plants, such as petunias and snapdragons. However, trees grow and reproduce for decades in harsh and changing environments, and how they manage their resources to ensure their reproductive success needs to be better understood.""","Published: February 21, 2015"

In a new study published in the journal Astrobiology, researchers from Imperial College London and the Natural History Museum replicated a technique that one of the Curiosity Rover's on-board instruments is using to analyze soil samples, in its quest to find organic compounds. They tested a combination of jarosite and organic compounds. They discovered that the instrument's technique -which uses intense bursts of heat called flash-heating - broke down jarosite into sulphur dioxide and oxygen, with the oxygen then destroying the organic compounds, leaving no trace of it behind. The concern is that if jarosite is present in soil samples that Curiosity analyses, researchers may not be able to detect it because both the jarosite and any organic compounds could be destroyed by the flash-heating process. In 2014, Professor Mark Sephton, co-author of today's study, investigated the mineral perchlorate. This mineral also causes problems for flash-heating experiments as it breaks down to give off oxygen and chlorine gas, which in turn react with any organic compounds, breaking them down into carbon dioxide and water. Professor Sephton showed that though perchlorate was problematic, scientists could potentially use the carbon dioxide resulting from the experiment to detect the presence of organic compounds in the sample being analyzed. Professor Sephton, from the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London, said: ""The destructive properties of some iron sulphates and perchlorate to organic matter may explain why current and previous missions have so far offered no conclusive evidence of organic matter preserved on Mars' surface. This is despite the fact that scientists have known from previous studies that organic compounds have been delivered to Mars via comets, meteorites and interplanetary dust throughout its history."" To make Curiosity's search for signs of life more effective, the team are now exploring how Curiosity might be able to compensate for the impact of these minerals on the search for organic compounds. Their work could have important implications for both the Curiosity mission and also the upcoming European-led ExoMars 2018 Rover mission, which will be drilling for subsurface samples of the red planet and using the same flash-heating method to look for evidence of past or present alien life. James Lewis, co-author of the study from the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London, added: ""Our study is helping us to see that if jarosite is detected then it is clear that flash-heating experiments looking for organic compounds may not be completely successful. However, the problem is that jarosite is evidence of systems that might have supported life, so it is not a mineral that scientists can completely avoid in their analysis of soils on Mars. We hope our study will help scientists with interpreting Mars data and assist them to sift through the huge amount of excellent data that Curiosity is currently generating to find signs that Mars was once able to sustain life."" On Earth, iron sulphate minerals like jarosite form in the harsh acidic waters flowing out of sulphur rich rocks. Despite the adverse conditions, these waters are a habitat for bacteria that use these dissolved sulphate ions. This makes these minerals of great interest to scientists studying Mars, as their presence on the red planet provide evidence that acidic liquid water was present at the same time the minerals formed, which could have provided an environment favourable for harbouring ancient microbial Martian life. On board Curiosity, the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument analyses soil samples for evidence of organic compounds by progressively heating samples up to around 1000 C, which releases gases. These gases can then be analyzed by techniques called gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, which can identify molecules in the gas and see if any organic compounds are present. It is these SAM instrument experiments that the researchers behind today's study replicated with jarosite and organic compounds. The researchers stress that not all sulphates break down to react with organic compounds. For example, those containing calcium and magnesium would not break down until extremely high temperatures were reached during the analysis, and therefore would not affect any organic compounds present. The team suggest that if jarosite is found in samples on Mars, then it may be possible for Curiosity's SAM instrument to distinguish a spike in carbon dioxide level, which, as Professor Sephton has shown previously with perchlorate, would act as an indicator that organic material is present and being broken down by the heating process. The next step will see the researchers using synthetic jarosite in their experiments, which will enable a cleaner decomposition process to occur when the mineral is flash-heated. This will allow for more precise quantitative measurements to be taken when the oxygen is being released. Ultimately, they hope this will enable more precise calculations to be carried out on Mars mineral samples to find ways in which Curiosity can identify the presence of these mineral to mitigate their impact on organic matter. The jarosite samples used in the experiments in the study were collected from Brownsea Island in Dorset, with the permission and assistance from the National Trust.","Published: February 21, 2015"

The new findings could lead to new treatments for allergic diseases, and will help to predict who will best respond to currently available treatments. This new study, published in Nature and led by scientists at Imperial College London, has taken 10 years involving researchers in the UK, US, Canada and Sweden, who have used new ways to study the genes in the immune system. The team looked at epigenetic changes, which do not affect the genetic code itself but which influence the activity of genes. Using this approach, the researchers were able to pinpoint genes that regulate a particular antibody that is involved in triggering allergic responses. This antibody, called immunoglobin E (IgE), was known to researchers already but before today's study scientists had been unable to identify which genes regulate its activities. The new study turned to epigenetics to look for new therapeutic targets. Genes can be rendered inactive by attaching methyl molecules to the DNA, a process called methylation. The researchers analyzed white blood cells from families with asthma in the UK to see whether methylation levels in certain parts of the genome were correlated with the level of IgE in the blood. To be sure of their results, the researchers tested whether they held true in additional volunteers with high and low levels of IgE from Wales and further asthmatic families from Quebec. They found strong associations between IgE and low methylation at 36 places in 34 genes. In people with asthma, these genes are overactive, making them produce more IgE which contributes to asthma symptoms. Some of the IgE-related genes were known to encode proteins produced by eosinophils, a type of white blood cell that promotes inflammation in asthma sufferers' airways. The researchers believe these genes may activate the eosinophils, priming them to cause the most damage. To test this idea, they isolated eosinophils from the blood of 24 subjects and showed that all 34 genes are most active in asthmatics with high IgE levels. Therapies that neutralize eosinophils already exist, but they are very expensive and only effective in some asthmatics. The newly found activation signals provide a possible means of identifying which patients will respond before starting therapy. The study was led by Professor William Cookson and Professor Miriam Moffatt from the National Heart & Lung Institute at Imperial College London. Professor Moffatt said: ""The genes we identified represent new potential drug targets for allergic diseases as well as biomarkers that may predict which patients will respond to existing expensive therapies."" Professor Cookson said: ""Our pioneering approach, using epigenetics, allowed us to obtain insights that we weren't able to get from traditional genetics. It isn't just the genetic code that can influence disease and DNA sequencing can only take you so far. Our study shows that modifications on top of the DNA that control how genes are read may be even more important."" The Freemasons' Grand Charity, the Wellcome Trust and grants from the Qu bec Government provided the principal funding for the study.","Published: February 21, 2015"

NICE first developed the briefings in 2013 to help boost and speed-up the uptake of innovative and promising technologies which have the potential to improve patient health and increase NHS productivity. Medtech Innovation Briefings provide a description of a medical technology, including its likely place in therapy, the costs of using the technology and a critical review of the strengths and weaknesses of the relevant published evidence. The purpose of the MIB is to provide objective information on device and diagnostic technologies to aid local decision-making by clinicians, managers and procurement professionals. By making this information available, NICE helps to avoid the need for NHS organizations to produce similar information for local use. The NICE MIB has been developed on ZedScan as an adjunct to colposcopy in women with suspected cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia. The ZedScan system is used alongside colposcopy on women identified with an abnormal smear result. ZedScan offers clinical benefits by identifying those patients who require treatment at first visit, reducing the number of cervical biopsies performed on each patient by pin-pointing the optimum site for biopsy and reducing follow-up appointments - benefiting the patient and the hospital. These benefits translate into better health economics as identified in an independent report by the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR). The MIB states that this economic evaluation is a  well executed document with a clear statement of limitations and assumptions.  Pg 28, NICE Medtech Innovation Briefing 20 (2015). The NICE MIB for ZedScan identifies three key benefits from the report:  For both the 'see and treat' and 'triage' clinics, the model showed a reduction in overtreatment, adverse events and related treatment costs.  Lower biopsy rates were associated with the ZedScan, with 1-1.02 biopsies per woman having colposcopy with the ZedScan compared with 1.72 with standard care, and this reduced related costs.  A cost saving was also illustrated from the reduction in follow-up colposcopy appointments over the timeframe of the model.  Pg 26 - 27, NICE Medtech Innovation Briefing 20 (2015) ZedScan is a portable and non-visual/non-optical system. The MIB also states that  NICE is not aware of any other CE Marked devices that have a similar function to the ZedScan . Pg 8, NICE Medtech Innovation Briefing 20 (2015) The NICE MIB follows the publication of a peer-reviewed multi-centre study in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, and the health economics evaluation and a real-clinic case study on over 500 patients.","Published: February 21, 2015"

BIOTECHNICA:The name BIOTECHNICA has been associated with new business leads and networking in the fields of biotechnology and life sciences in Germany and Europe for 30 years. Industry and science alike use the forum to find products, technologies and opportunities for cooperation. BIOTECHNICA is the only trade fair to cover the entire red, white and green biotechnology value chain - from basic research to the finished product. Featuring marketplaces for bioeconomy and personalized medicine technologies, BIOTECHNICA 2015 will focus on the sector s overall significance for society, key issues and innovative strength. The range covered by BIOTECHNICA includes the entire biotechnological process chain: process engineering, analytics and sensor technology, bioinformatics, biotechnological applications in industry, pharmaceuticals, medicine and agriculture, and biotech services such as financing or consulting. LABVOLUTION:LABVOLUTION presents the entire world of lab equipment for laboratories focussing on research, analysis, production and training. The new trade fair covers the whole range of lab equipment products and services for a variety of target markets, including chemistry, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, synthetic materials, material development, cosmetics, medical and environmental technology and the food industry, and shows how laboratories are an integral part of the entire value chain. In addition to its focus on generating new business leads and networking, LABVOLUTION will also serve as a platform at which the latest laboratory-related trends and issues of future relevance can be discussed. In this regard, one of the highlights of the trade fair s premiere will be the SmartLAB - an intelligent prototype laboratory of the future. Overall, the range of topics covered by LABVOLUTION will include lab equipment and infrastructure, analytics, commodities and consumables, reagents and chemicals, applications and processes, and specialized services. European Lab Automation (ELA):The ELA conference and trade fair is Europe s largest event dedicated to automation in the life sciences field. ELA is staged by the British organizer SELECTBIO. ELA has been held annually since 2011, with Hamburg having hosted the event three times and Barcelona being the most recent venue. In Hannover, the ELA exhibition will be part of LABVOLUTION for all three days of the event. Conference participants will meet in the Convention Center, which is directly adjacent to the exhibition hall, on 7 and 8 October. ELA incorporates three conferences: Lab Automation and Robotics, Genome Engineering and Personalized Medicine. Lab Automation and Robotics will showcase preparation techniques for extracted cell material and human tissue samples. The Genome Engineering conference track will focus on both new and established technologies and their discovery, development and application in various organisms. Most notably, applications for CRISPR/Cas9 in therapeutics will be explored. The conference will be completed by Personalized Medicine, which will cover emerging and established laboratory-developed tests and provide insights into the changing legislation and funding landscape.","Published: February 21, 2015"

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a state between normal ageing and dementia, where someone's mind is functioning less well than would be expected for their age. It affects 19% of people aged 65 and over, and around 46% of people with MCI develop dementia within 3 years compared with 3% of the general population. The latest review paper, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, analysed data from 62 separate studies, following a total of 15,950 people diagnosed with MCI. The study found that among people with MCI, those with diabetes were 65% more likely to progress to dementia and those with psychiatric symptoms were more than twice as likely to develop the condition. ""There are strong links between mental and physical health, so keeping your body healthy can also help to keep your brain working properly,"" explains lead author Dr Claudia Cooper (UCL Psychiatry). ""Lifestyle changes to improve diet and mood might help people with MCI to avoid dementia, and bring many other health benefits. This doesn't necessarily mean that addressing diabetes, psychiatric symptoms and diet will reduce an individual's risk, but our review provides the best evidence to date about what might help."" The Alzheimer's Society charity recommends that people stay socially and physically active to help prevent dementia. Their guidelines also suggest eating a diet high in fruit and vegetables and low in meat and saturated fats, such as the Mediterranean diet. ""Some damage is already done in those with MCI but these results give a good idea about what it makes sense to target to reduce the chance of dementia,"" says senior author Professor Gill Livingston (UCL Psychiatry). ""Randomised controlled trials are now needed."" Professor Alan Thompson, Dean of the UCL Faculty of Brain Sciences, says: ""This impressive Systematic Review and meta-analysis from The Faculty of Brain Science's Division of Psychiatry underlines two important messages.

Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute and Department of Neuroscience. Results of the study were published in Neuron. As depicted in the film  The Imitation Game,  Alan Turing and his team of codebreakers devised the statistical technique to help them decipher German military messages encrypted with the Enigma machine. (The technique today is called Wald s sequential probability ratio test, after Columbia professor Abraham Wald, who independently developed the test to determine if batches of munitions should be shipped to the front or if they contained too many duds.) Finding pairs of messages encrypted with the same Enigma settings was critical to unlocking the code. Turing s statistical test, in essence, decided as efficiently as possible if any two messages were a pair. The test evaluated corresponding pairs of letters from the two messages, aligned one above the other (in the film, codebreakers are often pictured doing this in the background, sliding messages around on grids). Although the letters themselves were gibberish, Turing realized that Enigma would preserve the matching probabilities of the original messages, as some letters are more common than others. The codebreakers assigned values to aligned pairs of letters in the two messages. Unmatched pairs were given a negative value, matched pairs a positive value. Starting at different points in the messages, the codebreakers began adding and subtracting. When the sum reached a positive or negative threshold, the two messages were deemed a pair from machines with the same setting, or not. Neurons in the brains of rhesus monkeys do the same thing when faced with decisions, says Michael Shadlen, MD, PhD, professor of neuroscience at Columbia and an HHMI investigator. In his study, Dr. Shadlen and co-first authors Shinichiro Kira, a former member of Dr. Shadlen s lab and currently at Harvard Medical School, and Tianming Yang, of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, recorded the activity of neurons in the brains of two monkeys as they made a simple decision: look at a sequence of symbols on a computer screen, one after another, and whenever ready, choose between two spots for a reward. To make the correct decision the one that brought a reward the monkeys had to weigh different clues encoded in the symbols that flashed onto the screen. Some of the eight symbols were unreliable clues about the reward s location; others were more dependable. And the monkeys had to think fast. Each symbol appeared for only 250 milliseconds. As the monkeys watched the symbols, recordings of their neurons revealed how they came to a decision. Each symbol contributed a positive value (reward is in the left spot) or negative value (reward is in the right spot) to the accumulated evidence, which was represented in the neuron s firing rate. More reliable symbols had a larger impact on the firing rate than less reliable symbols. Just as in the Turing s code breaking, once a positive or negative threshold was reached, the decision was deemed complete and the monkey indicated its choice. Assuming that humans have the same capabilities and that s a good bet, says Dr. Shadlen it means our brains are weighing probabilities and making rational decisions in very short periods of time.  It s the basis of a very basic kind of rationality,  he says. These types of decisions are mostly unconscious on our part.  They re decisions like,  I m going to pick up a book,  or  I m going to walk toward the left of the coffee table, not the right,  Dr. Shadlen adds.  We make lots of these decisions every day, and it turns out, we re making them by using the laws of probability in a way that statisticians think is optimal.

The study, which is published in the journal Science, marks the first time this method of analysis has been used on such a large scale on such complex tissue. The team studied over three thousand cells, one at a time, and even managed to identify a number of hitherto unknown types. ""If you compare the brain to a fruit salad, you could say that previous methods were like running the fruit through a blender and seeing what color juice you got from different parts of the brain,"" says Sten Linnarsson, senior researcher at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics. ""But in recent years we've developed much more sensitive methods of analysis that allow us to see which genes are active in individual cells. This is like taking pieces of the fruit salad, examining them one by one and then sorting them into piles to see how many different kinds of fruit it contains, what they're made up of and how they interrelate."" The knowledge that all living organisms are built up of cells is almost 200 years old. Since the discovery was made by a group of 19th century German scientists, we have also learnt that the nature of a particular body tissue is determined by its constituent cells, which are, in turn, determined by which genes are active in their DNA. However, little is still known about how this happens in detail, especially as regards the brain, the body's most complex organ. In the present study, the scientists used large-scale single-cell analysis to answer some of these questions. By studying over three thousand cells from the cerebral cortex in mice, one at a time and in detail, and comparing which of the 20,000 genes were active in each one, they were able to sort the cells into virtual piles. They identified 47 different kinds of cell, including a large proportion of specialized neurons, some blood vessel cells and glial cells, which take care of waste products, protect against infection and supply nerve cells with nutrients. With the help of this detailed map, the scientists were able to identify hitherto unknown cell types, including a nerve cell in the most superficial cortical layer, and six different types of oligodendrocyte, which are cells that form the electrically insulating myelin sheath around the nerve cells. The new knowledge the project has generated can shed more light on diseases that affect the myelin, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). ""We could also confirm previous findings, such as that the pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex are functionally organized in layers,"" says Jens Hjerling-Leffler, who co-led the study with Dr Linnarsson.

The study analysed interactions between 506 unselected adult patients and 13 GPs recorded in five general practices in London, England. Of those, 49 consultations included discussions about sickness certification -- both for the first time for some patients and repeat certification for others. The study identified four main ways that doctors recommended certification, including: statements of need for certification; ""do you need"" offers of certification; ""do you want"" offers, and; conditional offers. The first two indicate a greater patient entitlement. In the main, the recommendations made to patients presenting with physical symptoms showed stronger doctor endorsement and patient entitlement. The recommendations made to patients presenting with mental health issues displayed weaker doctor endorsement and patient entitlement. A short hand interpretation of these findings would suggest that it is easier to obtain a sick note if a patient presents with physical symptoms, than for those who present with mental illness. This is likely to reflect the complex two-way relationship between mental illness and worklessness which both patients and GPs may be aware of. Professor Richard Byng from Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, commented: ""We undertook this study because these negotiations were clearly strained and nuanced. Our findings show that it appears to be 'easier' to get a sick note for physical conditions, yet it would be remiss to accept this at face value. Patients presenting with mental health issues require a more complex response from their GP, as being off work can, in different situations, be either harmful or helpful to mental health. The round-about way in which patients elicited offers of sick notes from GPs, and the low entitlement indicated in the GPs' offers suggests that both parties may have been aware of the complex social pressures being played out in the consulting room."" He added: ""The new fit-for-work scheme, being piloted at the moment, if sensitive to individual patients' needs, may provide valuable support to patients and make these difficult encounters easier for all.""

This adaptability contributes to the bacteria s survival inside their host. Researchers at the Vetmeduni Vienna now demonstrated that the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes adapts its metabolism specifically to the host genotype. The bacterial metabolic fingerprint correlated with the susceptibility of the infected mouse strain. The researchers published their results in the journal Plos One.     Bacteria are known to specifically adapt to host environments. Understanding these adaptation mechanisms is crucial for the development of effective therapeutics. Mouse lineage influences bacterial metabolism Monika Ehling-Schulz s group from the Institute of Microbiology, together with Mathias M ller s group at the Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics studied the influence of host organisms on bacterial metabolism. The researchers infected three different lineages of mice with the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes. The mouse strains showed significant differences in their response to the infection and in the severity of the clinical symptoms. The researchers isolated the bacteria days after infection and analysed them for changes in their metabolism. They used a specific infrared spectroscopy method (FTIR) to monitor metabolic changes. The chemometric analysis of the bacterial metabolic fingerprints revealed host genotype specific imprints and adaptations of the bacterial pathogen.    Our findings may have implications on how to treat infectious diseases in general. Every patient is different and so are their bacteria , first author Tom Grunert states. Memory effect in bacteria After isolation from the mice, all bacteria were cultured under laboratory conditions. After prolonged cultivation under laboratory conditions all three bacterial batches switched back to the same metabolic fingerprint.  Based on our results it can be assumed that bacteria have some sort of memory. It takes some time under host-free laboratory conditions for this  memory effect  to vanish,  explains the head of the Institute, Monika Ehling-Schulz. Vibrating molecules decipher bacterial metabolism The researchers employed a technique known as Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to monitor the metabolism in the bacteria. An infrared beam directed through the bacteria causes molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides and fatty acids to vibrate. The molecules variably allow more or less light to pass. The different molecular composition in the bacteria yields different spectral data providing information about the molecules inside.  This method is used especially in microbiological diagnostics to identify bacteria. But we refined the method to decipher and monitor differences in the metabolic fingerprint of the same bacteria,  says Grunert. In the future, the researchers want to extend the concept to other species of bacteria and further study the impact of host organisms on pathogens. In a next step, the team plans to find out what exactly it is, that leads to metabolic changes in bacteria.","Published: February 20, 2015"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/distinguishing-normal-from-cancerous-tissue-192574,Distinguishing Normal From Cancerous Tissue FAU study demonstrates a potentially faster and more accurate mode of cancer treatment with new laser technology  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Surgeons rely on 200-year-old technology when removing cancer--sight and touch--to determine how much to remove and what to leave alone. Laser technology pioneered at Florida Atlantic University has the promise to help a surgeon better determine if an area is cancer or healthy tissue. Moreover, when combined with laser treatment for cancer, this work lays the groundwork for laser robotic treatment of cancer. Raman spectroscopy is an invaluable tool used by scientists for bioimaging and tissue diagnosis. In a study recently published in Lasers in Surgery and Medicine Journal, scientists and physicians in the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science at Florida Atlantic University have broadened the applicability of Raman spectroscopy by showing that it can be used to distinguish normal from cancerous residual skin tissue following high-powered laser ablation. This is the first time that Raman spectroscopy has been successfully used to detect cancerous tissue following laser ablation, setting the stage to use this technique as a guide for laser surgery. Scientists hope to one day employ Raman spectroscopy clinically in tandem with laser-ablative removal of skin cancers and possibly even other forms of cancers as well.    I think the most important finding of this study for dermatologists and their patients is that it demonstrates the feasibility of a potentially much faster and more accurate mode of skin cancer treatment based entirely on laser technology,  said Andrew C. Terentis, Ph.D., lead scientist of the study and an associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry in FAU s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. Cancerous tissue is diagnosed using a Raman laser and the cancerous tissue is removed in a very precise, localized fashion using an ablation laser. This type of Raman-based technique for skin cancer diagnosis and treatment, although not yet fully developed, may one day obviate the need for a more costly and time-consuming treatment method like Mohs micrographic surgery, at least in some, if not all, clinical cases. This study combined laser ablation for highly precise, hemostatic removal of cancerous tissue, with Raman spectroscopy to objectively and non-destructively probe the ablated tissue area in situ for any remaining cancer to remove. Raman spectra were collected from partially-ablated normal and squamous cell carcinoma samples and a spectral classification model based on principal component analysis with logistic regression correctly identified spectra from residual cancerous tissue with 95 percent sensitivity and 100 percent specificity.  Successful clinical implementation of the proposed surgical method could greatly enhance the speed and effectiveness of skin cancer treatment, especially if real-time analysis of the process were developed,  said Terentis. Mohs micrographic surgery is currently the gold-standard technique for skin cancer removal because it provides high cure rates while removing the least amount of healthy tissue. However, it is time consuming, resource-intensive, and the intraoperative evaluation of the excised tissue sections by histopathology is subjective. With Mohs surgery, the physician serves as surgeon, pathologist and reconstructive surgeon and relies on the accuracy of a microscope to trace and ensure removal of skin cancer down to its roots. This procedure allows dermatologists, trained in Mohs Surgery, to see beyond the visible disease, and to precisely identify and remove the entire tumor, leaving healthy tissue unharmed.  Terentis  collaborators include co-author John Strasswimmer, M.D., Ph.D., affiliate faculty in FAU s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, and a skin cancer specialist and director of the Melanoma and Cutaneous Oncology Program at the Lynn Cancer Institute and Moffitt Cancer Network. Partial funding was provided by the Sinai Hospital of Detroit.  When a surgeon removes a cancer, whether it be with Mohs surgery for skin cancer or a surgeon using a robot in a modern operating room for abdominal cancer, the surgeon must rely on vision and touch to help decide initially how much tissue to remove,  said Strawswimmer.  This new work with professor Terentis sets the stage for us to have an automatic laser to vaporize cancer and the Raman spectroscopy to tell us when to stop the vaporization process. This is particularly important in areas that we can access with the laser beam such as the lungs or inside the liver that are otherwise very difficult to access with traditional surgery. We designed this study with skin cancer, because it is a very straightforward model study and the number of skin cancer patients is increasing at an exponential rate.  According to the American Academy of Dermatology, current estimates are that one in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime. More than 3.5 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, are diagnosed in more than 2 million people in the United States every year. It is estimated that 137,310 new cases of melanoma, 63,440 noninvasive (in situ) and 73,870 invasive, will be diagnosed in 2015. This year, it is estimated that one in 50 Americans will develop melanoma in their lifetime.","Published: February 20, 2015"

Based in the Innovation Centre on Norwich Research Park, Food Forensics has been awarded UKAS accreditation to ISO17025:2005 for the measurement and interpretation of stable isotope compositions in food, beverage and feedstuffs. It is the only laboratory in the UK to have been awarded the accreditation to date. Food Forensics Managing Director Alison Johnson said:  Achieving our UKAS accreditation is the result of a great deal of hard work and commitment from the Food Forensics team and provides our customers, who are facing increasing risks of food fraud, accredited testing solutions. We are very appreciative of all our customers who have supported us during the accreditation process.  Although food authenticity and origin has always been high on the public s agenda, the horsemeat scandal in 2013 placed the food industry under intense scrutiny; completely undermining consumer confidence in the food industry. The subsequent publication of the Elliott Review in September 2014 made it increasingly important for businesses to demonstrate their due diligence when verifying product claims. Food Forensic analyses the stable isotopic compositions of individual foods or beverages and compares these to its authentic reference datasets to establish the validity of claims on the label. The company has developed a wide portfolio of solutions covering both country of origin claims (country or region) and verification of production system (organic, free range etc). The company s customers include primary producers and processors through to blue chip retailers who insist on optimum due diligence and risk profiling to help protect their product integrity. Food Forensics is working with its customers to establish robust Food Fraud Risk Management systems and test modelling to mitigate and monitor risk. Food Forensics has also established a strategic partnership with Centre Testing International (CTI), which operate in over 30 labs across China. CTI is one of the largest and fastest growing testing companies in China. Food Forensics has been selected as CTI s partner to establish a stable isotope testing laboratory in Shanghai. The Shanghai laboratory will be commissioned in February 2015 and will initially focus on developing solutions for the local market, as well as providing Food Forensics with reference datasets of authentic Chinese export products.

The three products are the Morrison s Fajita Meal Kit, the Aldi Fiesta brand Fajita Dinner Kit which the FSA issued allergy alerts on 12 and 14 February and a batch of Discovery Taco Seasoning, for which an allergy alert has been issued on 16 February. Investigations indicated that a spice mix supplied by Santa Maria UK Ltd used in the three products contained undeclared almond protein. Subsequent industry testing revealed that the paprika in the spice mix was the most likely source. Further investigations into the supply chain of paprika are continuing. These product withdrawals are in addition to a batch of Bart's Ground Cumin which was withdrawn from sale on 31 January because of the undeclared presence of almond. There is no evidence this was linked to the Santa Maria UK Ltd products. The FSA has said that people with a nut allergy who have bought these products should not consume them, but should return them to where they were purchased. The levels of almond protein found in these products are low and no cases of allergic reactions linked to the affected products have been reported to the FSA. Jason Feeney, Chief Operating Officer at the FSA, said: 'The FSA is investigating these incidents and, where potential problems are identified, we are alerting the public. We are dealing with this as part of our normal incident response, and our first priority is for the safety of allergic consumers. 'There is no evidence of food fraud at this stage but the Food Crime Unit will be involved if evidence of food crime emerges.' The undeclared almond protein was identified as part of a sampling programme initiated by the FSA after certain batches of ground cumin and products containing ground cumin tested positive for undeclared peanut protein in the US and Canada. The FSA will be asking the food industry to ensure that paprika products are included in their testing regimes.

One of the challenges of treating DMD is that the disease can be caused by mutations to a number of different DNA sequences, few of which occur with any substantial frequency. The new technique, however, gets around this sticking point by targeting a large region of the gene that contains many different mutations. The study was published on Feb. 18 online in Nature Communications.  There are no effective therapies currently available for people with DMD,  said Charles Gersbach, assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Duke University.  DMD patients are in a wheelchair by age 10 and typically die in their 20s. They have nothing to stop this right now -- and we re trying to work on that.  DMD is caused by problems with the body s ability to produce dystrophin, a long-chain protein that binds the interior of a muscle fiber to its surrounding support structure. Dystrophin is coded by a gene with 79 genetic  chunks  called exons. If any one exon gets a debilitating mutation, the chain does not get built. Without dystrophin providing support, muscle tends to shred and slowly deteriorate.  The disease affects one in 3,500 newborn males. The mutation is on the X chromosome so female children with two copies of X should have at least one functioning copy of the gene.  While some clinical trials are under way for drugs that restore dystrophin production from mutant genes, they only target one exon and thus can only be used for up to 13 percent of DMD cases. The new approach, however, can theoretically target any region of the gene of any size. In this study, the researchers targeted a span of 11 exons that account for 60 percent of DMD cases.  A shortened dystrophin protein is the hallmark of a variation of the disease called Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD). While the effects of BMD can vary widely, many patients live long, full lives, and some people live with the disease their entire lives without any significant effects. Gersbach s goal is to transform DMD into BMD by cutting out the genetic chain links that are most often problematic -- exons 45 through 55. To shorten the genetic code, he is turning to a bacterial viral defense system called CRISPR. Over the past decade, researchers discovered the CRISPR system that bacteria use to slice the DNA of invading viruses. Soon after its discovery, researchers hijacked the system and began using it to fix mistakes in the human genome.  What makes CRISPR exciting is that it is easy, cheap and fast to work with compared to other methods scientists have been developing in the past decade,  said David Ousterout, a graduate student in the Gersbach lab and first author of the study.  The researchers programmed CRISPR to make cuts to the dystrophin gene before the 45th and after the 55th exon. Sometimes only one cut is made and the body repairs the damage. Sometimes both cuts are made, but the cell stitches the whole sequence back together. But sometimes, after both cuts are made, the middle of the gene floats away before the cuts can be repaired -- and that s the outcome Gersbach is after. If it sounds like an inefficient process, that s because it is. Even though CRISPR is continually cutting the gene for several days, human cells are very good at repairing DNA damage. But due to the sheer volume of cuts specifically at the target site, a significant fraction of the dystrophin genes are effectively altered. In the new study, Gersbach and his team demonstrated that the technique works on cultured muscle cells taken from DMD patients. They also implanted these cells into mice and showed the treated cells began making human dystrophin.   We still need to improve the efficiency and ensure the safety of the CRISPR-based approach,  said Gersbach.  We also need to tackle the challenge of how this would be delivered to a DMD patient. We still have a long way to go, but this is a very promising start. ","Published: February 20, 2015"

Victims can t smell or see radiation around them, and low-level exposure doesn t result in obvious bodily injury. The likely outcome: long lines of patients with no visual symptoms, panicked and difficult to assess. Duke University researchers are developing a blood test that can tell in just hours how much radiation a person has absorbed from a nuclear incident. During a large-scale emergency such as the meltdown at the Japanese Fukushima Daiichi reactors in 2011, faster testing could give doctors and patients clarity about the extent of exposures and which victims need medical care. This month, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, awarded Duke an additional $10.4 million contract to continue the program through early 2016, bringing total funding since 2009 to more than $43 million. The multi-gene test, called a biodosimeter, comprises the work of scientists under the leadership of Dr. Nelson Chao, M.D., M.B.A., at Duke University; Dr. Frederic Zenhausern, Ph.D., M.B.A., at the University of Arizona; and scientists at Thermo Fisher Scientific and DxTerity Diagnostics. DxTerity representatives said they expect to take the biodosimeter to the Food and Drug Administration for approved medical use within the next three years. The project builds on almost a decade of study at Duke of the human response to ionizing radiation, said Gary Phillips, Duke s BARDA program manager. The key to the test lies in a gene signature that indicates radiation absorption in the body. Researchers Dr. Holly Dressman, Ph.D., Dr. Joseph E. Lucas, Ph.D., and John Chute, M.D., at the Duke Cancer Institute first detected this gene signature in 2007 while comparing blood-based gene expression in healthy patients to patients who had undergone full-body radiation. In 2009, Duke partnered with DxTerity and the University of Arizona to develop a high throughput radiation exposure system, a process that uses robotics and other automation to run large-scale experiments in a relatively short amount of time. The system uses a genomic testing platform from DxTerity that can use a blood sample to detect the radiation gene signature. DxTerity s direct-from-blood test eliminates the need to first isolate RNA from the blood sample, saving time and money.  If cleared, the radiation absorption test would be the first direct-from-blood, multiplex gene expression test approved by the FDA, and would open the door for other direct-from-blood gene assays,  said Bob Terbrueggen, founder and CEO of DxTerity. The company designed the technology to allow labs around the world to run other direct-from-blood tests on existing infrastructure and at a relatively low cost. If the radiation test is cleared by the FDA, approved labs across the country would be trained to use the technology and government agencies could potentially stockpile test kits for emergencies. Duke s gene signature research and the DxTerity genomic testing system have other potential applications in clinical medicine. They could provide a method to evaluate a cancer patient s tolerance for radiation treatment and to predict radiation-induced side effects in various types of cancers. The DxTerity platform is also being used to develop low-cost tests for rheumatoid arthritis and even flu detection. In the near future, gene expression-based testing could also spot early indicators of heart conditions or liver cancer. With the creation of the biodosimeter test and associated technologies, adapting it to other applications would be a matter of simply  rekeying a lock,  Phillips said.","Published: February 20, 2015"

Bacteria living inside the gut can have beneficial, but potentially also harmful effects on human health. Further studies are needed to determine whether restricting acetate production by gut bacteria will affect growth of tumors.  With insights generated from our current studies, we may be able to design therapies that treat cancer patients by modulating acetate production in the body,  said Dr. Joseph Garcia, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine at UT Southwestern and staff physician-scientist at the VA North Texas Health Care System. The work is published in the February issue of the journal PLoS ONE. Cancer, the second leading cause of death in the US, is estimated to account for nearly 1 out of every 4 deaths in 2014. It can have a significant impact on length and quality of life, which carries a tremendous economic burden. Cancer can develop in any part of the body and some are notoriously difficult to treat, although recent discoveries from basic science laboratories hold great promise for more effective treatments and potential cures. In cancer cells, low oxygen and low glucose conditions turn on signaling pathways that allow otherwise healthy cells to survive these stresses. UT Southwestern researchers previously discovered a critical pathway that controls the response of cells and organs to low oxygen conditions, a state known as hypoxia. In this study, the researchers show that the production of acetate is also stimulated by low glucose conditions, another condition frequently found in solid tumors. Acetate, in turn, activates a molecular pathway that ultimately results in the production of several proteins that stimulate the growth and spread of tumors.  Our study shows that acetate functions in this context as a growth signal for cancer cells, one that links changes in metabolism within cancer cells that occur during tumor growth with activation of a selective stress-signaling pathway. This same signaling pathway is normally protective in healthy individuals. In fact, stimulating this pathway in anemic mice without cancer has a profound effect on restoring red blood cell levels to near-normal or normal levels, and is otherwise very safe  said Dr. Garcia, a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.  The challenge facing us now is to define which patients may benefit from having this pathway stimulated and which patients will benefit from having this pathway inhibited. Preclinical studies of this nature are essential for informing the pharmaceutical and federal health oversight agencies about potential benefits as well as potential harms that may result from use of compounds that affect this key signaling pathway,  said Dr. Garcia.","Published: February 20, 2015"

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/statins-may-not-lower-parkinsons-risk-282972,Statins may not lower Parkinson s risk The use of statins may not be associated with lowering risk for Parkinson s disease  PD   according to a new study led by researchers at Penn State College of Medicine and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The use of statins may not be associated with lowering risk for Parkinson's disease (PD), according to a new study led by researchers at Penn State College of Medicine and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The findings cast doubts on reports suggesting that the cholesterol-lowering medications may protect against this neurodegenerative brain disorder. According to the National Parkinson Foundation, Parkinson's disease affects about one million Americans and an estimated four to six million people worldwide. Although the cause of PD is unknown, damage to dopamine-producing neurons eventually leads to the movement disorders that are a hallmark of the disease. Xuemei Huang, professor of neurology and vice chair for research, Penn State College of Medicine, previously reported an association between high blood cholesterol levels and lower incidence of PD. A low incidence of heart attack and stroke in PD patients in movement disorder clinics, despite their usually advanced age motivated these studies. Other studies also reported similar findings. However, evidence has been somewhat inconsistent. The use of statins has also been associated with a lower incidence of PD in several recent epidemiology studies, leading some researchers to hypothesize that these medications, which lower levels of LDL -- bad cholesterol -- may protect against PD. Those studies, however, failed to account for cholesterol levels prior to the widespread use of statins in the U.S. population, Huang said, noting that as a strength of the new study. The researchers looked at blood cholesterol levels, medications and PD status in participants in the ongoing, long-term Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. Cholesterol readings were taken at three-year intervals over the course of a decade from 1987 to 1989, before widespread statin use began. ""We confirmed our previous finding that high total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were associated with a lower risk of PD,"" Huang said. ""Moreover, statin use over the course of the study did not protect against PD, and in fact appeared to increase PD risk in the long term. Although the analysis on statin use and PD was based on a fairly small number of PD cases, this preliminary data argues against the hypothesis that statins protect against PD."" The researchers reported their finding in the journal Movement Disorders. ""One possibility,"" Huang said, ""is that statin use can be a marker of people who have high cholesterol which itself may be associated with lower PD risk. This could explain why some studies have found an association between use of these medications and low incidence of PD. Most importantly, this purported benefit may not be seen over time."" Future research should focus on if and why cholesterol may protect against PD. Although blood cholesterol is not indicative of cholesterol in the brain, there is increasing evidence that PD may begin outside the brain. Statin-induced decreases in blood cholesterol levels may have unknown consequences in these peripheral areas. A compound called coenzyme Q10 that is produced alongside cholesterol may also be an area of future PD research. Statins reduce coenzyme Q10, which helps produce energy for cells and is hypothesized to have protective qualities in nerve cells. ""Statins have been proven to be effective in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events and stroke. Although some have proposed that statins might be a 'cure-all' drug,"" Huang said, ""this might be a case where what's good for the heart isn't good for the brain."" An estimated 43 million Americans currently take statins or are eligible for statin therapy. Recent updates to American Heart Association guidelines are expected to increase that number to 56 million or more. The new guidelines recommend statin use for some patients without high cholesterol but who have other risk factors for heart disease and stroke. ""Statins have been very important for preventing and treating vascular disease, but we need more research to understand if in some cases there is collateral damage,"" Huang said. Until more epidemiological and basic research can be conducted to further parse out the associations between PD, cholesterol and statins, physicians and scientists should be cautious in promoting health benefits of statins for PD without a good understanding of clinical evidence and potential biological mechanisms, Huang advises. Patients and physicians considering statins for cardiovascular health and stroke prevention should consider their individual cases. ""This is evidence that personalized medicine is better than a one-size-fits-all approach,"" Huang said.

These two components -- nature and nurture -- seem to affect very different processes in the context of Alzheimer's disease, according to a new study published in the journal Nature. The study was carried out by an interdisciplinary team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Broad Institute, and was co-led by Li-Huei Tsai, the Picower Professor at MIT and director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, and Manolis Kellis, a professor in MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The researchers analyzed changes that occur in genes and in regions that regulate genes as Alzheimer's disease progresses, using a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease that Tsai's lab originally developed several years ago. The mice were engineered so that the gene for a protein called p25 can be overstimulated in the brain, which prompts the mice to develop symptoms very similar to Alzheimer's disease in humans. ""These programmable mice allowed us to study, for the first time, the changes occurring during early stages of the disease, before symptoms even begin to appear,"" Tsai says. ""We could then compare them to changes in later stages of the disease, when neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment are evident."" The researchers profiled multiple chemical modifications, known as epigenetic marks, in the hippocampus of mice expressing too much p25 and compared them with control mice. These epigenetic marks reveal the activity of diverse genomic regions -- in particular, the regulatory control regions that control the expression of nearby genes. The researchers also directly profiled the levels of all genes. ""We found two opposing signatures associated with disease progression that are consistent with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease,"" says Elizabeta Gjoneska, joint first author of the paper and a postdoc at the Picower Institute. ""Neuronal plasticity processes that are involved in learning and memory were dampened, and immune and inflammatory pathways were activated."" The active regions specifically matched regions active in a type of immune cells known as microglia, which are responsible for clearing away infected or damaged cells. They also secrete chemicals that produce inflammation. ""Our data suggest that microglia are heavily activated during Alzheimer's disease progression, although it is unknown exactly how they contribute to the disease,"" Tsai says. ""These cells are important for normal brain function and share their key cell-surface markers, CD14, with macrophages that infiltrate the brain from elsewhere in the body during disease progression."" The researchers then compared the results in mice with what is known about Alzheimer's disease in humans. They found that differences in gene levels in the Alzheimer's-like mouse brain matched differences previously seen in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, which prompted them to ask if the epigenetic signatures might also be conserved. The researchers found that this was the case -- specifically, the same regulatory regions that were active or repressed in mice showed the same patterns in humans. They also found that the regions with increased activity in the mouse model of Alzheimer's disease had immune functions in humans, and the regions that showed decreased activity had neural functions in humans. ""Our results show that functional conservation between human and mouse is not restricted to protein-coding genes,"" says Andreas Pfenning, joint first author of the study and a postdoc at MIT. ""This opens up the use of epigenomics methods in model organisms to study an inaccessible organ like the brain, and how it changes in response to activity or disease."" Previous studies of the genomes of Alzheimer's patients had identified common genetic variants associated with the disease, but scientists did not know how these DNA variants could contribute to the disease, since the majority of them are found outside of protein-coding regions. ""Our conserved epigenomic maps allowed us to now place these noncoding genetic variants in the context of disease-relevant regulatory regions and interpret their contribution to the disease predisposition,"" Kellis says. ""As inherited common genetic variants always precede disease onset, they are always indicative of causal roles, and thus can shed additional light on the epigenomic alterations."" The researchers found that genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease were only associated with immune processes, and not with neural processes, indicating that genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease primarily affects the circuitry of immune processes, rather than neuronal processes. ""Our results suggest that repression of neural pathways does not represent genetic predisposition, even though it is a hallmark of Alzheimer's,"" Tsai says. ""Instead, it may occur as a consequence of environmental factors and aging, and result from interactions with the altered immune pathways."" The researchers identified a small number of master regulators that target many of the regulatory regions that overlap Alzheimer's-associated genetic variants in humans. Among these, PU.1 targets a large number of altered regulatory regions, and the genetic region encoding PU.1 is associated with Alzheimer's disease, suggesting PU.1 as a potential therapeutic target. ""The new focus on immune-cell types, and the specific regulators uncovered, provide new therapeutic avenues,"" Kellis says. ""Moreover, the conservation of epigenomic signatures between mouse and human provides a platform upon which we can test such therapeutics and their effect on cognition, pathology, and the epigenomic signatures of Alzheimer's.""

The research, led by Lilia Iakoucheva, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry, is published in the journal Neuron. The researchers studied a set of well-known autism mutations called copy number variants or CNVs. They investigated when and where the genes were expressed during brain development. ""One surprising thing that we immediately observed was that different CNVs seemed to be turned on in different developmental periods,"" said Iakoucheva. Specifically, the scientists noted that one CNV located in a region of the genome known as 16p11.2, contained genes active during the late mid-fetal period. Ultimately, they identified a network of genes that showed a similar pattern of activation including KCTD13 within 16p11.2 and CUL3, a gene from a different chromosome that is also mutated in children with autism. ""The most exciting moment for us was when we realized that the proteins encoded by these genes form a complex that regulates the levels of a third protein, RhoA,"" said Iakoucheva. Rho proteins play critical roles in neuronal migration and brain morphogenesis at early stages of brain development. ""Suddenly, everything came together and made sense."" Further experiments confirmed that CUL3 mutations disrupt interaction with KCTD13, suggesting that 16p11.2 CNV and CUL3 may act via the same RhoA pathway. RhoA levels influence head and body size in zebrafish, a model organism used by geneticists to investigate gene functions. Children with 16p11.2 CNV also have enlarged or decreased head sizes and suffer from obesity or are underweight. ""Our model fits perfectly with what we observe in the patients,"" said Guan Ning Lin, PhD, a fellow in Iakoucheva's laboratory and co-first author with Roser Corominas, PhD. Interestingly, the RhoA pathway has recently been implicated in a rare form of autism called Timothy syndrome, which is caused by the mutation in a completely different gene. ""The fact that three different types of mutations may act via the same pathway is remarkable,"" said Iakoucheva. ""My hope is that we would be able to target it therapeutically."" Iakoucheva and colleagues are planning to test RhoA pathway inhibitors using a stem cell model of autism. ""If we can discover the precise mechanism and develop targeted treatments for a handful of children, or even for a single child with autism, I would be happy,"" she said.

After smelling and consuming a meal, such as a glob of sugar, information about the food's energy content is relayed via dopaminergic neurons to a fruit fly's olfactory long-term memory center. High-energy meals generated a more powerful dopamine signal, making it more likely that the fly would remember the odor of the meal when it was next encountered and choose it over other options. Flies had only short-term memories of low-energy meals. The researchers--neuroscientists Pierre-Yves Musso, Paul Tchenio, and Thomas Preat at the CNRS and ESPCI-ParisTech in Paris, France--believe that long term memory formation helps fruit flies avoid pursuing food sources that would be a waste of energy.

Because they are harvested from adult organisms, there are no ethical objections to their use, and they therefore open up major possibilities in biomedicine. For instance, adult stem cells enable the stabilization or even regeneration of damaged tissue. Neural stem cells form a reservoir for nerve cells. Researchers hope to use them to treat neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. T bingen researchers led by Professor Olga Garaschuk of the University of T bingen s Institute for Physiology, working with colleagues from Yale University, the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology in Martinsried and the Helmholtz Center in Munich, studied the integration of these cells into the pre-existing neural network in the living organism. The results of their study have been published in the latest edition of Nature Communications. There are only two places in the brains of adult mammals where stem cells can be found   the lateral ventricles and the hippocampus. These stem cells are generating neurons throughout life. The researchers focused on a stem cell zone in the lateral ventricle, from where progenitors of the nerve cells migrate towards the olfactory bulb. The olfactory nerves which start in the nasal tissue run down to this structure, which in mice is located at the frontal base of the brain. It is there that the former stem cells specialized in the task of processing information on smells detected by the nose.  Using the latest methods in microscopy, we were for the first time able to directly monitor functional properties of migrating neural progenitor cells inside the olfactory bulb in mice,  says Olga Garaschuk. The researchers were able to track the cells using special fluorescent markers whose intensity changes according to the cell s activity. The study showed that as little as 48 hours after the cells had arrived in the olfactory bulb, around half of them were capable of responding to olfactory stimuli. Even though the neural progenitor cells were still migrating, their sensitivity to odorants and their electrical activity were similar to those of the surrounding, mature neurons. The mature pattern of odor-evoked responses of these cells strongly contrasted with their molecular phenotype which was typical of immature, migrating neuroblasts.  Our data reveal a remarkably rapid functional integration of adult-born cells into the pre-existing neural network,  says Garaschuk,  and they show that sensory-driven activity is in a position to orchestrate their migration and differentiation as well as their decision of when and where to integrate.

The study is published in the journal Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The condition can cause sudden blindness or stroke and can be life-threatening. The varicella zoster virus, of the herpes virus family, can cause chicken pox and may reactivate later in life in the form of shingles, a very painful rash. ""Our analysis, which is the largest to-date, provides compelling evidence that the virus also reactivates in people over 60 in another way, triggering giant cell arteritis,"" said study author Don Gilden, MD, Professor of Neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver and a Fellow of the American Academy of Neurology. Giant cell arteritis causes swelling and tenderness of the arteries on the scalp and temples of people over the age of 50. Gilden noted that it is the most common type of inflammation of blood vessels in the elderly, affecting an estimated 29 out of 100,000 people. Symptoms include a new severe headache, scalp tenderness, jaw discomfort, blurred vision, fever, weight loss and tiredness. Importantly, the cause of this condition has been uncertain, prompting the present study. For the study, researchers searched for evidence of the virus in 13 temporal artery biopsies of people who died and had no previous symptoms of giant cell arteritis and in 84 temporal artery biopsies of people with giant cell arteritis. All of the biopsies were from people over the age of 50. The virus was found in 74 percent of the biopsies with giant cell arteritis and in only 8 percent of the normal skin biopsies. ""If the association can be replicated in other studies, clinical trials should focus on treating people with giant cell arteritis with a combination of the current steroid drugs used for the condition, plus anti-viral treatment for the virus,"" said Gilden.

Using a biomaterial matrix of porous silk, the new system is capable of producing platelets for future clinical use and also provides a laboratory tissue system to advance study of blood platelet diseases. ""There are many diseases where platelet production or function is impaired,"" says Alessandra Balduini, M.D., research associate professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Tufts, associate professor at the Department of Molecular Medicine at the University of Pavia and co-corresponding author on the paper. ""New insight into the formation of platelets would have a major impact on patients and healthcare.  In this tissue system, we can culture patient-derived megakaryocytes -- the bone marrow cells that make platelets -- and also endothelial cells, which are found in bone marrow and promote platelet production, to design patient-specific drug administration regimes."" The new system can also provide an in vitro laboratory tissue system with which to study mechanisms of blood disease and to predict efficacy of new drugs providing a more precise and less costly alternative to in vivo animal models. ""The need for platelet production systems to treat patients with related diseases is significant. This patient-specific system could provide new insight and options for clinical treatments,"" says David Kaplan, Ph.D., chair of biomedical engineering and Stern Family professor at Tufts and co-corresponding author. ""Further the platelets can be generated on demand, avoiding the complications of storage problems, and in greater quantities and with better quality and control in terms of morphology and function."" The work is pre-published online in the journal Blood prior to print publication. Producing Platelets in Silk Bioreactor Platelets can be life-saving or life-threatening. These cells keep us from bleeding to death from injuries by enabling our blood to clot, but they also play a pathological role in heart attacks and strokes, inflammation and cancer. Contained in spongy bones, the bone marrow microenvironment and its ""niches"" support production of platelets and other blood cells. Mature blood cells pass between the bone marrow and the blood stream through blood vessels containing endothelial cells and extracellular matrix components (ECM) that are important for healthy blood cell production. The special properties of silk protein were essential to successfully mimicking this microenvironment, explains Kaplan, a leading researcher on silk and other novel biomaterials whose laboratory has bioengineered silk-based models for the brain and other tissue. ""Silk protein possesses a unique molecular structure that enables it to be modeled in a wide variety of forms and stiffnesses, characteristics that have been shown to affect platelet formation and release.  Furthermore, silk is biocompatible and has the ability to stabilize bioactive agents at normal temperatures; therefore we can  functionalize  it by adding such agents,"" he said. Importantly, the silk is nonactivating to platelets, meaning that it does not trigger clotting, thereby allowing the collection of functional platelets from the bioreactor. The new system combined microtubes spun of silk, collagen and fibronectin surrounded by a porous silk sponge.  Megakaryocytes   some of which were derived from patients   were seeded into the engineered microvasculature. The researchers were able to increase platelet production in the bioreactor by embedding the silk with active endothelial cells and endothelial-related molecular proteins that support platelet formation. Laboratory tests showed that the platelets being generated and recovered from the tissue system were able to aggregate and clot. While the number of platelets produced per megakaryocyte was lower than normally made in the body, the researchers note that the system represents a significant advance over previous models. The scalable nature of the bioreactor system provides engineering options to increase yields of platelets in ongoing studies. In addition to providing a platform for studying the processes that regulate platelet production and related diseases, the researchers hope the platelets produced can be used as a source of growth factors for wound healing in regenerative medicine, including healing of ulcers and burns, and stimulation of bone tissue regeneration in dentistry and maxillofacial plastic surgery. Global Collaboration The new system was developed in Italy and the United States, and research is the result of ongoing collaboration among an international research team. Six years ago, Balduini visited Tufts to discuss her ongoing studies on blood cells and matrix factors that are important in controlling blood cell functions.     ""During our discussion we realized there was potentially great synergy between her expertise in blood cells and diseases and our work on 3D tissue-engineered systems, including ongoing work on silk tubular systems for blood vessels,"" said Kaplan. ""This led to joint studies, an early model and the current system, which not only yields more platelets but is also more scalable."" Collaborative research building on the strengths of multiple investigators is critical to making this type of progress, according to Kaplan and Balduini. They also agree that involvement of a talented and motivated group of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers makes a big contribution.","Published: February 19, 2015"

This experimental vaccine regimen is based on the one tested in the U.S. Military HIV Research Program-led RV144 clinical trial in Thailand the first study to demonstrate that a vaccine can protect people from HIV infection. The HVTN 100 vaccine regimen was designed to provide greater protection than the RV144 regimen and has been adapted to the HIV subtype that predominates in southern Africa. The results of the HVTN 100 trial, expected in two years, will help determine whether or not this vaccine regimen will be tested for efficacy in a large future study in South Africa.  A safe and effective HIV vaccine is essential to reach a timely, sustained end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic,  said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.  The launch of HVTN 100 marks an important step forward in building upon the promising results of the RV144 trial to produce an HIV vaccine that could have a significant public health impact in southern Africa, where the HIV/AIDS pandemic is most pervasive.  NIAID holds responsibility for all operational aspects of the Phase I/II trial, which has a target enrollment of 252 HIV-uninfected heterosexual adults ages 18 to 40. NIAID and The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are co-funding the study along with the South African Medical Research Council, and the NIAID-funded HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) is conducting the trial. Sanofi Pasteur and Novartis Vaccines manufactured the test vaccines for the study. The HVTN 100 study is part of a larger HIV vaccine research endeavor led by a group called the Pox-Protein Public-Private Partnership, or the P5   a diverse set of public and private organizations, including NIAID, committed to building on the success of RV144. The P5 aims to produce an HIV vaccine that could have a significant public health benefit in southern Africa and to deepen scientists  understanding of the immune responses associated with preventing HIV infection. The HVTN 100 trial is being led by protocol chair Linda-Gail Bekker, M.D., Ph.D., deputy director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre at the University of Cape Town and chief operating officer of the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation in South Africa. Protocol co-chair Fatima Laher, M.D., director of the Perinatal HIV Research Unit at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, South Africa, is also heading the trial.  Our country is helping lead the way in HIV prevention research,"" said Glenda Gray, MBBCH, FCPaeds (SA), president of the South African Medical Research Council and HVTN co-principal investigator. ""A safe and effective vaccine is our best hope for stopping new HIV infections and protecting the health of our communities.  The experimental vaccine regimen tested in the RV144 trial was found to be 31.2 percent effective at preventing HIV infection 3.5 years after vaccination, although it appears to have been 60 percent effective one year after vaccination. In the HVTN 100 study, the design and schedule of the RV144 vaccine regimen have been altered to try to increase the magnitude and duration of vaccine-elicited immune responses.  HVTN 100 builds on the clues we ascertained from RV144 suggesting we could make the vaccine protection stronger and more durable,  said Dr. Bekker.  The clinical research will tell us if our hypotheses are correct.  The HVTN 100 vaccine regimen consists of two experimental vaccines: a canarypox-based vaccine called ALVAC-HIV and a gp120 protein subunit vaccine with an adjuvant that enhances the body's immune response. Both ALVAC-HIV (supplied by Sanofi Pasteur) and the protein vaccine (supplied by Novartis Vaccines) have been modified from RV144 to be specific to HIV subtype C, the predominant HIV subtype in southern Africa. In addition, the protein vaccine in HVTN 100 is using a different adjuvant than did RV144 in the hope of generating a more robust immune response. Finally, the HVTN 100 vaccine regimen will include booster shots at the one-year mark in an effort to prolong the early protective effect observed in RV144. All study participants will receive a total of eight injections over the course of a year. The volunteers will be randomly assigned to receive either the investigational vaccine regimen (210 participants) or a placebo (42 participants). The safety of HVTN 100 study participants will be closely monitored throughout the trial. In addition, the HVTN 100 study team will routinely counsel study participants on ways to protect themselves from HIV infection. The P5 is overseeing two separate but related HIV vaccine research programs in southern Africa. The Development Track, of which HVTN 100 is a part, aims to license a subtype C HIV vaccine regimen similar to the one studied in RV144. The Research Track will study new pox-protein vaccine regimens with a variety of adjuvants as part of the search for next-generation HIV vaccine candidates.  It has been a long road to reach this point,  said Dr. Laher.  People in the South African communities where HVTN 100 will take place are excited that this is a critical trial on the path toward finding a safe and effective HIV vaccine.

The findings, published in Nature, open the door to new research and development in drugs and personalized medicine to help those with autoimmune disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis. The senior author of the paper, John J. O'Shea, M.D., is the scientific director at NIH's National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. The lead author, Golnaz Vahedi, Ph.D., is a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. O'Shea's lab in the Molecular Immunology and Inflammation Branch. The study was performed in collaboration with investigators led by NIH Director, Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., in the Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch at the National Human Genome Research Institute. Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks its own cells, causing inflammation. Different tissues are affected in different diseases, for example, the joints become swollen and inflamed in rheumatoid arthritis, and the brain and spinal cord are damaged in multiple sclerosis. The causes of these diseases are not well understood, but scientists believe that they have a genetic component because they often run in families. ""We now know more about the genetics of autoimmune diseases,"" said NIAMS Director Stephen I. Katz, M.D., Ph.D. ""Knowledge of the genetic risk factors helps us assess a person's susceptibility to disease. With further research on the associated biological mechanisms, it could eventually enable physicians to tailor treatments to each individual."" Identifying autoimmune disease susceptibility genes can be a challenge because in most cases a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors is involved. Genetic studies have shown that people with autoimmune diseases possess unique genetic variants, but most of the alterations are found in regions of the DNA that do not carry genes. Scientists have suspected that the variants are in DNA elements called enhancers, which act like switches to control gene activities. Dr. O'Shea's team wondered if the alterations might lie in a newly discovered type of enhancer called a super-enhancer (SE). Earlier work in the laboratory of Dr. Collins and others had shown that SEs are especially powerful switches, and that they control genes important for the function and identity of each individual cell type. In addition, a large number of disease-associated genetic alterations were found to fall within SEs, suggesting that disease occurs when these switches malfunction. Dr. O'Shea's team began by searching for SEs in T cells, immune cells known to play an important role in rheumatoid arthritis. They reasoned that SEs could serve as signposts to steer them toward potential genetic risk factors for the disease. ""Rather than starting off by looking at genes that we already knew were important in T cells, we took an unbiased approach,"" said Dr. O'Shea. ""From the locations of their super-enhancers, T cells are telling us where in the genome these cells invest their assets - their key proteins - and thereby where we are most likely to find genetic alterations that confer disease susceptibility."" Using genomic techniques, the researchers combed the T cell genome for regions that are particularly accessible to proteins, a hallmark of DNA segments that carry SEs. They identified several hundred, and further analysis showed that they largely control the activities of genes that encode cytokine and cytokine receptors. These types of molecules are important for T cell function because they enable them to communicate with other cells and to mount an immune response. But the researchers' most striking observation was that a large fraction of previously identified alterations associated with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases localized to these T cell SEs. Additional experiments provided further evidence for a central role for SEs in rheumatoid arthritis. When the scientists exposed human T cells to a drug used to treat the disease, tofacitinib, the activities of genes controlled by SEs were profoundly affected compared to other genes without SEs. This result suggests that tofacitinib may bring about its therapeutic effects in part by acting on SEs to alter the activities of important T cell genes. ""Three types of data - the genetics of rheumatoid arthritis, a genomic feature of T cells, and the pharmacological effects of a rheumatoid arthritis drug - are all pointing to the importance of super-enhancers,"" said Dr. Vahedi. ""These regions are where we plan to search for insights into the mechanisms that underlie rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, and for novel therapeutic targets for these conditions.""","Published: February 19, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/epigenomics-of-alzheimers-disease-progression-193590,Epigenomics of Alzheimer s Disease Progression Study of epigenomic modifications reveals immune basis of Alzheimer s disease  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Our susceptibility to disease depends both on the genes that we inherit from our parents and on our lifetime experiences. These two components   nature and nurture   seem to affect very different processes in the context of Alzheimer's disease, according to a new study published today in the journal Nature. The study was carried out by an interdisciplinary team at MIT and the Broad Institute, and was co-led by Li-Huei Tsai, the Picower Professor at MIT and director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, and Manolis Kellis, a professor in MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The researchers analyzed changes that occur in genes and in regions that regulate genes as Alzheimer s disease progresses, using a mouse model of Alzheimer s disease that Tsai s lab originally developed several years ago. The mice were engineered so that the gene for a protein called p25 can be overstimulated in the brain, which prompts the mice to develop symptoms very similar to Alzheimer s disease in humans.  These programmable mice allowed us to study, for the first time, the changes occurring during early stages of the disease, before symptoms even begin to appear,  Tsai says.  We could then compare them to changes in later stages of the disease, when neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment are evident.  Opposing changes The researchers profiled multiple chemical modifications, known as epigenetic marks, in the hippocampus of mice expressing too much p25 and compared them with control mice. These epigenetic marks reveal the activity of diverse genomic regions   in particular, the regulatory control regions that control the expression of nearby genes. The researchers also directly profiled the levels of all genes.  We found two opposing signatures associated with disease progression that are consistent with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer s disease,  says Elizabeta Gjoneska, joint first author of the paper and a postdoc at the Picower Institute.  Neuronal plasticity processes that are involved in learning and memory were dampened, and immune and inflammatory pathways were activated.  The active regions specifically matched regions active in a type of immune cells known as microglia, which are responsible for clearing away infected or damaged cells. They also secrete chemicals that produce inflammation.   Our data suggest that microglia are heavily activated during Alzheimer s disease progression, although it is unknown exactly how they contribute to the disease,  Tsai says.  These cells are important for normal brain function and share their key cell-surface markers, CD14, with macrophages that infiltrate the brain from elsewhere in the body during disease progression.  Conserved epigenomic signatures The researchers then compared the results in mice with what is known about Alzheimer s disease in humans. They found that differences in gene levels in the Alzheimer s-like mouse brain matched differences previously seen in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, which prompted them to ask if the epigenetic signatures might also be conserved. The researchers found that this was the case   specifically, the same regulatory regions that were active or repressed in mice showed the same patterns in humans. They also found that the regions with increased activity in the mouse model of Alzheimer s disease had immune functions in humans, and the regions that showed decreased activity had neural functions in humans.  Our results show that functional conservation between human and mouse is not restricted to protein-coding genes,  says Andreas Pfenning, joint first author of the study and a postdoc at MIT.  This opens up the use of epigenomics methods in model organisms to study an inaccessible organ like the brain, and how it changes in response to activity or disease.  Genetic variants cluster in immune pathways Previous studies of the genomes of Alzheimer s patients had identified common genetic variants associated with the disease, but scientists did not know how these DNA variants could contribute to the disease, since the majority of them are found outside of protein-coding regions.  Our conserved epigenomic maps allowed us to now place these noncoding genetic variants in the context of disease-relevant regulatory regions and interpret their contribution to the disease predisposition,  Kellis says.  As inherited common genetic variants always precede disease onset, they are always indicative of causal roles, and thus can shed additional light on the epigenomic alterations.  The researchers found that genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease were only associated with immune processes, and not with neural processes, indicating that genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease primarily affects the circuitry of immune processes, rather than neuronal processes.  Our results suggest that repression of neural pathways does not represent genetic predisposition, even though it is a hallmark of Alzheimer's,  Tsai says.  Instead, it may occur as a consequence of environmental factors and aging, and result from interactions with the altered immune pathways.  The researchers identified a small number of master regulators that target many of the regulatory regions that overlap Alzheimer's-associated genetic variants in humans. Among these, PU.1 targets a large number of altered regulatory regions, and the genetic region encoding PU.1 is associated with Alzheimer's disease, suggesting PU.1 as a potential therapeutic target.  The new focus on immune-cell types, and the specific regulators uncovered, provide new therapeutic avenues,  Kellis says.  Moreover, the conservation of epigenomic signatures between mouse and human provides a platform upon which we can test such therapeutics and their effect on cognition, pathology, and the epigenomic signatures of Alzheimer's.   In an elegant series of experiments, the paper adds to a growing body of evidence, which began with genomewide association studies, implicating immune function in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer s disease. This potentially paves the way for exploiting peripheral myeloid cells to develop biomarkers and therapeutics to target the disease,  says David Bennett, a professor of neurological sciences at Rush University Medical Center, who was not part of the research team.","Published: February 19, 2015"

Now, an experiment at the Department of Energy s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory has supplied the most complete atomic-scale map of such a compound docked with a cellular receptor that regulates the body s pain response and tolerance.  This work will provide a solid basis for the design of a new generation of pain relievers with reduced dependency,  said Vadim Cherezov, a chemistry professor at the University of Southern California who led the research at SLAC s Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray laser, a DOE Office of Science User Facility and one of the brightest X-ray sources on the planet. The experiment is highlighted in the Feb. 16 issue of Nature Structural & Molecular Biology. Pain Relief at Work Morphine is an opioid   a drug derived from opium poppies. It works by docking with opioid receptors in cell membranes, triggering signals that act on the body s nervous system to relieve pain. There is a whole class of opioid painkillers prescribed for various conditions, and abuse and dependency is a growing problem in the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the sale of opioid pain relievers rose 300 percent from 1999-2008, and more than 12 million people in 2010 reported using prescription painkillers without a prescription or  for the feeling they cause  rather than a medical need. In the LCLS experiment, scientists studied a promising alternative opioid compound derived from a peptide   a chain of amino acids naturally produced by the body. The compound is designed to work as a powerful pain reliever while suppressing drug tolerance, in which an increasing dosage is required to achieve the same relief. Researchers docked this compound into an opioid receptor, and then used LCLS to explore the bound structure. The results provide the clearest picture yet of the complex binding of the opioid compound with the receptor. Scientists said it will aid in designing pain-relieving drugs that allow a more controlled response by the body while limiting adverse reactions. The Challenge of GPCRs Opioid receptors are one of a class of cellular receptors known as G protein-coupled receptors, or GPCRs. GPCRs are targeted by an estimated 40 percent of prescription drugs because of their key roles in cells  signaling and response; they are also involved in regulating mood and nervous system responses and enabling vision, smell and taste. GPCRs are notoriously difficult to study because they are delicate, residing in a fatty environment in cell membranes. Also, the favored method to study proteins is by forming crystals for study with X-rays, but many GPCRs are difficult to crystallize, and in some cases researchers have only been able to produce small volumes of crystals that are too small for study using conventional techniques. The incredibly bright X-ray pulses of LCLS allow researchers to study very small crystals in natural temperatures and conditions. The receptor-docked opioid samples studied at LCLS had earlier been studied in a frozen state with another X-ray source, called a synchrotron. The structural details revealed at LCLS differed from those earlier results, which researchers said may be due to the more natural conditions of the samples used at LCLS. Targeting Tiny Crystals In the LCLS experiment, conducted in February 2014, researchers prepared tiny crystals   each millionths of a meter across and containing many copies of the opioid bound to the receptor   in a toothpaste-like gel that simulates the receptor s natural environment. Then they oozed a thin stream of the gel into the ultrabright LCLS pulses. Each X-ray  hit  on a crystal produced patterns of X-ray light that allowed researchers to fully map the structure. The LCLS result is one of just a few examples of a peptide-GPCR interaction mapped at high resolution. These types of interactions are not well understood because they are more complex and difficult to study than the simpler interactions of GPCRs with smaller molecules   like a hand fitting into a glove, versus a simple lock-and-key fit. But this fuller binding mechanism could aid in developing improved drugs. Cherezov said his research team has plans to continue GPCR studies at LCLS, and added,  This latest work will be relevant for other GPCRs. Every new structure counts.

The epigenome is part of the machinery that helps direct how genes are turned off and on in different types of cells. Researchers supported by the National Institutes of Health Common Fund s Roadmap Epigenomics Program have mapped the epigenomes of more than 100 types of cells and tissues, providing new insight into which parts of the genome are used to make a particular type of cell. The data, available to the biomedical research community, can be found at the National Center for Biotechnology Information website.  This represents a major advance in the ongoing effort to understand how the 3 billion letters of an individual s DNA instruction book are able to instruct vastly different molecular activities, depending on the cellular context,  said NIH Director Francis Collins, M.D., Ph.D.  This outpouring of data-rich publications, produced by a remarkable team of creative scientists, provides powerful momentum for the rapidly growing field of epigenomics.  Researchers from the NIH Common Fund s Roadmap Epigenomics Program published a description of the epigenome maps in the journal Nature. More than 20 additional papers, published in Nature and Nature-associated journals, show how these maps can be used to study human biology.  What the Roadmap Epigenomics Program has delivered is a way to look at the human genome in its living, breathing nature from cell type to cell type,  said Manolis Kellis, Ph.D., professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, and senior author of the paper. Understanding epigenomics Almost all human cells have identical genomes that contain instructions on how to make the many different cells and tissues in the body. During the development of different types of cells, regulatory proteins turn genes on and off and, in doing so, establish a layer of chemical signatures that make up the epigenome of each cell. In the Roadmap Epigenomics Program, researchers compared these epigenomic signatures and established their differences across a variety of cell types. The resulting information can help us understand how changes to the genome and epigenome can lead to conditions such as Alzheimer s disease, cancer, asthma, and fetal growth abnormalities. The value of epigenomic data Researchers can now take data from different cell types and directly compare them.  Today, sequencing the human genome can be done rapidly and cheaply, but interpreting the genome remains a challenge,  said Bing Ren, Ph.D., professor of cellular and molecular medicine at the University of California, San Diego, and co-author of the Nature paper and several of the associated papers.  These 111 reference epigenome maps are essentially a vocabulary book that helps us decipher each DNA segment in distinct cell and tissue types. These maps are like snapshots of the human genome in action.   This is the most comprehensive catalog of epigenomic data from primary human cells and tissues to date,  said Lisa Helbling Chadwick, Ph.D., project team leader and a program director at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH.  This coordinated effort, along with uniform data processing, makes it much easier for researchers to make direct comparisons across the entire data set.   Researchers from the 88 projects supported by the program, including those from this recent series of papers, have propelled the development of new epigenomic technologies,  said John Satterlee, Ph.D., co-coordinator of the Roadmap Epigenomics Program, and program director at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), part of NIH. Satterlee added that the work of this program has served as a foundation for continued exploration of the human epigenome through the International Human Epigenome Consortium.  With this increased understanding of the full epigenome, and the datasets available to the entire scientific community, the NIH Common Fund is striving to catalyze future research, to aid the understanding of how epigenomics plays a role in human diseases, with the expectation that further studies will identify early indications of disease and targets for therapeutics,  said James Anderson, M.D., Ph.D., director of NIH Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives that oversees the NIH Common Fund. NIDA, NIEHS, and the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders are co-administrators of the NIH Common Fund s Epigenomics Program. The NIH Common Fund supports a series of exceptionally high impact research programs that are broadly relevant to health and disease. Common Fund programs are designed to overcome major research barriers and pursue emerging opportunities for the benefit of the biomedical research community at large. The research products of the Common Fund programs are expected to catalyze disease-specific research supported by the NIH Institutes and Centers.","Published: February 19, 2015"

If you know how the binding physically works, you can design molecules to target the specific receptor sites and generate specific responses,  said Vadim Cherezov, professor at the University of Southern California (USC) Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and corresponding author on a paper about the research that is published online in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology. Opioid receptors throughout the brain and spinal cord exist in four major subtypes: delta, kappa, mu, and Nociceptin receptor. The body naturally releases molecules, or  ligands,  called enkephalins, endorphins and dynorphins that bind to these receptors, regulating mood and pain. Opiate drugs like morphine try to artificially do the same thing, targeting mu receptors. While they effectively relieve pain by doing so, their prolonged use causes a growing tolerance to the drug and, ultimately, physical dependence. Previous research has shown that administering morphine with a chemical that simultaneously blocks delta receptors cuts down on those negative side effects   leading researchers to believe that there must be a way to engineer a drug that interacts with both the mu and delta receptors in such a way that it would have all of the benefits of morphine but none of the drawbacks. To that end, Cherezov and his team focused on a molecule that is structurally similar to the body s natural ligands, but operates differently   activating mu receptors while blocking delta receptors. The only problem   these receptors are incredibly difficult to image.  Drug abuse is the leading cause of injury related deaths in the United States and opioid abuse cost the U.S. approximately $58 billion in 2007. The structural data are helping to provide new insight into the understanding of how the receptors work in our body, and the design of novel molecules that might help address this critical health issue,  said Raymond Stevens, co-author of the study and director of the Bridge Institute at USC Dornsife. To figure out what a tiny biological structure looks like, scientists usually grow crystals of them and then blast those crystals with X-rays; piecing together a picture of what they look like based on the way that the X-rays bounce off of them. The process, known as X-ray crystallography, works best with rigid biological structures because their rigidity allows them to support the growth of larger crystals. X-ray beams pummel and destroy crystals quickly, and small crystals don t have the fortitude to stand up to them long enough to collect enough data. The receptors Cherezov wanted to study are highly dynamic and flexible, and typically can t grow such large crystals. Instead, Cherezov and his colleagues used a new technique that features a brighter X-ray free electron laser. While it might seem counterintuitive, blasting the crystals with a higher-intensity but very short X-ray pulses allows Cherezov to use smaller crystals at near-body temperatures, rather than cryo-cooling them.  They vaporize in an instant, but before disintegrating they reflect photons producing an image from un-damaged molecules,  Cherezov said.  The result is terabytes of data from tens of thousands of crystals, which our colleagues at the Center for Free Electron Laser Science in Hamburg help us to analyze in order to translate them into a single model for the structure.  While traditional crystallography relies on crystals being a bare minimum of 10 to 20 microns across to last long enough to be useful, the free electron laser allows Cherezov to image crystals that are two orders of magnitude smaller by volume. The resulting structural model has a resolution of 2.7 angstroms (an angstrom being roughly the length of the radius of an atom), which is precise enough to see how molecules bind with the receptor. Next, Cherezov and his colleagues plan to use X-ray lasers to study how receptors like these interact with their signaling partners, and to record a molecular movie of how these receptors transmit signals across the membrane. For this study, Cherezov and Stevens collaborated with colleagues at Scripps Research Institute, Arizona State University, Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Medical School, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron in Germany, the University of Hamburg, European XFEL GmbH in Germany, and the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal in Canada.

Summer Sheremata, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Attention and Cognition Laboratory in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, led the study. The paper, ""Hemisphere-Dependent Attentional Modulation of Human Parietal Visual Field Representations,"" was published in the Journal of Neuroscience. ""Patients with damage to the right hemisphere often fail to visually perceive objects on their left, but the reverse is much less common. That is, damage to the left hemisphere does not typically lead to deficits in attention,"" Dr. Sheremata said. ""Psychologists have hypothesized that the right hemisphere could help out the left hemisphere in attending to objects on the right, both in healthy individuals and patients recovering from stroke, but until now it remained an assumption."" The research was conducted at the University of California, Berkeley, with senior author Michael Silver, associate professor of optometry and vision science and neuroscience. Participants' brain activity was measured using fMRI while they used their attention in two different ways: The first scenario measures the visual response, confirming that the right side of the brain represents the left visual field and that the left side of the brain represents the right visual field. The second scenario tests the effects of visual attention and indicates that while the left side of the brain only focused on the right visual field, the right side of the brain was able to represent both sides of the visual field. Visual field representations are included in a figure in the study. While the research was conducted on healthy, non-stroke patients, the results suggest a possible brain mechanism for how the visual field can be recovered if it is damaged by a stroke. ""The results demonstrate that the tasks we do every day change how the brain pays attention to the world around us. By understanding how these changes occur in healthy individuals, we can focus on behaviors that are impaired in stroke patients and provide a focus for rehabilitation,"" Dr. Sheremata said. To further the research, Dr. Sheremata plans to study how these effects influence behavior in stroke patients and healthy individuals during attention and memory.

The results paved the way for a newly opened clinical trial for glioblastoma patients at Penn. ""A series of Penn trials that began in 2010 have found that engineered T cells have an effect in treating some blood cancers, but expanding this approach into solid tumors has posed challenges,"" said the study's senior author, Marcela Maus, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of Hematology/Oncology in Penn's Abramson Cancer Center. ""A challenging aspect of applying engineered T cell technology is finding the best targets that are found on tumors but not normal tissues. This is the key to making this kind of T cell therapy both effective and safe."" The new preclinical study, conducted in collaboration with Hideho Okada, MD, PhD and his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh, details the design and use of T cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that targets a mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor protein called EGFRvIII, which is found on about 30 percent of glioblastoma patients' tumor cells. More than 22,000 Americans are diagnosed with glioblastoma each year. Patients whose tumors express the EGFRvIII mutation tend to have more aggressive glioblastomas. Their tumors are less likely to respond favorably to standard therapies and more likely to recur following those treatments. ""Patients with this type of brain cancer have a very poor prognosis. Many survive less than 18 months following their diagnosis,"" said M. Sean Grady, MD, the Charles Harrison Frazier Professor and chair of the department of Neurosurgery. ""We've brought together experts in an array of fields to develop an innovative personalized immunotherapy for certain brain cancers."" The new trial is led by Donald M. O'Rourke, MD, an associate professor of Neurosurgery, who oversees an interdisciplinary collaboration of neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists, neuropathologists, immunologists, and transfusion medicine experts. Maus describes the genesis of the new results as a ""tour de force,"" in terms of the range of experiments performed to characterize the EGFRvIII CAR T cell. First, the team developed and tested multiple antibodies, or what immunologists call single-chain variable fragments (scFv), which bind to cells expressing EGFRvIII on their surface. The scFvs recognizing the mutated EGFRvIII protein must be rigorously tested to confirm that they do not also bind to normal, non-mutated EGFR proteins, which are widely expressed on cells in the human body. The researchers then generated a panel of humanized scFvs and tested their specificity and function in CAR modified T cells. (Humanized scFvs are molecularly changed from their origins in non-human species to increase their similarity to human antibodies.) Out of the panel of humanized scFvs that were tested, the researchers selected one scFv to explore further based on its binding selectivity for EGFRvIII over normal non-mutated EGFR. They also evaluated the EGFRvIII CAR T cells in an assay utilizing normal EGFR-expressing skin cells in mice grafted with human skin. They found that the engineered EGFRvIII CAR T cells did not attack cells with normal EGFR in this model. The lead scFv was then tested for its anti-cancer efficacy. Using human tumor cells, the scientific team determined that the EGFRvIII CAR T cells could multiply and secrete cytokines in response to tumor cells bearing the EGFRvIII protein. Importantly, the researchers found that the EGFRvIII CAR T cells controlled tumor growth in several mouse models of glioblastoma, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and luminescence of tumors in the mouse brains. In the mouse model, the EGFRvIII CAR T cells caused tumor shrinkage when measured by MRI and were also effective in eliminating tumors when administered in combination with temozolomide chemotherapy that is used to treat patients with glioblastoma. On the basis of these preclinical results, the investigators designed a phase 1 clinical study of CAR T cells transduced with humanized scFv directed to EGFRvIII for both newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma patients carrying the EGFRvIII mutation. ""There are unique aspects about the immune system that we're now able to utilize to study a completely new type of therapy,"" said O'Rourke. The investigational approach begins when some of each patient's T cells are removed via an apheresis process similar to dialysis, the cells are engineered using a viral vector that programs them to find cancer cells that express EGFRvIII. Then, the patient's own engineered cells are infused back into their body, where a signaling domain built into the CAR promotes proliferation of these ""hunter"" T-cells. In contrast to certain T cell therapies that also target some healthy cells, EGFRvIII is believed to be found only on tumor tissue, which the study's leaders hope will minimize side effects. The new trial will enroll 12 adult patients whose tumors express EGFRvIII, in two groups: One arm of 6 patients whose cancers have returned after receiving other therapies, and one arm of 6 patients who are newly diagnosed with the disease and still have 1 cm or more of tumor tissue remaining after undergoing surgery to remove it.

Every function, feeling or action depends on the ability of synapses to maintain constant communication between neurons, transmitting information via continuous release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles. A new study has discovered that a key factor in regulating this continual communication is the proximity of synaptic vesicles (SVs) next to voltage gated calcium channels within synapses. While synapses contain hundreds to thousands of synaptic vesicles, when a specific signal is received by the neuron, only a fraction of synaptic vesicles that exist in what is called the readily releasable pool are discharged from one neuron to another. Previous studies have demonstrated that within the readily releasable pool, synaptic vesicles have different specific kinetic properties of release that impact the type and bandwidth of information that can be relayed in response to stimulation. What was not known was the cellular mechanisms that regulate the release of synaptic vesicles from the readily releasable pool to support the early stages of auditory processing. Published in the February edition of the Journal of Neuroscience, the authors of the manuscript report that a dominant factor regulating the properties of synaptic vesicle release supporting the early stages of auditory processing is the distance between the synaptic vesicles and voltage gated calcium channels within a synapse. The authors characterized the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles at the calyx of Held, a critical component of auditory processing, employing several different techniques that allowed them to investigate the pre-synaptic mechanisms of informational transmittal. This study identifies the critical mechanism is the regulation of Ca2+ influx through voltage gated calcium channels and release of neurotransmitters by synaptic vesicles. These findings are important for understanding the mechanisms of synaptic transmission, specifically for neuronal circuits that rely on fast, continuous synaptic transmission.  It is becoming apparent that the underlying cause of most neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative diseases is a dysfunction of the synapse,  explained Dr. Young.  Identifying what factors are involved in proper synaptic transmission and neural circuit function have tremendous potential as therapies for neurological disorders or brain injury.  According to Dr. Young, the future goals of this project are to uncover molecular mechanisms that allow synapses to sustain synaptic transmission over a wide range of activity levels to allow for proper information processing by the neuronal circuit in which they are embedded.

Lead author Tamas Horvath and his colleagues set out to monitor the brain circuitry that promotes eating by selectively manipulating the cellular pathway that mediates marijuana's action on the brain, using transgenic mice. ""By observing how the appetite center of the brain responds to marijuana, we were able to see what drives the hunger brought about by cannabis and how that same mechanism that normally turns off feeding becomes a driver of eating,"" said Horvath, the Jean and David W. Wallace Professor of Neurobiology and of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, director of the Yale Program in Cell Signaling and Neurobiology of Metabolism, and chair of the Section of Comparative Medicine. ""It's like pressing a car's brakes and accelerating instead,"" he said. ""We were surprised to find that the neurons we thought were responsible for shutting down eating, were suddenly being activated and promoting hunger, even when you are full. It fools the brain's central feeding system."" In addition to helping explain why you become extremely hungry when you shouldn't be, Horvath said, the new findings could provide other benefits, like helping cancer patients who often lose their appetite during treatment. Researchers have long known that using cannabis is associated with increased appetite even when you are full. It is also well known that activating the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) can contribute to overeating. A group of nerve cells called pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are considered as key drivers of reducing eating when full. ""This event is key to cannabinoid-receptor-driven eating,"" said Horvath, who points out that the feeding behavior driven by these neurons is just one mode of action that involves CB1R signaling. ""More research is needed to validate the findings."" Whether this primitive mechanism is also key to getting ""high"" on cannabis is another question the Horvath lab is aiming to address.

It is an extreme example of what neuroscientists term ""mental time travel"" -- the recollection of memories so rich in detail regarding the time and place of an original experience that it is much like traveling through time. In a paper published in the Journal of Neuroscience, a team of Vanderbilt University scientists shed new light on how the brain processes these elaborate memories by analyzing the brain activity of individuals performing a simple memory recollection task. The researchers found that they can use the activity patterns in a specific region of the brain to substantially improve their ability to predict the order in which the participants recall information that they have recently studied. ""It's extremely important that we understand what different brain regions are doing as we search through our memories,"" said Assistant Professor of Psychology Sean Polyn who headed the study. ""Diseases like Alzheimer's and epilepsy are devastating to memory, and this information can help us develop treatments to preserve patients' memories, and identify adverse effects that new psychotropic drugs may have on people's memory."" Scientists have known for some time that a portion of the brain called the medial temporal lobe (MTL) plays a central role in memory because injuries to the MTL cause amnesia and other memory-related problems. However, they have not been able to answer the question: How does the brain control the fidelity of an individual memory? Of course, not all memories are recalled equally. High fidelity Proustian memories are at one end of the spectrum. At the other are bits of information that a person remembers clearly, but in complete isolation, without any accompanying details. Polyn, working with doctoral students James Kragel and Neal Morton (who is now at the University of Texas, Austin), has developed a model that accounts for how the structures in the MTL support memory retrieval. They have found that the anterior region of the MTL signals that a memory is being retrieved, but doesn't indicate how detailed it is. However, when the posterior region of the MTL becomes active it indicates that the person is experiencing a ""time travel"" memory accompanied by considerable detail. The researchers tested their model in an experiment with 20 participants (seven male and 13 female) between 18 and 35 years of age. They were put in an fMRI brain scanner and given a list of 24 names of common objects like horse, boat and window. Depending on the object they were asked to decide if it was big or small, animate or inanimate. (The purpose of the question was to make them concentrate on the words). After a brief pause, they were asked to recall the words they had just studied in the order they occurred naturally. The researchers found that when a participant's brain scan indicated that they recalled an object with high fidelity, then their next response was likely to be the next item on the list. However, when the brain scan indicated that the object was an isolated recollection, then the next object the person recalled could come from anywhere on the list. For example, the participants might be asked to study the words ""horse, window, robot and boat,"" in that order. An individual who experienced a time-travel experience when he or she recalled the word ""horse,"" would be very likely to recall ""window"" immediately afterward. If, on the other hand, the person's memory of ""horse"" was low fidelity, his or her next response might instead be the more distant word, ""boat."" Polyn's group had previously developed a model of memory search that could be used to predict the order in which people would retrieve these items from memory. For example, the model predicts that people will tend to first recall the items from the end of the list, and if an item from the middle of the list is recalled, the next recollection is likely to come from a nearby list position. ""This model was much better than chance at predicting what a person would recall next, but when we told the model what a person's brain activity was at the moment they recalled a particular item, the model became much better at predicting which item would be recalled next,"" Polyn said. ""This demonstrates that the brain stamps memories with a temporal code. These time-travel recollections allow the brain to retrieve that temporal code, which makes memories for nearby things more accessible, in this case the next item in the list."" The temporal code acts something like the time stamp that computers put on files. When you search for files stamped with a specific date and time, you retrieve all the files saved at the time you specify. Time-travel memory acts in much the same way, through a process psychologists call ""reinstatement."" This process is even more flexible than a computer, in that the temporal code can help you retrieve not just memories from the exact same time, but memories nearby in time, as well. When a strong memory is formed, it may include information about the sights, sounds, smells, emotions, and other information that was present at the time of the experience. All of this information becomes temporally linked, and time-travel memory allows a person to bring it back to mind, as when Proust smelled his famous madeleine cake.

The adulteration of cumin with both peanut and almond has been reported as widespread in the USA and Canada where testing has uncovered high levels of allergenic protein. To protect the brands of suppliers and processors, and to crucially protect allergic consumers, testing is a viable option. With horse-gate still firmly in memory from 2012, this most recent recall serves to confirm the ongoing importance of ingredient and end product testing and a thorough food safety testing plan. Compliance with Labelling Legislation  Both food allergic consumers and food producers rely on the accurate labelling of food products to protect themselves from the consequences of the accidental ingestion of food allergens,  says Steve Chambers, Neogen Europe s Sales and Marketing Director.  With potential adulteration it s important for producers to have the tools to help them label with confidence. Through the use of our validated testing kits, our accredited laboratory services and the experience of our technical staff, we have been working alongside the market to reduce uncertainty.  With our tests, we have ruled out cross-reactivity as a reason for positive peanut results with spice blends and cumin, which is an obvious concern for the food industry. We are confident that our tests are giving a true detection of peanut and almond from testing we have carried out. Accurate and timely testing can protect businesses in the food value chain   and their consumers.  Range of Testing Solutions Neogen s AOAC-approved Veratox  ELISA test for Peanut Allergen has been validated to detect and fully quantify peanut residues in cumin in around 30 minutes, perfect for both laboratories and large food manufacturers.

Reporting in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute online Feb. 11, researchers say that pinpointing these so-called  microRNAs    known as miR-382 and miR-516b   could provide the basis for future medical tests that identify those melanoma most likely to spread and kill. In fact, the NYU Langone team that led this study has already begun a follow-up clinical study to see if any microRNAs have a similar prognostic value in identifying melanoma patients whose cancer is more likely to spread to the brain. Nearly half of people who die from melanoma succumb from its spread to the brain, they note. MicroRNAs are epigenetic factors, chemical cousins of DNA that help regulate gene function.  But unlike other kinds of RNA, microRNAs do not get translated into specific proteins. Detection of the suppressor microRNAs emerged from the analysis of more than 800 of them found in tumor tissue samples from 92 men and women with melanoma. Some 48 of the patients had aggressive cancer, while the rest did not. Tumor tissue samples were provided by patients who agreed to donate their specimens to a research database maintained at NYU Langone.  Our study results show the suppressive effects of two specific microRNAs in melanoma that are less active in aggressive, primary tumors,  says cell biologist and senior study investigator Eva Hernando, PhD.  Going forward, our goal is to show how we can use this information to identify patients more at risk of aggressive disease, and see whether early, more intense therapy improves survival from melanoma,  says Dr. Hernando, an associate professor at NYU Langone and its Perlmutter Cancer Center. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2015, some 73,870 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the United States, resulting in close to 9,940 deaths. According to oncologist and study co-investigator, Iman Osman, MD, a professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Langone and an associate director of the Perlmutter Cancer Center,  Now that we know that the fate of these melanoma tumors is set and predetermined by these microRNAs, we can investigate whether the same principle applies in other tumors and what interventions are possible to prevent or stall their predestined spread.  As part of the study, researchers focused their analysis on 40 microRNAs found active or inactive in early-stage tumors, which had also grown deeper than 2 millimeters and were, as a result, already known most likely to spread. Further experiments were designed to show which, if any, of the microRNAs hindered or helped cancer spread among cells grown in the lab. This helped narrow the search to just a few microRNAs. When the scientific team compared their microRNA results to active or inactive microRNAs in an additional set of tissue samples from 119 people with early-stage melanoma, only the two microRNAs stood out as less abundant in localized cancers that did not spread. Moreover, the researchers report, injections in mice of human melanoma cells programmed to over-activate either miR-382 or miR-516b successfully blocked cancer spread, while injections of melanoma cells with no changed microRNA activity produced significant cancer spread. Funding support for the study was provided by the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, and grants R01 CA155234, T32 CA009161-37, P30 CA016087-30, P30 CA016087-32, C026719, and the Marc Jacobs campaign to support melanoma research.

The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center is one of the world s most respected centres devoted exclusively to cancer patient care, research, education and prevention. MD Anderson was created in 1941 as part of The University of Texas System. United States News & World Report s  Best Hospitals  survey has ranked MD Anderson as one of the nation s top two cancer centres every year since the survey began in 1990. MD Anderson s Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy is the largest programme in the world expediting the development of new cancer drugs. The research collaboration is being led by Drs. Mien-Chie Hung, Vice President for Basic Research, and Chairman of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Scott Kopetz, Associate Professor, GI Medical Oncology and Shulin Li, Professor, Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. MD Anderson will recruit 50 metastatic colorectal cancer patients for the patient study, which is expected to report by the end of the year. Blood will be collected from each patient and processed using ANGLE s Parsortix system. The harvested circulating tumour cells (CTCs) will be distributed to three different MD Anderson labs in pursuit of three key objectives:   Investigation of key markers on the CTCs, which may act as a companion diagnostic to indicate which patients will benefit from the Merck Serono s FDA approved drug Erbitux (Cetuximab). A successful outcome may lead to the use of a Parsortix blood test to help guide the treatment regime to be offered to colorectal cancer patients.  Investigating the number of CTCs that have been through the EMT (epithelial mesenchymal transition) phase and are involved in the process of metastasis. Such mesenchymal CTCs cannot be effectively detected by antibody systems and the capability of the Parsortix system to harvest these CTCs for analysis may yield important clinical information on the process of metastasis leading to secondary cancers.  Investigation of the potential to develop the capability to culture colorectal cancer CTCs harvested by the Parsortix system to provide a population of the patient s cancer cells outside the patient for investigation, for example for chemosensitivity testing. ANGLE is strongly focused on establishing the use of the Parsortix system in clinical practice. To achieve this, a top priority is the establishment of collaborations with key opinion leaders at world class translational research centres. These key opinion leaders are working to identify clinical applications with medical utility (clear benefit to patients), and to obtain clinical data that demonstrates that utility in patient studies. ANGLE believes this is the optimal approach for unlocking the multi-billion dollar worldwide market available to the Company and its potential strategic partners. The first such translational research patient study in ovarian cancer was completed by Medical University of Vienna in January 2015 and reported  unprecedented sensitivity and specificity . This is now being developed as a clinical application for ovarian cancer. ANGLE Founder and Chief Executive, Andrew Newland, commented:  We are delighted to be working with MD Anderson and Drs.

Now, scientists at the University of California (UC) Berkeley and Johns Hopkins University in Maryland are challenging this long-held assumption with new evidence that Broca's area actually switches off when we talk out loud. The findings, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, provide a more complex picture than previously thought of the frontal brain regions involved in speech production. The discovery has major implications for the diagnoses and treatments of stroke, epilepsy and brain injuries that result in language impairments. ""Every year millions of people suffer from stroke, some of which can lead to severe impairments in perceiving and producing language when critical brain areas are damaged,"" said study lead author Adeen Flinker, a postdoctoral researcher at New York University who conducted the study as a UC Berkeley Ph.D. student. ""Our results could help us advance language mapping during neurosurgery as well as the assessment of language impairments."" Flinker said that neuroscientists traditionally organized the brain's language center into two main regions: one for perceiving speech and one for producing speech. ""That belief drives how we map out language during neurosurgery and classify language impairments,"" he said. ""This new finding helps us move towards a less dichotomous view where Broca's area is not a center for speech production, but rather a critical area for integrating and coordinating information across other brain regions."" In the 1860s, French physician Pierre Paul Broca pinpointed this prefrontal brain region as the seat of speech. Broca's area has since ranked among the brain's most closely examined language regions in cognitive psychology. People with Broca's aphasia are characterized as having suffered damage to the brain's frontal lobe and tend to speak in short, stilted phrases that often omit short connecting words such as ""the"" and ""and."" Specifically, Flinker and fellow researchers have found that Broca's area -- located in the frontal cortex above and behind the left eye -- engages with the brain's temporal cortex, which organizes sensory input, and later the motor cortex, as we process language and plan which sounds and movements of the mouth to use, and in what order. However, the study found, it disengages when we actually start to utter word sequences. ""Broca's area shuts down during the actual delivery of speech, but it may remain active during conversation as part of planning future words and full sentences,"" Flinker said. The study tracked electrical signals emitted from the brains of seven hospitalized epilepsy patients as they repeated spoken and written words aloud. Researchers followed that brain activity -- using event-related causality technology -- from the auditory cortex, where the patients processed the words they heard, to Broca's area, where they prepared to articulate the words to repeat, to the motor cortex, where they finally spoke the words out loud.

The Monash University led study, published in Current Biology, sheds new light on the relationship between vision loss and brain plasticity -- the extraordinary ability of the brain to modify its own structure and function as a result of change or damage. Focusing on the visual system, the study details how visual information can be rerouted in the brain to bypass damaged areas. Vision is the most complex sense, with over 50 per cent of the cortex devoted to it. It was thought that one specific pathway from the eye to the brain was responsible for conscious vision, and in the absence of this pathway an individual was rendered blind. However, the research led by Associate Professor James Bourne from the Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute (ARMI) at Monash University, reveals the importance of a second pathway through the pulvinar area of the brain. Researchers discovered the pulvinar plays not only an important role in brain development but also following an injury to the primary pathway, especially in the first year of life. Previous studies demonstrated that children who receive an injury to the primary pathway often retain normal visual capacity, whereas an adult with an identical lesion is left blind. Researchers say developing a greater understanding of the mechanisms for rerouting visual information and the potential of brain plasticity provides great possibilities for regenerative medicine, especially brain injuries caused by stroke and trauma. Associate Professor Bourne said the study provides vital new information on how the visual system is wired together in the brain following an injury. ""Decades of research have focused on one pathway in the brain thought to be responsible for conscious vision. We knew the brain has the capacity to re-wire itself following injury or trauma but the idea that there is a second pathway providing visual information to the brain is a relatively new phenomenon,"" Associate Professor Bourne said. ""Our research proves a second pathway exists but significantly it also shows the brain is much more plastic than originally believed."" The research team established novel techniques that haven't been used in combination before, to profile the specific changes over a period of time. This included novel MRI techniques, which made it possible to map connections and see how they shrunk or grew after an injury. This also allowed the research team to zoom in to the cellular level and identify special characteristics of these cells including how it is possible for them to be able to transmit visual information. Monash PhD student, Ms Claire Warner, who also took part in the study, said identifying the existence of this second pathway was the foundation for future research in this field. ""The next step is to undertake more work to better understand the complex circuitry of the visual brain and how pathways are established in early life and removed at a later stage,"" Ms Warner said. ""We're a long way off but this opens up a whole new line of inquiry to see if we can develop regenerative techniques to restore vision loss."" Monash University   press release Claire E.

In a study published in Anesthesiology, the official medical journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), researchers identified a compound that appears to play a role in the development of opioid tolerance. It may be possible to lessen the development of opioid tolerance if that compound is neutralized or blocked in patients taking opioids chronically for severe pain. ""Opioid tolerance is a growing problem among chronic pain patients and cancer patients in particular,"" said Chih-Peng Lin, M.D., assistant professor, Department of Anesthesiology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine. ""We found that CXCL1, a protein produced by spinal cord tissue, contributes to opioid tolerance. By neutralizing CXCL1 in patients, we might help solve the problem of opioid tolerance."" While there has been extensive research on animals and opioid tolerance, this was the first study to examine both human patients and rats. The researchers compared patients with cancer-related pain controlled by strong opioids such as morphine with age-matched control subjects without cancer who were not taking opioids. They found that in both cancer patients and rats, subjects regularly given opioids and deemed opioid tolerant had an increased concentration of CXCL1 compared to those not regularly administered opioids. The rats were given additional CXCL1 in the space surrounding the spinal cord, which increased the rate of onset and severity of tolerance, providing further evidence that the protein contributes to tolerance. In a second phase of the study, the rats were administered a CXCL1 neutralizing or blocking agent that at least partially maintained the effectiveness of the opioid. ""Opioids are a mainstay of treatment for severe pain, especially cancer pain,"" said Dr. Lin. ""By suppressing opioid tolerance, we can help patients achieve prolonged pain relief without the side effects of increased opioid dosages."" The study authors acknowledged that further research must be done to determine whether blocking CXCL1 will serve as a safe and effective way to eliminate tolerance of certain opioids in patients.

Until now, the underlying mechanisms for these negative symptoms have not been well characterized. In the current edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences a German-American team of researchers reports that a selective dopamine midbrain population that is crucial for emotional and cognitive processing shows reduced electrical in vivo activity in a disease mouse model. Schizophrenia is a severe and incurable psychiatric illness, which affects approximately one percent of the world population. While acute psychotic states of the disease have been successfully treated with psychopharmaceutical drugs (antipsychotic agents) for many decades, cognitive deficits and impairments of motivation do not respond well to standard drug therapy. This is a crucial problem, as the long-term prognosis of a patient is determined above all by the severity of these negative symptoms. Therefore, the shortened average life-span of about 25 years for schizophrenia patients remained largely unaltered in recent decades.  ""In order to develop new therapy strategies we need an improved neurobiological understanding of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia"" explains Prof. Roeper of the Institute for Neurophysiology of the Goethe University. His American colleagues, Prof. Eleanor Simpson and Prof. Eric Kandel at Columbia University in New York recently made an important initial step in this direction. They created a new transgenic mouse model based on striatal overexpression of dopamine typ 2 receptors, which displayed typical signs of cognitive and emotional negative symptoms similar to those occurring in patients with schizophrenia. The researchers detected typical impairment in working memory with corresponding neurochemical changes in dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. However, the underlying neurophysiological impairments of dopamine neurons remained unresolved. Now, Prof. Eleanor Simpson and Prof. Jochen Roeper, in cooperation with the mathematician Prof. Gaby Schneider of the Goethe University and the physiologist Prof. Birgit Liss of the University of Ulm have succeeded in defining the neurophysiological impairments with the dopamine system. They were able to show, with single cell recordings in the intact brain of mice, that those dopamine midbrain neurons responsible for emotional and cognitive processing displayed altered patterns and frequencies of electrical activity. In contrast, adjacent dopamine neurons, which are involved in motor control, were not affected. The researchers were also able to show that   in line with the persistence of cognitive deficits in mice and patients  the pathological discharge patterns of dopamine neurons persisted even after the causal transgene had been switched off in adult mice. ""This result emphasizes the presence of a critical early phase for the development of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia"" according to Roeper. He and his colleagues are currently examining how the neuronal activity of dopamine neurons changes during the working memory tasks. ""Our results show that altered neuronal activity of selective dopamine neurons is crucial for schizophrenia"", Jochen Roeper summarizes the importance of the research work.

The authors of the paper, published by the journal Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews, combed existing research for evidence to support the theory that has dominated nearly 50 years of depression research: that depression is related to low levels of serotonin in the gaps between cells in the brain. The low-serotonin theory is the basis for commonly prescribed serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) anti-depressant medications which keep the neurotransmitter's levels high by blocking its re-absorption into the cells that release it. Those serotonin-boosting medications actually make it harder for patients to recover, especially in the short term, says lead author Paul Andrews, an assistant professor of Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. ""It's time we rethink what we are doing,"" Andrews says. ""We are taking people who are suffering from the most common forms of depression, and instead of helping them, it appears we are putting an obstacle in their path to recovery."" When depressed patients on SSRI medication do show improvement, it appears that their brains are actually overcoming the effects of anti-depressant medications, rather than being assisted directly by them. Instead of helping, the medications appear to be interfering with the brain's own mechanisms of recovery. ""We've seen that people report feeling worse, not better, for their first two weeks on anti-depressants,"" Andrews says. ""This could explain why."" It is currently impossible to measure exactly how the brain is releasing and using serotonin, the researchers write, because there is no safe way to measure it in a living human brain. Instead, scientists must rely on measuring evidence about levels of serotonin that the brain has already metabolized, and by extrapolating from studies using animals. The best available evidence appears to show that there is more serotonin being released and used during depressive episodes, not less, the authors say. The paper suggests that serotonin helps the brain adapt to depression by re-allocating its resources, giving more to conscious thought and less to areas such as growth, development, reproduction, immune function, and the stress response. Andrews, an evolutionary psychologist, has argued in previous research that anti-depressants leave patients in worse shape after they stop using them, and that most forms of depression, though painful, are natural and beneficial adaptations to stress.

Researchers found that these genes have an effect on a protein called AMPK, offering valuable insight that could help identify patients who are most likely to respond to AMPK-directed chemotherapies. This is an especially exciting development because there are already FDA-approved drugs, such as metformin, which activate AMPK and are being tested in clinical trials for cancer,  said senior author Dr. Ryan Potts, Assistant Professor of Physiology, Biochemistry, and Pharmacology, and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.  Our study provides a new biomarker, MAGE-A3/6, which can help identify patients who are likely to respond to these treatments.  The findings are published online in the journal Cell. The MAGE-A3/6 genes are found on the X chromosome in both men and women. Normally, the function of MAGE-A3/6 is restricted to the production of sperm in men. However, in some situations the genes are abnormally switched on and Dr. Potts and his team discovered that when this happens, normal cells are turned into cancerous cells. We found that the normally testis-restricted MAGE-A3/6 genes are aberrantly expressed in many cancers, including breast, lung, and colon cancers where they promote tumor growth.  Importantly, the expression of these genes is associated with decreased survival for cancer patients. Therefore, these genes are ideal cancer-specific chemotherapy targets,  said Dr. Potts, the Michael L. Rosenberg Scholar in Medical Research.Following further investigation on how MAGE-A3/6 functions to promote cancer, Dr. Potts and his team discovered that the protein   called AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)   is inhibited by MAGE-A3/6. AMPK can detect cellular energy levels and controls energy usage in cells. If low energy levels are detected, AMPK switches off energy-consuming pathways (protein and lipid synthesis) and turns on pathways to acquire more energy (cellular breakdown). Additionally, these activities of AMPK can play a role in suppressing the growth of cancerous tumors. The study used various molecular biological techniques in mouse and human tissues to investigate the mechanisms of interaction between MAGE-A3/6, another protein called TRIM28 and AMPK, and found that MAGE-A3/6 degrades AMPK by working with TRIM28, removing the tumor-suppressive properties and resulting in transformation of normal cells and tumor growth.Dr. Potts  lab focuses on understanding the basic molecular, genetic, and cellular events that give rise to cancer. His lab initially defined a novel family of cancer cell-specific proteins, called MAGE proteins, which promote tumor growth, and is now focused on elucidating the biochemical, cellular, and physiological function of individual MAGE proteins.Dr. Potts was awarded the Sara and Frank McKnight independent postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Biochemistry at UT Southwestern, was named an Endowed Scholar in Biomedical Research in the Department of Physiology at UT Southwestern, and received a Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) Scholar in Cancer Research Award.

It requires minimal or no training and makes anthrax testing safer, easier, faster and cheaper. The annual Award for Excellence recognizes employees of FLC member laboratories and non-laboratory staff who have accomplished outstanding work in transferring federally developed technology. A panel of experts from industry, state and local government, academia and the federal laboratory system judge the nominations. A Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project in Sandia s International Biological Threat Reduction Program led to BaDx. While a large team helped develop the detector, the FLC award recognizes scientists Thayne Edwards, Melissa Finley and Jason Harper. The technology was licensed to Aquila, a New Mexico woman-owned small business that specializes in the design and manufacture of technologies and services for nuclear security and international safeguards.  It has been a remarkable experience to not only work with a Sandia research team in developing cool technology, but also with dedicated business partners to transfer that technology to,  Edwards said.  The awards that have recognized these efforts are another reminder to me of the great people I get to work with and the reward of solving difficult problems together.  Jackie Kerby Moore, Sandia s manager of Technology and Economic Development and the labs  representative to the FLC, said the competition for this year s award was especially tough.  Sandia s BaDx technology transfer recognition was one of only three selected across all of the Department of Energy laboratories for successful technology development and deployment,  she says.  It is very satisfying to be recognized by our peers.  A deadly bacteria Bacillus anthracis, the anthrax bacteria, is found in soils worldwide and can cause serious, often fatal, illness in humans and animals. It can survive in harsh conditions for decades. Humans can be exposed through skin contact, inhalation of spores or eating contaminated meat. Currently, samples for testing must be propagated in a laboratory that uses specialized tools requiring a consistent power supply, something often unavailable in the developing world, said Finley, who helps veterinary labs in less-developed countries improve safety, security and efficiency at diagnosing infectious diseases.  Working with dangerous samples like B. anthracis spores places laboratory staff at risk,  she said.  Concentrating many positive test samples in a lab could also tempt someone to steal positive anthrax samples for nefarious uses.  Another barrier is cost.  Farmers in many developing countries don t make a lot of money, so they don t pay for diagnostic testing often,  Finley said.  When they do, they can t afford to pay a lot for it.  The most common diagnostic test for anthrax costs around $30, which is out of the reach of many farmers, perhaps discouraging them from testing animals they suspect are infected, Finley said. The new device, which is like a pocket-sized laboratory, could cost around $5-$7 and does not require specialized tools. Complex and sensitive, but simple to operate BaDx needs no battery or electric power or special laboratory equipment. It s hardy against wide temperature variation and can detect very small numbers of B. anthracis spores. A field technician puts a sample swab into the amplification chamber, which contains selective growth media. The device then uses a lateral flow assay, similar to a common pregnancy test, to detect B. anthracis. Magnetically operated valves allow the sample to advance from stage to stage to complete the testing process. A colored line appears on the device several hours later, if the test is positive for the bacteria. The technician can then initiate a chemical process that sterilizes the device, avoiding the risk of positive samples accumulating and falling into the wrong hands.  The device amplifies the B. anthracis so it can detect as few as 100 spores instead of the typical 1-10 million required for detection,  Harper said. Harper and Edwards developed the microfluidics platform with the patent-pending magnetic valves that move the sample through the testing process. Bioscientist Bryan Carson, with technologists Jackie Murton and Bryce Ricken, developed the selective media, worked on building and testing the device and helped develop the decontamination strategy. Nanotechnology researchers George Bachand and Amanda Carroll-Portillo are working on improved strips for the lateral flow assay. Bill Arndt, a researcher in Sandia s International Biological Threat Reduction Program who regularly works in the developing world, provided guidance on device design. Their work builds on Sandia s long-standing expertise in bioforensics, most visible in the work the Labs did in response to the anthrax spores mailed to media offices and two U.S. senators in the fall of 2001, killing five.  This is a wonderful example of where very sophisticated technology has enabled a practical solution to a very important problem  said Pete Atherton, senior manager of Industry Partnerships at Sandia.  Aquila has been a great partner for several years and their commercializing of this technology will help us fulfill our mission of serving the public good.  The FLC is a nationwide network of about 300 members that provides a forum to develop strategies and opportunities for linking laboratory mission technologies and expertise with the marketplace. The FLC Awards Program annually recognizes federal laboratories and their industry partners for outstanding technology transfer efforts and has become one of the most prestigious honors in technology transfer. Since it was established in 1984, the FLC has presented awards to more than 200 federal laboratories.","Published: February 17, 2015"

The new study, published recently in the journal Brain, revealed the mechanism of toxicity of a misfolded form of the protein that underlies prion diseases, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( mad cow disease ) and its human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.  Our study reveals a novel mechanism of neuronal death involved in a neurodegenerative protein-misfolding disease,  said Corinne Lasm zas, a TSRI professor who led the study.  Importantly, the death of these cells is preventable. In our study, ailing neurons in culture and in an animal model were completely rescued by treatment, despite the continued presence of the toxic misfolded protein. This work suggests treatment strategies for prion diseases and possibly other protein misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer s.  Failure and Rescue of Brain Cells In the new study, the scientists used a misfolded form of the prion disease protein, called TPrP, a model they had previously developed, to study misfolded protein-induced neurodegeneration in the laboratory. Misfolded proteins are the common cause of the group of diseases comprising prion, Alzheimer s, Parkinson s diseases, ALS and other conditions. Using biochemical techniques, the researchers demonstrated that TPrP induces neuronal death by profoundly depleting NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) a metabolite well known as a coenzyme that is common to all cells and necessary for energy production and cellular homeostasis. Restoring NAD+ proved to be the critical factor for the rescue of neurons subjected to TPrP injury. Even when added three days after TPrP exposure, an infusion of NAD+ reversed within only a few hours the fate of neurons that had been doomed to destruction.  Our study shows for the first time that a failure of NAD+ metabolism is the cause of neuronal loss following exposure to a misfolded protein,  Lasm zas said. The loss of NAD+ also triggers autophagy a way cells rid themselves of damaged material such as misfolded proteins and apoptosis, or programmed cell death, the last resort of the cell when everything starts to go wrong. However, the researchers demonstrated these mechanisms do not initiate the neuronal demise.  We show that apoptosis or programmed cell death and autophagy are not primary players in the death cascade,  said Staff Scientist Minghai Zhou, the first author of the study.  Modulation of neither of these processes significantly alters the death of TPrP-exposed neurons. This is all caused by NAD+ disappearing the cell cannot survive without it.  Lasm zas noted the loss of NAD+ is suggestive of some other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson s where NAD+ depletion could play a role in mitochondrial failure. New Grant to Support Further Research A recent $1.4-million grant from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) will support further work to look for drug candidates based on the new findings. Lasm zas and Louis Scampavia, a TSRI associate professor of molecular therapeutics, will be co-principal investigators for the new three-year study, whose team will also include Tom Bannister, a TSRI associate scientific director at Scripps Florida s Translational Research Institute. The scientists have developed several primary tests for compounds that could restore NAD+ and plan to begin those tests at Scripps Florida s High Throughput Screening facility. Since it was established in 2005, the Scripps Florida High Throughput Screening facility has screened more than 200 targets in more than 235 industrial and academic collaborations several of these collaborations have produced successful clinical trial candidates. The drug discovery facility is currently capable of routinely screens one quarter of a million compounds in a single day.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-therapeutic-strategy-discovered-for-ovarian-cancer-203061,New Therapeutic Strategy Discovered for Ovarian Cancer New therapeutic target could lead to the first effected targeted therapy for aggressive forms of ovarian cancer   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Ovarian cancer is the deadliest of all cancers affecting the female reproductive system with very few effective treatments available.  Prognosis is even worse among patients with certain subtypes of the disease. Now, researchers at The Wistar Institute have identified a new therapeutic target in a particularly aggressive form of ovarian cancer, paving the way for what could be the first effective targeted therapy of its kind for the disease. The findings were published online by the journal Nature Medicine. Ovarian cancer is divided into four different histological subtypes. One of the subtypes is ovarian clear cell carcinoma, which affects approximately 5 to 10 percent of American ovarian cancer patients and about 20 percent of patients in Asia. While most patients with ovarian cancer initially respond well to standard-care platinum-based chemotherapy, the response rate among those with the clear cell subtype is typically low and there is currently no effective therapy for these patients.  This underscores the need for a new approach to treating this deadly disease.  One of the significant challenges with the treatment of ovarian cancer is finding a suitable target that effectively halts the progression of the disease in a personalized manner based on one s genetic makeup,  said Rugang Zhang, Ph.D., associate professor in Wistar s Gene Expression and Regulation Program and corresponding author of the study.  With this study, we have done just that. For patients with this particular subtype, this newly discovered targeted approach may eventually lead to the first effective targeted therapy they ve ever had.  The team at Wistar began by looking at ARID1A, a chromatin remodeler. When functioning normally, ARID1A makes it possible for chromatin   a cellular structure that holds DNA together in our cells   to open up and allow our cells to receive commands.  This process dictates our cells  behavior and prevents them from becoming cancerous.  However, recent studies have shown that ARID1A is mutated in more than 50 percent of cases of ovarian clear cell carcinoma.  In fact, ARID1A has one of the highest mutation rates among all types of human cancer.  To date, though, no therapies designed to target this common mutation have been described. What interested the researchers was the relationship between ARID1A and EZH2, an enzyme that promotes compaction of the DNA. When this happens, the result is a loss of expression of genes in the compacted regions, thus preventing the transcription of DNA into tumor-fighting proteins for our body. While present in normal cells to maintain a transcriptional balance, an overabundance of EZH2 has been associated with the progression of different types of cancer, including ovarian clear cell carcinoma.  This prompted the team to explore the utility of EZH2 inhibition as a potential therapeutic means of treating cancer with ARID1A mutation. The interplay between ARID1A and EZH2 was confirmed when the researchers observed that ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancers are sensitive to EZH2 inhibition. Most exciting of all, EZH2 inhibition caused the regression of ovarian tumors with mutated ARID1A, while having minimal effects on the growth of ovarian tumor with normal or unmutated ARID1A in experimental models. Thus, the response to EZH2 inhibition correlates with ARID1A mutational status or the so-called  synthetic lethality.   With EZH2 inhibitors currently in clinical development, we believe that our findings will have far-reaching implications,  said Benjamin Bitler, Ph.D., a member of the Zhang laboratory, an American Cancer Society postdoctoral fellowship recipient, and first author of the study.  Excitingly, this study provides a much-needed therapeutic strategy for clear cell ovarian cancer and can be utilized to aid in the identification of patients that could benefit from EZH2 inhibition therapy.   This study highlights the impact of how team science in our Cancer Center can bring about transformative discoveries,  said Dario C. Altieri, M.D., director of The Wistar Institute Cancer Center and executive vice president and chief scientific officer of The Wistar Institute.  This has been our approach to better understand difficult-to-treat and recalcitrant tumors, like ovarian cancer, and we are thrilled that this groundbreaking research tangibly advances the prospects of better, more targeted therapies for these patients.

However, serendipitously they found that mice lacking this gene died prematurely of sudden cardiac death. More detailed investigations showed that these mice had an irregular conductance in the right side of the heart, a condition known as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). The researchers discovered that iASPP had a previously unknown role in controlling desmosomes   one of the main structures that 'glue' individual heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) together. The genetic defect was shown to weaken desmosome function at the junctions of heart muscle cells: this affected the structural integrity of the heart, making mice lacking iASPP prone to ARVC. Further studies of heart tissue from human patients who had died from ARVC showed that some of them have similar defects in desmosomes as in the mice suggesting that the faulty iASPP gene could also be responsible for ARVC deaths in humans. This finding also explains why a previously reported cattle herd with spontaneous iASPP gene deletion died of sudden cardiac death. A report of the research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 'We set out to investigate how this protein might cause cancer and found by chance that it could play a key role in this rare genetic heart condition,' said Professor Xin Lu, Director of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research at Oxford University, the lead investigator of the report. 'It took my DPhil student Mario Notari, the lead author of the study, over two years of further detective work, in collaboration with our colleagues in Oxford and London, to show how a single faulty gene can affect the function of desmosomes, one of the main structures that 'glue' heart muscle cells together. Our studies suggest that these changes can threaten the structural integrity of the heart and predispose humans and animals to AVRC.' ARVC is uncommon in humans, affecting around 1 in 2000 people in the UK [1], and is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death, which is estimated to kill around 100,000 people a year in the UK [2]. Whilst approximately 50% of human ARVC cases are related to known genetic defects in desmosomes, the cause of the other 50% of cases still remains unknown. The new study suggests that mutations in the gene encoding the iASPP protein may contribute to the development of ARVC in these previously-unexplained cases. Professor Lu said: 'Our hearts are pumping every second of our lives so the heart is an organ that is under constant mechanical strain. If you think of these desmosomes as 'gluey' joints that hold heart cells together any weaknesses or 'cracks' that you introduce into these structures weaken the whole organ. Mice with the faulty gene controlling the protein, or that do not have sufficient amount of the protein to maintain the full function of desmosomes, develop weaknesses in the right ventricle of their hearts at early stages such as embryos. With time, the 'cracks' get bigger and when they reach a certain level it leads to premature death in adults   and these are strikingly similar to the weaknesses we see in the tissues of human ARVC patients.' The team says that further research is needed into iASPP to establish exactly how it controls desmosomal structure and function to maintain heart tissue integrity for proper mechanical and electrical activity. Follow-up research will look into families with a history of ARVC to see if the gene controlling iASPP could be used to diagnose those at risk of developing the condition. If a reliable biomarker could be developed it could help clinicians to advise people to make lifestyle changes that would put them at less risk of sudden cardiac death and enable them to live longer. One of the long-term side effects of cancer therapy is cardiotoxicity, a condition caused by a weakening of the heart function after cancer therapy. It could be that the same genes being targeted to treat cancer may also regulate desmosomes in the heart. So this discovery may also have implications for research into cancer drug discovery programs in order to find ways to minimise cardiotoxicity.","Published: February 17, 2015"

The study found that greater numbers of resistant bacteria exist close to some waste water treatment works, and that these plants are likely to be responsible for at least half of the increase observed. Antimicrobial resistance is one of the largest threats to human health for a century, the researchers argue. Increasingly large amounts of antibiotics are released into the environment through both human and agricultural use, with surface run off from farming activities (including fertiliser and animal slurry) washed straight into rivers after heavy rainfall. Co-lead on the research, Professor Elizabeth Wellington of the University of Warwick, said:  Antibiotic resistance naturally occurs in the environment, but we don t yet know how human and agricultural waste is affecting its development. We ve found that waste water discharges effect resistance levels and that improvements in our treatment processes could hold the key to reducing the prevalence of resistant bacteria in the environment.  We found antibiotic resistance in the group Enterobacteriaceae which includes gut bacteria and pathogens.  Published in Nature s The ISME Journal, the study has also shown that different types of waste water treatment plant release varying amounts of resistant bacteria. Professor Wellington explains: We produced a model based on our data which showed that there was a big difference between secondary and tertiary activated sludge plant where the latter resulted in a predicted 100-fold decrease in resistance levels. Study co-lead author, Dr William Gaze of the University of Exeter Medical School said:  Our research has shed further light on links between environmental pollutants and antibiotic resistance. It has allowed us to uncover an association between a number of compounds - such as zinc, phosphorous and silicon - and antibiotic resistance. We think those bacteria that have developed to survive in environments rich in metals may also possess antibiotic resistance mechanisms   highlighting the complexity of this global issue.  The researchers analysed water and sediment samples from 13 sites across the Thames river catchment and developed detailed models to predict the distribution of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The team also found that several other factors affected the prevalence of antibiotic resistance, such as changes in rainfall and land cover. For example, heavy rainfall at a point surrounded by grassland raised resistance levels; whereas a heavy rainfall at a point surrounded by woodland reduced the levels seen. The findings have allowed the research team to develop a robust model that will predict the level of antibiotic resistance in other catchments, without the need for detailed water sampling. Increased levels of antibiotic resistance in the aquatic environment could lead to increased risk of human exposure. More research is required to fully understand the risk posed via this route and the possible implications for public health.","Published: February 17, 2015"

The novel vaccine would provide a powerful weapon in the fight to rid the world of polio, and this project is being funded by a  438,000 grant from the World Health Organisation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The synthetic vaccine is currently being engineered in collaboration with Prof Dave Stuart at Diamond Light Source and the University of Oxford, and Prof. Dave Rowlands and Dr Nic Stonehouse at the University of Leeds. The project is also supported by the work of Prof Ian Jones at the University of Reading, Drs Andy Macadam and Phil Minor at the National Institute for Biological Standardisation and Control (NIBSC), and Prof George Lonossoff at the John Innes Institute. The team s hope is to create a vaccine that does not contain the viral genome but instead  mimics  the structure of the live virus. Such a vaccine would be quicker, easier and safer to produce. Even after the apparent global elimination of poliomyelitis it will be necessary to continue vaccination as a precaution against reintroduction of the virus from hidden sources, such as rare chronically infected carriers. A synthetic vaccine would fulfil this role without the inherent danger of accidental release of virus associated with the production of current vaccines. Eventually such vaccines could pave the way to completely eliminating the necessity to vaccinate. Speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS 2015) meeting in San Jose on the 13th February 2015, Prof Dave Stuart, Life Sciences Director at Diamond Light Source, the UK s national synchrotron science facility, and Professor of Structural Biology at Oxford University, explains:  Using a combination of techniques, including X-ray crystallography at Diamond and electron cryo-microscopy in Oxford, we ve begun the task of gathering crystal structures and electron microscopy images that will tell us what we need to know to stabilise the shell of the virus and engineer a strong vaccine that has the ability to bring about the desired immune response in humans.   Following on from the success we ve had with the foot and mouth disease vaccine, we aim to transfer the approach to vaccines for other viruses including polio. Early results with polio are very promising, with synthetic particles being produced and evidence of successful stabilisation.  Prof Stuart has devoted his career as a structural biologist to outsmarting viruses to benefit human and animal health. 21st Century technology will, he believes, play a key role in helping us to dramatically improve our response times when new virus outbreaks occur. He adds,  Our basic research capabilities are being greatly enhanced by developments in a number of key areas such as synchrotron light sources, light microscopy and the now fantastically powerful electron microscopy technique.   Using the latest technology, we can engineer vaccines that are billions of times smaller than a pinhead, we can track viruses as they interact with living cells, and we can glean the detailed information required to look at pathogens and then design better therapies against them. At the same time, out in the field, we can have DNA sequencers that can aid gene sequencing and help speed up the process of designing new synthetic vaccines with the added advantage of not having to send deadly virus samples around the world.  Scientists working on the next generation of vaccines and inhibitors to combat viruses and bacterial infections will have their research capabilities greatly enhanced when the UK s new Electron Bio-Imaging Centre (eBIC) opens in late 2015. Conveniently located next to Diamond s synchrotron building, the centre s powerful cryo-electron microscopes will allow scientists to visualise the structure of the cell to help further understand molecular make-up and will provide new tools to image single bio-molecules. The new centre will offer the imaging approaches of single particle analysis of biological macromolecules and cellular tomography, as well as electron crystallography. These techniques will complement the atomic mapping possible with the established macromolecular crystallography beamlines. Additional capabilities coming online in the future are elemental mapping in cells provided by the X-ray nanoprobe and the larger scale cell imaging capability of the new Full Field Cryo Transmission X-ray Microscope (cryo-TXM). These complementary new facilities are expected to draw scientists from around the world, and establish the nation s synchrotron as a hub of world-leading research into disease prevention.","Published: February 16, 2015"

Under the WFD, all member states must improve the condition of their water supplies, drastically reducing the levels of major pollutants by 2015. Targets were introduced on 22 December 2000, with the aim of protecting, enhancing and restoring the condition of all water in the natural environment. Despite these targets, the majority of water bodies in the UK and in other EU countries are failing to meet the required targets. Only 27% of rivers, streams, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters and groundwater in England are currently classified as being of  good status  under the standards set down by the WFD[i]. One of the major barriers is the lack of suitable measurement procedures to allow accurate determination of pollutants at the low levels that the Directive requires. In order to combat this, a feasibility study was launched under the European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP) for the preparation of reference materials for PAHs, PBDEs and TBT in natural waters. PAHs are found in fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, and in tar deposits, and are generally produced when insufficient oxygen or other factors result in incomplete combustion of organic matter. PBDEs can be found in many everyday household items such as upholstered furniture, mattresses and other synthetic home textiles with flame retardants, and TV or computer equipment containing plastic casings, cables and circuit boards. These items often end up in landfill where potentially harmful levels of PBDEs could leach into rivers. TBT was used as a biocide in anti-fouling paint, commonly known as bottom paint, for decades, before being banned when it was discovered that TBT-derived leachates are highly toxic for marine organisms at all points of the food chain, including mammals. LGC scientists contributed to the feasibility study by characterising reference material slurries for fine particulate matter with size below 450 nanometres (nm) and 200 nm. The work was performed with a field-flow fractionation (FFF) instrument coupled to variety of detectors. Panayot Petrov, Science Leader in the Inorganic Analysis team within the Science and Innovation division at LGC said:  A requirement of the WFD is that whole, non-filtered waters have to be analysed. This is because suspended particulate matter (SPM) plays a key role in the transport and fate of organic pollutants in the aquatic environment. We used our expertise in nano-particle measurement to characterise the small particles (<450 nm) present in the samples. This provided necessary information about the nature of the model SPMs used.  Three types of ready-to-use water test materials were successfully developed for PAHs, PBDEs and TBT at nanogram-per litre levels. Combining the humic acids with these model suspended particulate matter (SPM) materials represent a step forward in the production of test materials mimicking whole natural water as stipulated in the European Union Water Framework Directive. The paper,  Novel concepts for preparation of reference materials as whole water samples for priority substances at nanogram-per-liter level using model suspended particulate matter and humic acids , led by JRC-IRMM with LGC s contribution has been published in the December issue of Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry.","Published: February 16, 2015"

In research published today in The American Journal of Epidemiology, investigator Amanda Bakian, Ph.D., an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Utah, and her colleagues outline chemical and meteorological variables that are risk factors for suicide. Their study, titled  Acute air pollution exposure and risk of suicide completion,  examines how those factors play out among different genders and age groups. The findings build on other research by Bakian released in April 2014, when she found that fine particulates and nitrogen dioxide in air pollution are linked with an increased risk for suicide. In the latest study, Bakian and researchers found an increased risk of suicide associated with short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter among Salt Lake City residents who died by suicide between 2000 to 2010. In particular, men and Salt Lake City residents between 36 to 64 years of age experienced the highest risk of suicide following short-term air pollution exposure.  We are not exactly sure why risk of suicide was higher in these two groups but suspect that it might be because these two groups were either exposed to higher levels of air pollution or that other additional factors make these two groups more susceptible to the effects of air pollution,  said Bakian. Bakian examined the records of more than 1,500 people who died by suicide in Salt Lake County between Jan. 1, 2000, and Dec. 31, 2010, and found that the odds of completing suicide were 20 percent higher for people exposed to increased levels of nitrogen dioxide in the two to three days before their deaths. Similarly, individuals exposed to high concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the two to three days before a suicide experienced 5 percent higher odds of suicide. Research found the risk was highest during the spring and fall  not the winter months when inversions are most common. Data from the records also revealed that men experienced a 25 percent increase in the odds of suicide following short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide and a 6 percent increase in the odds of suicide following short-term exposure to fine particulate matter. In addition, the odds of suicide in people between the ages of 36 to 64 increased by 20 percent following short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide and 7 percent following short-term exposure to fine particulate matter.  As suicide risk was found to differ by age and gender, this suggests that vulnerability to suicide following air pollution exposure is not uniform across Salt Lake County residents and that some Salt Lake County residents are more vulnerable than others,  said Bakian.  Our next step is to determine in more detail exactly what elements such as genetic and sociodemographic factors  are responsible for increasing one s vulnerability to suicide following air pollution exposure.  She is careful to point out that the research doesn t state that bad air causes suicide. While the study doesn t prove that air pollution causes someone to commit suicide, it suggests that higher levels of pollution might interact with other factors to increase the risk for suicide, she noted.","Published: February 16, 2015"

It is hoped that the LuCID (Lung Cancer Indicator Detection) programme will lead to a non-invasive method of diagnosing lung cancer in the early stages. The company behind the device, Cambridge-based Owlstone Nanotech Ltd, carried out a health economic analysis and determined that detection of early-stage lung cancer could be increased from the current 14.5% to 25% by 2020, it is estimated this could save 10,000 lives and  250m of NHS money. The device works by measuring volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at low concentrations in a patient s breath and offers a cheaper and smaller alternative to existing detection technologies. Supported by the University of Leicester s enterprise and business development team and Leicester s Hospitals, Owlstone was awarded  1m by the NHS Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) towards the second phase of the LuCID project   the clinical trials. The aim is to further evaluate Owlstone s GC-FAIMS (Gas Chromatography   Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry) sensor in a rapid access lung cancer clinic at Glenfield Hospital, Leicester starting later this year. If successful, the project will pave the way to evaluate the technology in GPs  surgeries and other hospitals. Billy Boyle, co-founder of Owlstone, said:  If you could change only one thing in the fight against cancer, it would be to detect the disease earlier where existing treatments are already proven to save lives. FAIMS technology has the potential to bring a quick and easy-to-use breath test to a GP s office. Our team will not rest until we help stop the daily devastation that cancer brings to patients and their families."" The clinical study is being led by Dr Salman Siddiqui, a clinical senior lecturer and adult chest physician at the University of Leicester and Glenfield Hospital with results of the trial expected in early 2016. The study will be delivered by a number of key members of the lung cancer clinical team including senior lung cancer clinician, Dr Jonathan Bennett. Dr Siddiqui added:  Lung cancer has one of the lowest 5-year survival rates of all cancers, however early diagnosis can greatly improve a patient s prognosis. Current diagnostic procedures such as a chest X-ray, CT scan and bronchoscopy are costly and not without risks so the benefits of a non-invasive, cheaper alternative are clear.  This project will seek to identify and evaluate biomarkers in order to improve the accuracy and reliability of breath diagnostic methods. We will also be aiming to establish FAIMS as a faster, less expensive and more portable alternative to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for breath diagnosis applications.

As part of a wider air pollution mapping project supported by aerial survey company Bluesky, a pollution monitoring system, developed by scientists at the University of Leicester, aims to record how dangerous gases, such as nitrogen dioxide, dissipate with vertical distance from the earth.  The micro sensors will be integrated with other technologies and launched into the atmosphere using Starchaser Industries  Tempest Research Rocket. The launch follows previous work mapping air pollution across entire cities from planes, cars and ground sensors. The Tempest is a 4.1 metre (14 foot) tall rocket that can reach speeds of up to 200 mph and will hit an altitude of  3,000 feet on this flight before being safely recovered via parachute. In addition to the air pollution monitoring sensors Tempest will also be carrying vital electronic systems that will be used aboard Starchaser s future Space Tourism Rockets, an experimental GPS package and video cameras. The Tempest Rocket is expected to be launched on 4th February 2015 at 1030 am from Capesthorne Hall, Cheshire, in front of an audience of hundreds of pupils and teachers from more than 30 schools.  We have already had great success mapping air pollution from an aerial survey plane giving us a better understanding of how dangerous gases, such as nitrogen dioxide, operate in the vertical plane,  commented James Eddy Bluesky s Technical Director and Industrial Associate at the University of Leicester.  However, we hope this launch will take air pollution monitoring to another level.  Dr Roland Leigh, academic supervisor at the University of Leicester added,  Air Quality continues to be a critical issue in our urbanising society, requiring us to explore novel solutions for monitoring, management and damage mitigation. We are grateful to Starchaser Industries for the opportunity to test our novel air quality monitoring techniques as part of this spectacular launch event. This project builds on work to date of Starchaser Industries, key academic expertise in instrument design and data manipulation, and once again benefits from a strong industrial partnership with Bluesky.  The latest phase of the Bluesky supported air pollution monitoring project will add to results already obtained from trials of the University of Leicester s world leading Compact Air Quality Spectrometer. Originally mounted on a dedicated aerial survey aircraft the device monitors visible light and measures how much light is lost at specific wavelengths absorbed by NO2. The technology has previously been used as part the CityScan project with devices mounted on tall buildings in Leicester, Bologna and London during the Olympics to build 3D maps of pollution across the cities.

While changes in protein levels are commonly inferred from measuring changes in mRNA levels (due to the difficulties involved in measuring protein levels), it s not often clear whether determining RNA levels is actually a good proxy for measuring protein levels. In their recent article in the journal Science, Broad Institute researchers working in core member Aviv Regev s and institute member Nir Hacohen s laboratories, along with the Broad s Proteomics Platform led by Steve Carr describe a quantitative genomic model that lets them explain the abundance of proteins in cells based on mRNA expression, translation, and degradation. They performed their study in mouse dendritic cells stimulated with LPS, a component of bacteria. While previous studies had looked at global levels of regulation in rapidly-dividing, unstimulated cells, this work focuses on understanding how much of the change in protein levels is due to a change in mRNA expression, translation, and degradation in specific genes and classes of genes in response to a stimulus - in this case, LPS. For example, would the changes in levels of one class of proteins be mostly driven by changes in the levels of the mRNAs that encode them? On the other hand, would changes in the levels of other groups of proteins occur without changes in mRNA, but rather due to faster translation or slower degradation of the protein? These were the type of questions the scientists were interested in. Explains co-first author Marko Jovanovic,  Can we, in a dynamic system, integrate RNA and protein life cycle data? People rarely do this, and never systematically. Can we really make a global model of gene expression where we know, in the end, how much each type of regulatory layer is contributing to each gene? You can get a global answer too, but straight percentages of global contribution of RNA levels and the protein life cycle to final protein levels was not my goal. My question was really, do we see that certain classes of genes are controlled one way and certain other classes another way and therefore gain new regulatory insight?  Since changes in protein levels are not as dramatic and fast as changes in RNA levels, one of the greatest challenges they faced in their study was distinguishing actual signal from noise. Co-first author Michael Rooney explains how they tackled this problem:  While the quantitative accuracy of mass spectrometry has grown tremendously, we realized that statistical strategies for handling stochastic and systematic errors in the data would still be critical to getting correct results. As a first step, we developed a generative statistical model for the data. This allowed us to leverage the entire time course in a manner that was robust to missing values and stochastic variation. Second, we saw that the contribution of translation might be over-estimated if we allowed translation rates and protein levels to be calculated from the same experimental system, because in such a case they would both be confounded by the same systematic errors, making them appear more similar than they actually are. This led us to the novel strategy of creating biological replicates prepared by distinct peptide library protocols.  In this way, the team was able to robustly build a dynamic model in which the mRNA synthesis rate, the translation rate and the protein degradation rate change over time. Based on this model, it was possible to predict how much of each of the three types of regulation are contributing to the change in the level of each protein and from that measure both globally, per gene class, and per gene, the relative contributions of each type of regulation. Analyzing the LPS-stimulated dendritic cells, the researchers found that overall mRNA expression dominates the regulation strategies, accounting for up to 90% of the fold changes in protein level variation. This is a significant increase from their pre-stimulation measurements showing regulation of mRNA expression contributing 60-70%, translation 15-25%, and degradation also 10-20%. What appeared to be regulated more substantially by the protein lifecycle (translation, degradation) were highly expressed genes. And, looking at changes in the number of protein molecules rather than just the relative fold changes in pre- versus post-stimulated cells, what emerges is that post-stimulation, regulation at the level of the protein lifecycle begins to dominate. The findings lead to a model for the LPS-stimulated system in which protein expression associated with functions critical for a dendritic cell-specific functions is taken care of by regulation at the level of RNA expression. However, the readjustment of the pre-existing proteome when the cells enter a new state (for example, in response to pathogen stimulation) is controlled via regulation of the protein life cycle (translation, degradation) rather than RNA expression.  We termed this the  cupcake model ,  says Jovanovic.  You have to forgive me, this is my European view on how I see people buy cupcakes. They go into the store and choose the cupcake based on the icing, so the icing is kind of the identity of the cupcake. So from one cupcake to another you are basically changing the icing. In our model, the identity of cell states is adjusted by mRNA regulation so mRNA regulation is basically contributing to the icing. However, there s also the cake part. The cake part is often specifically adjusted to the icing on top of the cupcake. The cake part, analogous to  housekeeping genes , also needs to change and this is mainly through the protein life cycle. I m very biased because I don t like the icing on cupcakes, just the cake part, and so in the same vein, I wanted to know more about how the protein lifecycle contributes to gene expression. I think people have focused too much on the icing.   So, mRNA changes drive new cell state identity. Protein lifecycle regulation drives readjustment of preexisting  housekeeping genes  such as those encoding ribosomes and factors involved in metabolism to adjust the cell to its new state. This approach is extensible to test the regulation of gene expression in other perturbed systems as well, and allows researchers for the first time to assess the relative contributions of each of the three levels of protein level regulation - mRNA expression, translation, and degradation - in any perturbed system.","Published: February 16, 2015"

Study lead author Dr Sunjie Ye, who is based in both the School of Physics and Astronomy and the Leeds Institute for Biomedical and Clinical Sciences at the University of Leeds, said:  High recurrence rates of tumours after surgical removal remain a formidable challenge in cancer therapy. Chemo- or radiotherapy is often given following surgery to prevent this, but these treatments cause serious side effects. Gold nanotubes   that is, gold nanoparticles with tubular structures that resemble tiny drinking straws   have the potential to enhance the efficacy of these conventional treatments by integrating diagnosis and therapy in one single system.  The researchers say that a new technique to control the length of nanotubes underpins the research. By controlling the length, the researchers were able to produce gold nanotubes with the right dimensions to absorb a type of light called  near infrared . The study s corresponding author Professor Steve Evans, from the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leeds, said:  Human tissue is transparent for certain frequencies of light   in the red/infrared region. This is why parts of your hand appear red when a torch is shone through it.  When the gold nanotubes travel through the body, if light of the right frequency is shone on them they absorb the light. This light energy is converted to heat, rather like the warmth generated by the Sun on skin. Using a pulsed laser beam, we were able to rapidly raise the temperature in the vicinity of the nanotubes so that it was high enough to destroy cancer cells.  In cell-based studies, by adjusting the brightness of the laser pulse, the researchers say they were able to control whether the gold nanotubes were in cancer-destruction mode, or ready to image tumours. In order to see the gold nanotubes in the body, the researchers used a new type of  imaging technique called  multispectral optoacoustic tomography  (MSOT) to detect the gold nanotubes in mice, in which gold nanotubes had been injected intravenously. It is the first biomedical application of gold nanotubes within a living organism. It was also shown that gold nanotubes were excreted from the body and therefore are unlikely to cause problems in terms of toxicity, an important consideration when developing nanoparticles for clinical use.  Study co-author Dr James McLaughlan, from the School of Electronic & Electrical Engineering at the University of Leeds, said:  This is the first demonstration of the production, and use for imaging and cancer therapy, of gold nanotubes that strongly absorb light within the  optical window  of biological tissue.  The nanotubes can be tumour-targeted and have a central  hollow  core that can be loaded with a therapeutic payload.

In order to fully understand and address this variability, it is necessary to profile the properties of each individual cell, such as the interactions between its DNA, RNA and proteins. This has always been a challenge due to the technical and physical limitations associated with the fragility and small size of cells, as well as the large variety yet low amount of biomolecules they contain. EPFL scientists have now combined, for the first time, affinity beads with microfluidics to produce an integrated, highly sensitive method for studying single cells that could be soon used in clinical diagnostics. The pioneering work is published in the journal Small. There are two major obstacles for efficient single-cell analysis: first, the large number of different types of low quantity of biomolecules that have to be investigated in each cell. Second, the sheer number of cells that have to be processed, especially when trying to detect rare changes, which occur only in a few cells of a large population. The lab of Horst Vogel at EPFL was able to overcome these hurdles by combining several micro-technologies: Micrometer- to submicrometer-sized affinity beads transferred into cells, and extraction of these beads from individual cells in a microfluidic channel. In the technique, developed by PhD student Michael Werner, the target molecule inside a single cell is captured on (sub)micrometer-sized silicon beads, which have previously been coated with capture agents, e.g. antibodies, that can bind specifically to the target biomolecule in the cell. When taken up by a cell, the bead is first internalized in a closed intracellular cage called the phagosome. This creates a problem, as the phagosome keeps the bead from finding its target biomolecule inside the cell. In order to release the bead from the phagosome, the researchers used a photochemical trick. Along with the beads, they also incubated the cells with photosensitive molecules, which became incorporated into the phagosome s membrane. When light is shone on the cells, the photosensitive molecules disrupt the phagosome s membranes. With the membranes ruptured, the beads are now released inside the cell, where they capture and extract all of the target molecules from the cell s cytoplasm with high specificity. Next, the bead-containing cells are put through a microfluidic chip. This is a small device designed specifically to control the flow of tiny volumes of fluids across a network of small channels (100  m in width) etched into glass slides. The channels in this study are so narrow that cells can only pass through one at a time. The cells pass through a point in the channel where a  laser tweezer  (a highly focused laser beam) catches individual cells by interacting with their internalized beads. The trapped cells are then lysed, leaving only the beads with the bound target biomolecules in the laser trap. The beads are then analyzed directly inside the microfluidic device. In the EPFL study, the scientists explored a number of different cell types, providing a proof of concept for their new single-cell analysis method. The team is now working with the Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois (CHUV) in Lausanne to test their assay on cancer cells from actual tumors, which show enormous variability in signaling profiles between individual cells.  We hope that characterizing these variations will improve the treatment of the disease on an individual basis , says Horst Vogel.","Published: February 16, 2015"

Scientists at the universities have published the first study showing that children with autism spectrum disorder have differences in protein levels in their saliva when compared to typically developing children. The study appears in the journal Autism Research. Autism spectrum disorder currently affects one in 68 children in the United States, and the number of people diagnosed with autism continues to rise. Diagnosis is currently made based on behavioral observations, and no biological test for autism exists. A biological test could aid in earlier diagnosis, helping to direct people with autism to interventions. The researchers, led by Clarkson University doctoral candidate Armand Gatien Ngounou Wetie, studied saliva from six children diagnosed with autism, ages 6 to 16, compared to six typically developing children in the same age range. They used a technique known as mass spectrometry to measure protein differences in saliva taken from the two groups. ""We found nine proteins that were significantly elevated in the saliva of the people with autism and three that were lower or even absent,"" said Alisa G. Woods, a researcher at both Clarkson University and the SUNY Plattsburgh Center for Neurobehavioral Health who is one of the researchers leading the study. ""This is the first study to identify these changes in saliva, which is a relatively easy biofluid to obtain for clinical use or research."" The proteins identified primarily have functions in immune system responses or are elevated in people with gastrointestinal problems. The scientists also reported that several of the identified proteins interact with one another. ""We are the first in the world who proposed a protein complex as a potential biomarker signature, which gives us information not only about the proteins, their relative quantities and their modifications, but also about their interactions with other proteins,"" said Clarkson Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Biomolecular Science Costel C. Darie, a co-lead author and proteomics expert. The work is promising for the eventual development of an autism diagnostic test, but more subjects need to be studied to confirm the markers are consistently different in people with autism. ""We have found some interesting proteins that are different from children with autism compared with controls, and I think the next stage would be to increase the pool of samples to confirm those findings,"" Ngounou said. The group plans to further study these protein differences in larger groups of children with autism and also in specific subtypes of autism. Clarkson University   press release Armand G.

The research, led by Timothy Jegla, an assistant professor of biology at Penn State University, shows that many of these genes, which when mutated in humans can lead to neurological disease, first evolved in the common ancestor of people and a group of animals called cnidarians, which includes jellyfish, coral, and sea anemones. A paper describing the research is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""Our research group has been discovering evidence for a long time that most major signaling systems in our neurons are ancient, but we never really knew when they first appeared,"" Jegla said. ""We had always assumed that we would be able to trace most of these signaling systems to the earliest nervous systems, but in this paper we show that this is not the case. It looks like the majority of these signaling systems first appear in the common ancestor that humans share with jellyfish and sea anemones."" Electrical impulses in nerve cells are generated by charged molecules known as ions moving into and out of the cell through highly specialized ion-channel proteins that form openings in the cell membrane. The new research focuses on the functional evolution of the genes that encode the proteins for potassium channels -- ion channels that allow potassium to flow out of nerve cells, stopping the cell's electrical impulses. ""The channels are critical for determining how a nerve cell fires electrical signals,"" said Jegla. ""It appears that animals such as sea anemones and jellyfish are using the same channels that shape electrical signals in our brains in essentially the same way."" ""Humans and sea anemones went their separate ways evolutionarily speaking roughly 600 million years ago,"" said Jegla, ""so we know that the mechanisms we use to generate impulses in our neurons must be at least that old."" The team then tried to trace these channels back even further in evolutionary time -- to the very origins of the nervous system. ""One of the exciting recent findings in evolutionary biology is that the nervous system might be much older than the ancestor of sea anemones and humans,"" Jegla said. Recent genome sequences from comb jellies, which also have nervous systems, show that they are a more ancient group of animals than sea anemones and might even be the oldest type of animals that are still living today. ""When we looked at comb jellies, we found that the potassium channels looked very different -- most of the channel types found in humans were missing,"" said Jegla. ""We could trace only one kind of the human potassium channels that we looked at all the way back to comb jellies, but we find almost all of them in sea anemones."" The implication is that many of the mechanisms we use to control electrical impulses in our neurons were not present in the earliest nervous systems. The team did find many different potassium channels in comb jellies, but they appear to have evolved independently after the comb jelly lineage split from that of our ancestors. ""We don't know how complex electrical signaling is in living comb jellies, but it probably wasn't very complex in our common ancestor,"" said Jegla. The team now is interested in figuring out what drove the burst of innovation in ion channels in our common ancestor with sea anemones. ""We don't yet understand why our ion channels evolved at that time, but the changes in the ability of nerve cells to generate electrical signals must have been revolutionary,"" said Jegla. ""Our current favorite hypothesis is that neurons capable of directional signaling might have evolved at this time."" In human nervous systems, most nerve cells have a polar structure with separate regions for inputs and outputs. This allows for directional information flow and highly complex circuits of nerve cells, but it requires a huge diversity of ion channels to shape the electrical signals as they pass through the polar nerve cells. ""If our hypothesis turns out to be correct, we may be able to gain some important insights into how nerve cells and circuits evolved by studying sea anemones,"" said Jegla. ""There is a lot that remains to be discovered about how we build polar neurons, and we can use evolution to point out the really important mechanisms that have been conserved through animal history.""

Launched in March 2014, the three-year study has enrolled five of 10 participants and successfully implanted an auditory brainstem implant (ABI) device in four children who previously could not hear. The research team presented preliminary findings at the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences (AAAS) 2015 Annual Meeting in San Jose, California, on Feb. 14.  Initial activation of the ABI is like a newborn entering the world and hearing for the first time, which means these children will need time to learn to interpret what they are sensing through the device as  sound,  said audiologist Laurie Eisenberg, Ph.D., a Keck School of Medicine of USC otolaryngology professor and study co-leader.  All of our study participants whose ABIs have been activated are progressing at expected or better rates. We are optimistic that, with intensive training and family support, these children will eventually be able to talk on the phone.  Hearing loss manifests in various forms, most of which can be partially restored through hearing aids and cochlear implants. Those devices cannot help a small population of individuals who do not have a cochlear, or hearing, nerve   these people are unable to perceive sound, no matter how loud, outside of feeling vibration. The ABI is considered revolutionary because it stimulates neurons directly at the human brainstem, bypassing the inner ear entirely. Surgeons outside the United States have been doing ABI surgeries in children for more than 10 years, but there was never a formal safety or feasibility study under regulatory oversight. In the United States, the ABI is approved for use only in patients 12 years or older with neurofibromatosis type II, an inherited disease that causes a non-malignant brain tumor on the hearing nerve, but it has shown limited effectiveness in adults. Scientists believe that the ABI would be more effective in younger children, when their brains are more adaptable. The clinical trial will attempt to prove that the surgery is safe in young children and allow researchers to study how the brain develops over time and how it learns to hear sound and develop speech.  Hearing loss can be devastating to a child s social development, and for some children, the ABI is their last viable chance to hear,  said Keck School of Medicine of USC Professor Robert V. Shannon, Ph.D., an investigator for the trial and a leading scientist in the development of ABI technology since 1989.  Several of the young children who had ABIs implanted outside the United States have sought help at the USC-CHLA Center for Childhood Communication and we know that they now have the potential to understand speech. This really shows how powerful and flexible the brain is. By studying how the brain and the hearing system work together through this device, our team will set the gold standard for use of this technology.  The NIH clinical trial grant U01DC013031 covers the costs of the device, procedure and subsequent testing. To qualify for participation, patients aged 2 to 5 years old must show that standard treatment such as hearing aids and cochlear implants have been ineffective.

In preclinical studies using rodents, they found that stem cells transplanted one week after the completion of a series of chemotherapy sessions restored a range of cognitive functions, as measured one month later using a comprehensive platform of behavioral testing. In contrast, rats not treated with stem cells showed significant learning and memory impairment. The frequent use of chemotherapy to combat multiple cancers can produce severe cognitive dysfunction, often referred to as ""chemobrain,"" which can persist and manifest in many ways long after the end of treatments in as many as 75 percent of survivors - a problem of particular concern with pediatric patients. ""Our findings provide the first solid evidence that transplantation of human neural stem cells can be used to reverse chemotherapeutic-induced damage of healthy tissue in the brain,"" said Charles Limoli, a UCI professor of radiation oncology. Study results appear in the Feb. 15 issue of Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. Many chemotherapeutic agents used to treat disparate cancer types trigger inflammation in the hippocampus, a cerebral region responsible for many cognitive abilities, such as learning and memory. This inflammation can destroy neurons and other cell types in the brain. Additionally, these toxic compounds damage the connective structure of neurons, called dendrites and axons, and alter the integrity of synapses - the vital links that permit neurons to pass electrical and chemical signals throughout the brain. Limoli compares the process to a tree being pruned of its branches and leaves. Consequently, the affected neurons are less able to transmit important neural messages that underpin learning and memory. ""In many instances, people experience severe cognitive impairment that's progressive and debilitating,"" Limoli said. ""For pediatric cancer patients, the results can be particularly devastating, leading to reduced IQ, asocial behavior and diminished quality of life."" For the UCI study, adult neural stem cells were transplanted into the brains of rats after chemotherapy. They migrated throughout the hippocampus, where they survived and differentiated into multiple neural cell types. Additionally, these cells triggered the secretion of neurotrophic growth factors that helped rebuild wounded neurons. Importantly, Limoli and his colleagues found that engrafted cells protected the host neurons, thereby preventing the loss or promoting the repair of damaged neurons and their finer structural elements, referred to as dendritic spines. ""This research suggests that stem cell therapies may one day be implemented in the clinic to provide relief to patients suffering from cognitive impairments incurred as a result of their cancer treatments,"" Limoli said.

At the heart of this pathway lies PPAR  (peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor gamma), a protein that regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in normal cells. Researchers demonstrated that by activating PPAR  with antidiabetic drugs in lung cancer cells, they could stop these tumor cells from dividing.  We found that activation of PPAR  causes a major metabolic change in cancer cells that impairs their ability to handle oxidative stress,  said Dr. Ralf Kittler, Assistant Professor in the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development, the Department of Pharmacology, the Harold C. Simmons Cancer Center, and the Cecil H. and Ida Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences at UT Southwestern.  The increased oxidative stress ultimately inhibits the growth of the tumor. We found that activation of PPAR  killed both cancer cells grown in a dish and tumors in mice, in which we observed near complete tumor growth inhibition,  said Dr. Kittler, the John L. Roach Scholar in Biomedical Research of UT Southwestern s Endowed Scholars Program. The study, published in the journal Cell Metabolism, builds on a large body of work showing that metabolism in cancer cells is altered when compared to normal cells. Changes in metabolism can make cancer cells more vulnerable to therapeutic agents, which make them a good target to investigate for cancer therapy. The new research also extends earlier observations made by Dr. Steven Kliewer, Professor of Molecular Biology and Pharmacology, who first identified that thiazolidinediones target PPAR . Dr. Kliewer holds the Nancy B. and Jake L. Hamon Distinguished Chair in Basic Cancer Research. Dr. Kittler and his team determined that PPAR  activation triggers changes in glucose and lipid metabolism that cause an increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are highly reactive oxygen-containing molecules that damage cells when present at high levels, a phenomenon known as oxidative stress. It is this increase in ROS that eventually stops the cancer cells from dividing.  The abnormal metabolism in cancer cells frequently causes increased oxidative stress, and any further increase can  push  cancer cells over the cliff,  said Dr. Kittler, UT Southwestern s first Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) Scholar in Cancer Research. The findings suggest that targeting PPAR  could be a promising new therapeutic approach for lung cancer and potentially other cancers. The researchers saw that activating PPAR  caused similar molecular changes in breast cancer cells.  This is an important finding because the drugs that activate PPAR  include FDA-approved antidiabetic drugs that are relatively well tolerated compared to chemotherapy. Knowing their mechanism of action provides us with clues for selecting tumors that may be responsive to this treatment, for combining these drugs with anti-cancer drugs to make therapy more effective, and for developing markers to measure the response of tumors to these drugs in patients,  said Dr. Kittler, Director of the McDermott Next-Generation Sequencing Core at UT Southwestern.  Of course, further study will be required to determine the therapeutic effectiveness of PPAR -activating drugs for lung cancer treatment,  he added.","Published: February 14, 2015"
