But the reasons why some patients experience these dramatic responses to infections -- and others don't -- have been unclear. Now a research team led by investigators in the Center for Vascular Biology Research (CVBR) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) has shown that variations in the Tie2 gene, which is expressed on the inner surface of blood vessels, play an important role in patient responses. The new findings demonstrate that diminished Tie2 levels are associated with potentially devastating responses to infections, while higher Tie2 levels provide protection. This new discovery suggests that Tie2 could be an important target to help clinicians more quickly determine which patients are at highest risk of developing these life-threatening vascular complications following infectious disease. ""The complications arising from sepsis and other infections can appear rapidly and dramatically, leaving patients in absolutely terrible shape,"" said senior author Samir Parikh, MD, an investigator in BIDMC's CVBR and Division of Nephrology and Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""Patients might arrive at the hospital feeling generally unwell and within a few hours, can be in critical condition."" But, this is not the case for everyone: many other patients arrive at the hospital with the same infectious symptoms, but get no worse and go on to recover fully. In studying the host response to infections, researchers have for many years focused on the role of the innate immune system. More recently, the focus has broadened to include the role played by the body's vascular system. ""Improperly functioning blood vessels can have lethal consequences,"" explained Parikh. ""For example, when the lungs' small blood vessels become leaky, the lungs fill with water and stop working properly, resulting in an often fatal condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]. No matter what type of infection a patient has initially, if he or she goes on to develop vascular leakage, that patient is in trouble. We wanted to find out if the Tie2 protein played a role in determining whether or not patients experience these devastating vascular complications,"" said Parikh. The authors first determined in mouse models of several infections -- including the parasitic infection malaria, the viral infection influenza and the bacterial infection sepsis - that all animals had decreased levels of Tie2 compared to baseline levels. Subsequent experiments revealed that reduced Tie2 was indeed setting the stage for vascular leakage and ensuing clinical complications in the animal models. ""The Tie2 gene is essential for embryonic development and knockout mice without the Tie2 gene die in utero,"" said corresponding author Chandra Ghosh, PhD, a member of the Parikh laboratory at BIDMC. ""Interestingly, mice with a single copy of the gene behave normally until they are challenged with infections."" After genomic analysis identified common variants that influence Tie2 expression, the authors examined a cohort of more than 1,600 intensive care unit (ICU) patients overseen by the research group of coauthor David Christiani, MD, MPH, at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, to determine if variation in Tie2 expression was associated with the development of ARDS. Indeed, the members of the cohort who had genetic variants linked to low Tie2 levels were at higher risk for developing ARDS, while those with genetic variants linked to higher Tie2 levels were protected from this devastating complication. ""This discovery was exciting,"" said Parikh. ""It was an exact match with the variants we had just identified in the genomic analysis. It supported our hypothesis that greater amounts of Tie2 protein may help people handle the stress of infection, while less-than-normal amounts of the protein leave individuals vulnerable to these dangerous complications. ""Our research appears to offer the first genetic evidence that the Tie2 gene itself may be an important target to think about in terms of clinical development,"" added Parikh. ""Many more studies are needed to understand how the body's vasculature reacts to the stress of infection. These may not be massive differences at the level of genes and gene expression, but we think they are commonly present and of high enough magnitude that they could tip the scales. Many patients with severe infections are walking a fine line between recovery and deadly complications like ARDS. If the body is genetically hard-wired to better sustain Tie2 in those critical hours, it might put that patient's health on a whole different path.""","Published: February 17, 2016"

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/marker-identifies-most-basic-form-of-blood-stem-cell-200280,Marker Identifies Most Basic Form of Blood Stem Cell Nearly    years after the discovery of the hematopoietic stem cell  Stanford researchers have found a marker that allows them to study the version of these stem cells that continues to replicate  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. After a long series of experiments, researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have identified a unique cell marker that they say allows them to pick out the most fundamental form of the stem cell that gives rise to the blood and immune system. If confirmed, their finding would help settle long-standing controversies about the identity of these stem cells and their support cells. It also may pave the way for understanding how these cells maintain themselves, and provide scientists with the necessary information to grow blood stem cells in the laboratory or clinic. A paper describing the research was recently published. Irving Weissman, MD, a professor of pathology and of developmental biology at Stanford, is the senior author. In 1988, Weissman and his colleagues isolated the hematopoietic stem cell, which goes on to become the body s blood and immune cells. Since that time, researchers have had only mixed success in their attempts to get a detailed picture of how these HSCs maintain themselves and grow in the body. Over the years, it became clear why. The hematopoietic stem cells they isolated came in two flavors: most are short-term HSCs that lose their powers of replication over time, while a small fraction are long-term HSCs that can replicate indefinitely and are critical to lifelong blood production. To understand how other cells nurture the HSC, researchers needed to study only the long-term HSC. With the new study, the Stanford researchers believe they have now found a reliable way to tell the difference between long-term and short-term HSCs.  In this paper we have found a single marker that, in the entire bone marrow, is only found in these long-term stem cells,  said Weissman, who is also the Virginia and D.K. Ludwig Professor in Clinical Investigation in Cancer Research and the director of the Stanford Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine. Now that the researchers can identify the long-term HSCs, they hope to be able to look at how those cells and nearby cells create a  niche    a biological space where long-term stem cells are supported and maintained.  For nearly 30 years, people have been trying to grow HSCs outside the body and have not been able to do it   it s arguably the  holy grail  in this field,  said James Y. Chen, an MD/PhD candidate at Stanford and co-lead author of the paper.  Now that we have an anchor, a way to look at long-term HSCs, we can look at the cells around them to understand and, ideally, recreate the niche.  If that niche can be created in a laboratory setting, people may be able to grow long-term HSCs in the lab. A two-year search In the last decades, many scientists have proposed various markers that they felt were unique to long-term HSCs, but the reliability of each proposed marker has been heatedly debated by other research groups, said postdoctoral scholar Masanori Miyanishi, MD, PhD, the other lead author. To settle the issue, Chen and Miyanishi devised a method that was highly systematic, but also expensive and time-consuming.  Many times, we were about to quit,  Chen said. It s arguably the  holy grail  in this field. They started with a list of over 100 genes that are expressed in the bone marrow, where long-term HSCs are found, that seemed like good candidates to be unique markers of long-term HSCs. With the assistance of their colleagues, they eliminated genes that are turned on in areas of the bone that don t involve the creation of new blood and immune cells. That narrowed the field to 45 genes. Then they performed a sophisticated, painstaking analysis to determine how much protein these genes were making in various cells. They found that only three proteins were produced at a high enough level to mark HSCs. Finally, they needed to find if one of these three was turned on in long-term HSCs and turned off in short-term HSCs. Although they couldn t yet identify which cells were long-term HSCs, they knew that any collection of HSCs should have both long-term and short-term HSCs, so they expected to find the candidate gene turned completely off in some cells and on in others. They found that only one gene fit that bill: a gene called Hoxb5. The researchers point out that there may be other unique markers of long-term HSCs, such as genes that weren t among the initial group of the more than 100 they screened. But among the screened genes, only Hoxb5 was a unique identifier of the long-term stem cell. Finding the niche The researchers were also able to solve another key mystery by showing where in the bone marrow long-term HSCs reside. Satoshi Yamazaki, PhD, a member of the Tokyo lab of Stanford genetics professor Hiromitsu Nakauchi, MD, PhD, used technology recently developed in Japan to prepare bone marrow tissue and do computational analysis that validated the location and architecture of the HSC niche.  More than 90 percent of these cells reside on a particular type of blood vessel called venous sinusoids,  said Nakauchi, a co-author of the paper. The ability to identify long-term stem cells will give scientists a powerful tool for further study, the researchers said.  This opens the way to observe long-term HSCs and other cells in the niche as they exist in the body, without transplanting them,  said Weissman, who is also director of the Ludwig Center for Cancer Stem Cell Research and Medicine.  This is how science works, by getting down to the purest irreducible element   in this case, blood stem cells   in order to develop new tools and understandings. ","Published: February 17, 2016"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/visualizing-a-parasite-crossing-the-blood-brain-barrier-213717,Visualizing a Parasite Crossing the Blood Brain Barrier An estimated    percent of the world s population is chronically infected with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Most people live with the infection without noticeable effect, but it can be life-threatening for people with suppressed immune systems, such as people on cancer therapies or who have HIV/AIDS. Pregnant women can also pass an infection to their unborn children, putting the babies at risk of severe neurological disease. It s known that  Toxo  can affect the brain, even influencing the behavior of its hosts. But scientists have debated exactly how the parasite crosses the blood-brain barrier, a physical obstacle intended to keep pathogens out of the brain. Now, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine and colleagues from across the country have identified how the parasite makes its way in. Using a powerful imaging technique that allowed the scientists to track the presence and movement of parasites in living tissues, the researchers found that Toxoplasma infects the brain s endothelial cells, which line blood vessels, reproduces inside of them, and then moves on to invade the central nervous system.  Crossing the blood-brain barrier is a rare event in part because this structure is designed to protect the brain from pathogens,  said Christopher Hunter, the Mindy Halikman Heyer President s Distinguished Professor at Penn Vet.  And yet it happens and we have now been able to visualize these events. It s something that no one had seen before.  By illuminating the pathogen s path into the brain, the research helps inform what treatment strategies may be most effective at combatting the parasite before it wreaks its worst damage. Hunter was the senior author on the study, which was led by Christoph Konradt, a post-doctoral researcher in Hunter s laboratory. A few different theories have been considered to explain how Toxoplasma could enter the brain. Some believe the parasite squeezes between the barrier cells, while others think the parasite goes directly through a cell. Another idea,  beloved of microbiologists,  Hunter said, is the Trojan horse hypothesis, in which the parasite hitches a ride across the barrier while hidden inside an infected host cell. Konradt used Penn Vet s multi-photon microscope, which allows them to peer deep into living tissues without damaging them, to try to witness the parasite s invasion in action. In these studies, they used mice that had been specially bred to express a fluorescent green protein in their endothelial cells. They then infected the mice with modified Toxoplasma that expressed a red fluorescent protein. After a week, they saw endothelial cells in the brain that were infected, as well as evidence that the parasite was reproducing inside those cells. Two weeks post-infection, they saw that parasites appeared in the brain tissue adjacent to the endothelial cells. In additional experiments, they were able to visualize parasites bursting out of infected  endothelial cells, thereby introducing the parasite into the brain. The researchers also wanted to revisit the Trojan horse hypothesis, to see if, as had been proposed, infected monocytes, a type of immune cell, might be responsible for carrying the parasite into the brain. To test this, the team infected monocytes with a form of Toxo, labeled red, that can t reproduce, then introduced those cells into mice. If the monocytes were indeed acting as a Trojan horse, the scientists would expect to see the parasite breach the blood-brain barrier. But they only saw infected cells within blood vessels, and these cells were not able to cross the blood brain barrier. To further illuminate the mechanism by which Toxo infects and disseminates through the body, the researchers looked specifically at levels of free parasites, that is, parasites that had not already infected or become engulfed by a host cell. They were surprised to see that a significant portion, around a third of the mouse s total parasite load, existed as free parasites in the blood.  I think we expected to see a small number of parasites outside cells, because they have to come out to move from cell to cell,  Konradt said.  But I don't think anyone had fully appreciated the sheer number of parasites that are free and able to infect other cells in the vasculature.  This presence of free parasites was, however, transient. By 10 days after infection, most mice had no free parasites in their blood.  From a treatment perspective,  Hunter said,  that means if a pregnant woman gets infected for the first time, there is a fairly short period of time when the parasite can cross the placenta and affect the fetus. That tells us that targeting these stages in the blood during this narrow window could be effective at preventing congenital transmission.  As a final test to see whether parasites could directly access the brain from the blood, the researchers infected mice with a mixture of normal parasites and mutants that was unable to reproduce, each labeled in different colors. They then showed that only the normal, reproducing parasite made its way into the functional brain tissue.  This shows that the parasite has to replicate in order to spread from the blood into other tissues,  Konradt said.  That could mean a drug that blocks replication could be effective at preventing dissemination.  The team s findings suggest that the current theories about how Toxoplasma crosses the blood-brain barrier are probably not the main way the brain is infected. Rather, parasites move directly from the blood into endothelial cells, where they replicate, cause the cell to burst and then infect neighboring brain cells. Beyond its implications for Toxoplasma infections, the research may give insights into how other viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens may move from the blood into the brain.  Toxo is a really nice model for studying vascular immunity in general,  Konradt said.","Published: February 17, 2016"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-bacterial-infections-spread-in-the-body-197183,How Bacterial Infections Spread in the Body The finding offers new leads for fighting infection without contributing to one of the world s most pressing public health concerns   antibiotic resistance  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Bacteria have evolved thousands of clever tactics for invading our bodies while evading our natural defenses. Now, UNC School of Medicine scientists studying one of the world s most virulent pathogens and a separate very common bacterium have discovered a new way that some bacteria use to spread rapidly throughout the body   by hitchhiking on our own immune cells.   The new UNC School of Medicine study shows that at least two bacterial species are capable of spreading in this manner: Francisella tularensis (F. tularensis), which causes a potentially lethal infection known as tularemia, and Salmonella enterica, a common cause of foodborne illness. The discovery offers a potential way to fight bacterial infections without contributing to one of the world s most pressing public health problems   antibiotic resistance.   More and more, we ve been looking for ways to control disease without specific antimicrobial therapies, because pathogens inevitably develop resistance to those,  said Tom Kawula, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology and senior author.  By figuring out this new way pathogens can disseminate within a host, we can now try to inhibit the host processes involved. If we could inhibit these processes, then pathogens would not develop resistance to treatment.  Kawula and his team have studied F. tularensis for years because of its remarkable virulence. Exposure to as few as 10 of these pernicious microbes can lead to full-blown infection in a matter of hours. Although F. tularensis is not known to spread from person to person, it infects hundreds of animal species and is transmitted from these animals to humans by ticks and mosquitoes. Tularemia symptoms include fever, body pain and respiratory problems; the bacterium has also been developed as a bioweapon. The discovery revolves around the interaction between F. tularensis and immune cells known as macrophages. Drawing their name from Greek roots meaning  big eater,  macrophages are part of the body s first line of defenses against infection. These large cells specialize in detecting foreign invaders, which they typically swallow whole. Pitting macrophages and F. tularensis against each other in cell cultures, the research team discovered that if macrophages are like knights guarding a castle, then F. tularensis is like an invading army that eludes detection by hiding within the ranks of the knights. Kawula s team found that the bacteria not only survived inside the macrophages but also interfered with the natural cell death process that is typically triggered in infected cells in order to protect the whole of the organism. The result is that F. tularensis keeps its macrophage host alive for about 36 hours, giving the pathogen plenty of time to spread to other cells. Even more remarkable was how the bacteria moved from cell to cell: through a little-understood natural process called trogocytosis. During trogocytosis, two cells bump against each other, exchange a few surface proteins and then separate. It was during these brief, hug-like encounters that F. tularensis slipped quietly from one macrophage to another. The study in eLifeis the first to show that pathogens can use trogocytosis to infect new cells.  Although trogocytosis usually occurs somewhat infrequently, follow-up experiments revealed thatF. tularensis not only takes advantage of the process but also induces macrophages to do it more frequently, thus speeding up the pathogen s rate of spreading.   If trogocytosis turns out to be crucial to a pathogen s ability to cause disease, we might be able to disrupt this process, even just for a few days, and fight the infection without using antibiotics,  Kawula said. Drugs that cause changes within a person s own body, rather than targeting the invading pathogen directly, are more likely to be effective in the long term, he said, because pathogens are less likely to evolve resistance to them.  In addition, the new research provides a foot in the door for scientists to learn more about trogocytosis.  Nobody knows what drives trogocytosis, but previous studies suggested it is probably involved in the development of immunity and potentially in how the body controls tumors,  Kawula said.  Now that we have a bacterial agent that we know increases trogocytosis, we can hopefully leverage that to investigate its role in these other processes, in addition to the spread of infection.  After confirming the role of trogocytosis in F. tularensis infection, the researchers pitted macrophages against a different bacterium, Salmonella enterica. The results showed Salmonella enterica uses the exact same process, albeit at a lower rate of speed. It is unclear whether other bacteria or viruses might spread using the same mechanism.","Published: February 17, 2016"

To turn genes on or off, a methyl group can be added to or removed from DNA. During the removal of this chemical tag, called demethylation, the methyl group is converted to 5hmC as an intermediate step. The TET enzymes are thought to be critical to the demethylation process. Recent research has shown that 5hmC is associated with an ""opening up"" of nearby chromatin, the tightly packaged assembly of proteins and DNA in the cell nucleus. The team reveals that 5hmC localizes near breaks in DNA that develop naturally or that are caused by DNA-damaging drugs or irradiation. They also found that inhibiting TET enzymes in cells resulted in a lack of 5hmC, followed by errors in chromosome separation. This suggests that TET enzymes are important for the production of 5hmC at DNA damage sites and that both play critical roles in responding to DNA damage. The research raises the possibility that 5hmC helps to keep chromatin ""open"" so it can be more accessible to other DNA damage response proteins. 5hmC could be used as a marker for DNA damage, say the researchers. ""Our results imply that loss of TET enzymes and 5hmC depletion could contribute significantly to genome instability and inaccurate chromosome segregation, perhaps explaining the correlation of low 5hmC levels with cancer,"" say the researchers.","Published: February 17, 2016"

A team of researchers from the University of Bristol and Oxford University have suggested that a GWAS for a disease should also identify genetic variants that predict behaviours that increase the risk of the disease as well. If this is the case, GWAS may be useful places to look for potentially modifiable risk factors for disease, which could then be targeted by medics for interventions. Professor Marcus Munafo, the study's lead author, said: ""Genome-wide association studies of lung cancer have identified genetic variants that strongly predict smoking. It is possible these genetic variants have independent effects on both smoking and lung cancer, but it seems far more likely that this variant was seen because smoking causes lung cancer. ""Genetic predictors for lifestyle are still being identified. We already know about variants that predict smoking, alcohol or caffeine use, and research is ongoing to predict things like cannabis use. As larger GWASs of disease are carried out, more of these variants which indicate the causal modifiable risk factors for disease will be identified. This will help the development of more effective and better-targeted interventions.

However, with chronic diseases, reactive T cells often become inactive or even disappear. Recent advances have brought the idea of fighting chronic infections, and even cancers, by restoring protective T cell responses much closer to reality.  The main focus of the AAAS 2016 session ""Fighting Cancer and Chronic Infections with T Cell Therapy: Promise and Progress""is on adoptive T cell therapy, in which a patient receives ""killer"" immune cells that target a disease-associated molecule. Several obstacles have stood in the way of widespread clinical use: identifying or generating T cells that will be most effective for each individual case, whether from the patient or from a suitable donor; avoiding or countering potential side-effects; and finding ways to shorten the path from bench to bedside. Progress is being reported on all three fronts, including data from the first clinical trials.  Potent cells, with a safety mechanism ""There is a lot of scientific competition, of course, as well as growing industry interest,"" says Prof. Dirk Busch. ""What we bring into the game is, first, the conviction that you have to select the right cells to generate optimal cell products for therapy, together with superior techniques to do it. Over the past years, we at TUM as well as Stan Riddell and Chiara Bonini have worked on providing cell products that will upon tranfer to patients expand to large numbers and stay active for a long time, potentially life-long. We identified a subset of T cells with high regenerative potential, where even low numbers of transferred cells   in the extreme a single T cell   can confer therapeutic immune responses."" The use of such potent cells, he adds, requires the implementation of safety mechanisms, and that too has now been demonstrated. Within the TUM Institute for Advanced Study (TUM-IAS) Focus Group on Clinical Cell Processing and Purification, Busch, Riddell, and colleagues have pioneered methods to rapidly select defined T cell subsets for clinical applications. Central memory T cells (TCMs) are of special interest: TCMs can engraft, expand, and persist long-term, even at very low numbers of transferred cells. Also, they can be genetically engineered to express novel antigen-targeting receptors without affecting their in vivo behavior. The first clinical trials using engineered T cells expressing so-called chimeric antigen receptors that recognize an antigen on B cell leukemia (anti-CD19-CARs) have provided outstanding results   including cases of complete remission of end-stage, blood-borne malignancies. Encouraging results have also been seen in clinical trials of adoptive T cell therapy against chronic infections. At the same time, the researchers are exploring safeguards that would allow, in the event of side-effects, selective elimination of the genetically modified T cells used for therapy. One such safety mechanism has been tested successfully in pre-clinical animal models and has already been transferred to human patients. ""We put a marker into the T cells, so that we can give an antibody that binds to the cells that we have engineered but no others,"" Busch explains. ""If an antibody binds to a cell, then other immune mechanisms get activated that eliminate it. We call this antibody-mediated cell toxicity."" The broader goal is to make sure the therapeutic cell products are so well understood and defined   and backed up by safety mechanisms   that the same approach can be confidently used to treat different patients, on an individualized basis. ""We believe the more defined our cell products are, the more predictable the clinical outcome will be,"" Busch says.  Technology developed at TUM helped to launch a spin-off company called STAGE Cell Therapeutics, which has merged with Seattle-based Juno Therapeutics. The Munich-based Juno Therapeutics GmbH is the company's European arm. This research was supported in part by the German Research Foundation (DFG), the TUM Institute for Advanced Study, and Juno Therapeutics.","Published: February 17, 2016"

Now researchers from Brown University s School of Engineering have made an important fundamental advance that could make such devices more practical. The research team has developed a technique that eliminates the need for highly specialized external light sources that deliver coherent light, which the technique normally requires. The advance could enable more versatile and more compact devices.  It has always been assumed that coherent light was necessary for plasmonic interferometry,  said Domenico Pacifici, a professor of engineering who oversaw the work with his postdoctoral researcher Dongfang Li, and graduate student Jing Feng.  But we were able to disprove that assumption.  Plasmonic interferometers make use of the interaction between light and surface plasmon polaritons, density waves created when light energy rattles free electrons in a metal. One type of interferometer looks like a bull s-eye structure etched into a thin layer of metal. In the center is a hole poked through the metal layer with a diameter of about 300 nanometers about 1,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. The hole is encircled by a series of etched grooves, with diameters of a few micrometers. Thousands of these bulls-eyes can be placed on a chip the size of a fingernail. When light from an external source is shown onto the surface of an interferometer, some of the photons go through the central hole, while others are scattered by the grooves. Those scattered photons generate surface plasmons that propagate through the metal inward toward the hole, where they interact with photons passing through the hole. That creates an interference pattern in the light emitted from the hole, which can be recorded by a detector beneath the metal surface. When a liquid is deposited on top of an interferometer, the light and the surface plasmons propagate through that liquid before they interfere with each other. That alters the interference patterns picked up by the detector depending on the chemical makeup of the liquid or compounds present in it. By using different sizes of groove rings around the hole, the interferometers can be tuned to detect the signature of specific compounds or molecules. With the ability to put many differently tuned interferometers on one chip, engineers can hypothetically make a versatile detector. Up to now, all plasmonic interferometers have required the use of highly specialized external light sources that can deliver coherent light beams in which light waves are parallel, have the same wavelength, and travel in-phase (meaning the peaks and valleys of the waves are aligned). Without coherent light sources, the interferometers cannot produce usable interference patterns. Those kinds of light sources, however, tend to be bulky, expensive, and require careful alignment and periodic recalibration to obtain a reliable optical response. But Pacifici and his group have come up with a way to eliminate the need for external coherent light. In the new method, fluorescent light-emitting atoms are integrated directly within the tiny hole in the center of the interferometer. An external light source is still necessary to excite the internal emitters, but it need not be a specialized coherent source.  This is a whole new concept for optical interferometry,  Pacifici said,  an entirely new device.  In this new device, incoherent light shown on the interferometer causes the fluorescent atoms inside the center hole to generate surface plasmons. Those plasmons propagate outward from the hole, bounce off the groove rings, and propagate back toward the hole after. Once a plasmon propagates back, it interacts with the atom that released it, causing an interference with the directly transmitted photon. Because the emission of a photon and the generation of a plasmon are indistinguishable, alternative paths originating from the same emitter, the process is naturally coherent and interference can therefore occur even though the emitters are excited incoherently.  The important thing here is that this is a self-interference process,  Pacifici said.  It doesn t matter that you re using incoherent light to excite the emitters, you still get a coherent process.  In addition to eliminating the need for specialized external light sources, the approach has several advantages, Pacifici said. Because the surface plasmons travel out from the hole and back again, they probe the sample on top of the interferometer surface twice. That makes the device more sensitive. But that s not the only advantage. In the new device, external light can be projected from underneath the metal surface containing the interferometers instead of from above. That eliminates the need for complex illumination architectures on top of the sensing surface, which could make for easier integration into compact devices. The embedded light emitters also eliminate the need to control the amount of sample liquid deposited on the interferometer s surface. Large droplets of liquid can cause lensing effects, a bending of light that can scramble the results from the interferometer. Most plasmonic sensors make use of tiny microfluidic channels to deliver a thin film of liquid to avoid lensing problems. But with internal light emitters excited from the bottom surface, the external light never comes in contact with the sample, so lensing effects are negated, as is the need for microfluidics. Finally, the internal emitters produce a low intensity light. That s good for probing delicate samples, such as proteins, than can be damaged by high-intensity light. More work is required to get the system out of the lab and into devices, and Pacifici and his team plan to continue to refine the idea. The next step will be to try eliminating the external light source altogether. It might be possible, the researchers say, to eventually excite the internal emitters using tiny fiber optic lines, or perhaps electric current. Still, this initial proof-of-concept is promising, Pacifici said.  From a fundamental standpoint, we think this new device represents a significant step forward,  he said,  a first demonstration of plasmonic interferometry with incoherent light.""","Published: February 17, 2016"

Those hotspots appear in genes associated with brain tumors and a number of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions. The findings raise new questions about the origins of these conditions as well as how the brain generates a diversity of circuitry during development. The study s roots reach back more than 30 years, when study senior author Frederick Alt, the HMS Charles A. Janeway Professor of Pediatrics and director of the Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine at Boston Children s, and his colleagues first started investigating the links between tumors, oncogenes, DNA breaks and DNA repair, particularly in immune and nerve cells. Over the course of several studies, Alt s lab discovered that nerve cells lacking one particular DNA repair pathway called non-homologous end joining, which cannot repair breaks in their DNA strands, either die off early in development or give rise to brain tumors called medulloblastomas. However, Alt s lab and others have struggled to understand why the loss of this pathway would have such dramatic effects.  We ve thought a lot about DNA breaks,  said Alt, who is also a professor of genetics at HMS.  Many people over the years have considered the possibility that DNA breaks could be important for generating diversity in neural development. But nobody has had a way to identify the breaks in neural cells that would lead to this almost complete block of nervous system development in the absence of non-homologous end joining.  In recent years, Alt s lab engineered a method for mapping DNA breaks throughout the genome at very fine resolution, called high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing. Alt has also used this method, which was initially developed to understand how genes reshuffle or translocate in cancer, to measure the precision of CRISPR gene editing and to probe how the genome prevents DNA-snipping enzymes from cutting genes in places they shouldn t. In the current study, Alt lab members and colleagues used high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing and informatics techniques to search for and map DNA break patterns in mouse neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs, cells that produce the brain s neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) under conditions of replication stress. The experiments revealed 27 clear, recurring hotspots where the NSPC genomes break frequently. Strikingly, those 27 break hotspots were all spread across the bodies of 27 individual genes. Those genes shared a number of characteristics. All were long, mostly more than 100 kilobases, with multiple exons (coding segments) and long introns (non-coding segments). Most were late replicators, meaning they were copied late in the cell division process. They encoded proteins found on the surface of neurons that mostly perform functions that help neurons communicate (e.g., synapse formation, cell-cell adhesion). And 24 of the 27 genes have been linked to tumor suppression and/or neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  In our dreams, we couldn t have found a set of genes to better fit the hypothesis that breaking DNA in neural cells is important,  Alt said. The breaks the team identified appeared most frequently in the genes  introns, leading the team to speculate that the hotspots might have a distinct purpose: to help the brain generate a diverse repertoire of circuitry.  Because the breaks occur mostly between exons, they would likely, in some cases, cause an exon or two to be deleted and potentially allow the gene to produce a different protein,  Alt explained. By splicing genes  exons in different ways, the genome could generate several variations of the proteins the genes encode. The neurons that develop from the NPSCs could then wire themselves into unique neural circuits.  The protein encoded by one of the genes we identified, neurexin, potentially has more than 1,000 different forms, some of which may make connections between neurons of different strengths,  said Pei-Chi Wei, a postdoctoral fellow in the Alt lab.  What we found could provide a mechanism for making a diversity of synaptic connections and make contacts between neurons different.   During neural development, you generate a whole brain, with some 100 billion neurons, from a relatively limited number of NSPCs,  added Bjoern Schwer, HMS assistant professor of pediatrics in the Alt lab.  In this context, is there a potential advantage to having recurrent DNA breaks? It could be a way to sample different combinations of circuits and synapses, almost like evolution in miniature.  We don t know for sure that this is the case,  he continued,  but we now show that these replication stress-associated breaks that occur during neural development could be a way to contribute to the perceived diversity of neural cells that end up in the mature brain.  The team also speculates, based on their findings, that replication stress-associated DNA damage during neural development could, by affecting these genes, promote neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric diseases.  Virtually all of these genes have been associated with diseases that have a neurodevelopmental component,  said Schwer.  It could be that when you can t efficiently repair breaks within genes, it could predispose the individual to neurodevelopmental disease. ","Published: February 17, 2016"

The finding could help identify otherwise healthy users who are most at risk of developing psychosis. The research, funded by the Medical Research Council and published in Translational Psychiatry, also show that female cannabis smokers are potentially more susceptible to short-term memory loss than males. Previous studies in this field have looked at people who already have psychosis, but this is the first study to look at healthy people and to examine their acute response or how the drug affects their minds. See Also: Researchers study differences in ischemic stroke in marijuana users Previous research has found a link between the AKT1 gene and people who have gone on to develop psychosis. In the new study, Celia Morgan, Professor of Psychopharmacology at the University of Exeter and Professor Val Curran and her team from UCL found that young people with variation in the 'AKT1' gene experienced visual distortions, paranoia and other psychotic-like symptoms more strongly when they were under the influence of cannabis. Around one per cent of cannabis users develop psychosis. Although low in number, the impact can be devastating and long lasting. It is known that smoking cannabis daily doubles an individual's risk of developing a psychotic disorder, but it has been difficult to establish who is most vulnerable. Researchers have previously found a high prevalence of one variant of the AKT1 genotype in cannabis users who went on to develop psychosis as a result of their use. This is the first research that shows the link between the same gene and the effects of smoked cannabis in healthy young people. It is hoped that it will help identify those most at risk of the negative effects of cannabis smoking and may aid the development of genotype targeted medication. Professor Morgan said: ""These findings are the first to demonstrate that people with this AKT1 genotype are far more likely to experience strong effects from smoking cannabis, even if they are otherwise healthy. To find that having this gene variant means that you are more prone to mind-altering affects of cannabis when you don't have psychosis gives us a clue as to how it increases risk in healthy people. Putting yourself repeatedly in a psychotic or paranoid state might be one reason why these people could go on to develop psychosis when they might not have done otherwise. Although cannabis-induced psychosis is very rare, when it happens it can have a terrible impact on the lives of young people. This research could help pave the way towards the prevention and treatment of cannabis psychosis."" Professor Curran added: ""The current study is the largest ever to be conducted on the acute response to cannabis. Our finding that psychotic-like symptoms when young people are 'stoned' are predicted by AKT1 variants is an exciting breakthrough as this acute reaction is thought to be a marker of a person's risk of developing psychosis from smoking the drug."" Learn More: Mulling the marijuana munchies: How the brain flips the hunger switch The study involved 442 young cannabis users who were tested while under the influence of the drug, and while sober. The researchers measured the extent of the symptoms of intoxication and effect on memory loss and compared it to results seven days later when the young people were drug free. They found that those who with this variation in the AKT1 geneotpye were more likely to experience a psychotic response. As part of the study, researchers gained permission from the Home Office (UK) to analyze the cannabis samples for their make-up and strength. Samples were dropped off at a police station and analyzed by the forensic science service. The research also found that females were more vulnerable than males to impairment in short term memory after smoking cannabis. ""Animal studies have found that males have more of the receptors that cannabis works on in parts of the brain important in short term memory, such as the prefrontal cortex. We need further research in this area, but our findings indicate that men could be less sensitive to the memory impairing effects of cannabis than females,"" added Professor Morgan.

We discovered associations between Neanderthal DNA and a wide range of traits, including immunological, dermatological, neurological, psychiatric and reproductive diseases Our main finding is that Neanderthal DNA does influence clinical traits in modern humans: We discovered associations between Neanderthal DNA and a wide range of traits, including immunological, dermatological, neurological, psychiatric and reproductive diseases,  said John Capra, senior author of the paper  The phenotypic legacy of admixture between modern humans and Neanderthals  published in the Feb. 12 issue of the journal Science. The evolutionary geneticist is an assistant professor of biological sciences at Vanderbilt University. Some of the associations that Capra and his colleagues found confirm previous hypotheses. One example is the proposal that Neanderthal DNA affects cells called keratinocytes that help protect the skin from environmental damage such as ultraviolet radiation and pathogens. The new analysis found Neanderthal DNA variants influence skin biology in modern humans, in particular the risk of developing sun-induced skin lesions called keratosis, which are caused by abnormal keratinocytes. In addition, there were a number of surprises. For example, they found that a specific bit of Neanderthal DNA significantly increases risk for nicotine addiction. They also found a number of variants that influence the risk for depression: some positively and some negatively. In fact, a surprisingly number of snippets of Neanderthal DNA were associated with psychiatric and neurological effects, the study found.  The brain is incredibly complex, so it s reasonable to expect that introducing changes from a different evolutionary path might have negative consequences,  said Vanderbilt doctoral student Corinne Simonti, the paper s first author. According to the researchers, the pattern of associations that they discovered suggest that today s population retains Neanderthal DNA that may have provided modern humans with adaptive advantages 40,000 years ago as they migrated into new non-African environments with different pathogens and levels of sun exposure. However, many of these traits may no longer be advantageous in modern environments. One example is a Neanderthal variant that increases blood coagulation. It could have helped our ancestors cope with new pathogens encountered in new environments by sealing wounds more quickly and preventing pathogens from entering the body. In modern environments this variant has become detrimental, because hyper coagulation increases risk for stroke, pulmonary embolism and pregnancy complications. In order to discover these associations, the researchers used a database containing 28,000 patients whose biological samples have been linked to anonymized versions of their electronic health records. The data came from eMERGE   the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute   which links digitized records from Vanderbilt University Medical Center s BioVU databank and eight other hospitals around the country. This data allowed the researchers to determine if each individual had ever been treated for a specific set of medical conditions, such as heart disease, arthritis or depression. Next they analyzed the genomes of each individual to identify the unique set of Neanderthal DNA that each person carried. By comparing the two sets of data, they could test whether each bit of Neanderthal DNA individually and in aggregate influences risk for the traits derived from the medical records.  Vanderbilt s BioVU and the network of similar databanks from hospitals across the country were built to enable discoveries about the genetic basis of disease,  said Capra.  We realized that we could use them to answer important questions about human evolution.  According to the evolutionary geneticist, this work establishes a new way to investigate questions about the effects of events in recent human evolution.","Published: February 16, 2016"

The findings are published in the journal Analytical Chemistry. The ability to visualize, detect and track specific proteinsis highly desirable for scientists working in a variety of disciplines, such as disease diagnostics and cell biology. To this end, 'fluorogenic probes' are often used - molecular dyes which bind to target molecules and fluoresce in response to the surrounding microenvironment. Some probes hold the ability to change color and 'turn on' (known as CCTO), emitting a much brighter light upon recognition of the target molecule. There are some issues with the use of fluorogenic probes. For example, adding a fluorescent molecule (or fluorophore) into a peptide or ligand capable of binding to the target can sometimes inhibit correct binding, causing a weak link. Moreover, current fluorogenic probes are built only for certain specific protein-ligand pairs, and the search is on for a way to find probes suitable for a wider range of targets. Now, Masumi Taki and co-workers at the University of Electro-Communications in Tokyo, together with co-workers in Japan and the USA, have synthesized a diverse fluorogenic probe library using a form of the fluorescent dye Prodan and phage display technology based on bacteriophage T7. The team selected the protein glutathione S-transferase (GST) as their target for a proof-of-concept study. Their probe library yielded GST-specific CCTO probes, which changed color upon binding from yellow to cyan. The intensity of the cyan fluorescence also increased upon target recognition. The color-change ability is most highly prized, because an obvious signal such as this can result in less ambiguous read-outs when searching for specific targets. Further trials using the new probe library will help Taki and his team determine its advantages and limitations.","Published: February 16, 2016"

Visional Medical is a new organisation based in the UK and India that aims to deliver better diagnostic tests to the developing world. Visional Medical works closely with obstetricians and midwives throughout India to raise awareness and improve education on the benefits of using NIPT and establish links with local hospitals and clinics. There are nearly 26 million births every year in India but many pregnant women do not have access to any form of prenatal screening. However, this is changing and the private market for NIPT is growing rapidly - especially in the country s metropolitan areas. Visional Medical will provide pregnant women in India access to the IONA  test to safely and accurately estimate the risk of a fetus being affected by serious genetic disorders, including Down s, Edwards  and Patau s syndrome. The IONA  test only requires a sample of maternal blood to analyse cell-free fetal DNA and provide a result. Blood samples from these pregnant women will be sent to Premaitha s CQC-registered clinical service laboratory in Manchester where they will be analysed using the IONA  test and the results sent directly to healthcare professionals in India. Dr Stephen Little, CEO of Premaitha said:  The potential market for NIPT in India is huge   there are millions of pregnancies every year and currently little provision of any prenatal screening. Our partnership with Visional Medical will provide a risk-free, rapid and reliable prenatal screening test to address this unmet medical need.  This partnership also expands the geographical reach of Premaitha s IONA  test into Asia for the first time and marks the fourth such agreement that we have made with specialist regional partners in the past three months. As we continue to accelerate our global footprint and reach of NIPT with the IONA  test, we can provide more expectant mothers with the benefits of using a safe, accurate and stress-free test.  Dr Colin Ferrett, CEO of Visional Medical said:  We are thrilled to be working with Premaitha and we look forward to offering this advanced yet simple screening test to improve prenatal provision to the large population of pregnant mothers in India. Visional Medical s mission is to work with cutting edge diagnostic tools to advance healthcare into the 21st century for the developing world.

Elias Kaiser, crop physiologist at Wageningen UR, publishes this new insight in his PhD thesis that he will be defending at Wageningen University. Plants and algae are the basis of life on our planet, thanks to their photosynthesis process. Plants capture sunlight and use that source of energy to produce carbohydrates. In this process the plant uses carbon dioxide and produces oxygen. The carbohydrates produced allow plants to grow, thus producing food for other organisms. Therefore plants are very important in feeding the world. The world population is expected to grow to some 9 billion by 2050. That is why food production and food distribution need to be very much improved. Scientists all over the globe are now trying to further improve the photosynthesis process in order to increase food production. For that improvement finding limiting factors is a crucial step. When scientists and plant breeders will be able to eliminate one or more of these limiting factors, it may get feasible to develop crop plants that grow faster and produce more food. Elias Kaiser studied factors that limit photosynthesis under fluctuating light conditions. In the field and in greenhouses irradiance incident on leaves often fluctuates, due to the movement of leaves, clouds and the sun. Plants need to respond to these fluctuations by adapting biochemical processes in their leaves. These adaptations take time. Kaiser wanted to know whether it would be possible to shorten the adaptation period. That could enable plants to use the sunlight more efficiently. Several potentially important limiting factors were chosen by Kaiser. He studied tomato and Arabdiposis thaliana plants and combined his laboratory research with the use of computer models that describe and predict photosynthesis. Kaiser:  The concentration and composition of Rubisco activase are potentially attractive factors to improve the pace with which plants can adapt their photosynthesis during fluctuating light conditions. Differences in the Rubisco activase concentration and form, result in different capacities to quickly adapt to increased light. I expect that species with higher Rubisco activase concentrations and altered composition or three dimensional shape can be made available in crops. That makes it worthwhile to choose for this approach to further improve photosynthesis. ","Published: February 15, 2016"

Additionally, they showed how a version of the gene with edited RNA prevents metastasis.  If breast cancer is caught in its earliest stages, all patients who are treated successfully are alive five years after treatment, according to the National Cancer Institute. However, when breast cancer metastasizes, or spreads from the breast to other organs, only about one in five patients survive more than five years. This significant gap in survival underscores the need to determine what causes breast cancer to spread. The causes of metastasis in breast cancer at a molecular level are not very well understood, so identifying regulatory genes that prompt this behavior could have a tremendous impact on survival, from early detection to the design of better treatment strategies.  Metastatic breast cancer is ultimately what kills patients,  said Qihong Huang, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor in the Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis Program at The Wistar Institute and lead author of the study.  While early detection is critical, it does not help patients whose disease has spread, and so we wanted to determine what was causing this to happen.  The researchers analized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified 41 genes inversely correlated with survival in breast cancer. Huang and colleagues focused on one gene in particular: GABAA receptor alpha3 (Gabra3). The gene was particularly intriguing, since prior to this study, researchers believed that Gabra3 was only found in brain tissue. There were three main reasons the researchers determined it was worth studying. First, it s highly expressed in cancer tissues, but not in healthy breast tissues. Second, it s a cell surface molecule and therefore something that could be potentially targeted by a drug. Finally, drugs that target Gabra3 are already available for treating other diseases like insomnia. The researchers showed that cells expressing Gabra3 were better at migrating and invading than their control counterparts, and Gabra3 showed metastasis-promoting activity in vivo, and animal models injected with the activated gene all developed metastatic lesions in their lungs. It does so by activating the AKT pathway, a cellular pathway essential to cell growth and survival in many types of cancer including breast cancer. In some instances, though, certain types of Gabra3 are actually able to suppress breast cancer metastasis. This is closely linked to the RNA of the gene. RNA is a type of molecule similar to the DNA that encodes our genes, and recent discoveries have shown that RNA has a complex role in regulating how genes are turned on or off. In a phenomenon known as  RNA editing,  small changes can be made to RNA nucleotide sequences even after they ve been generated. Huang and colleagues found that Gabra3 that had undergone RNA editing was found only in non-invasive breast cancers. When the RNA is edited, it suppressed the activation of the AKT pathway required for metastasis, meaning that breast cancer with this specific type of Gabra3 was unable to spread to other organs. This is particularly encouraging since signaling proteins called interferons can increase RNA editing activity and could therefore prevent Gabra3 from activating the AKT pathway.  We believe this is the first time that anyone has demonstrated the importance of RNA editing in breast cancer,  Huang said.  A combination strategy that that involves targeting Gabra3 while also upregulating the expression of RNA editing molecules could be an effective strategy for managing metastatic breast cancer.  In addition to further studying the role of Gabra3 in breast cancer metastasis, Wistar is actively seeking collaborative development partners to advance the targeted use of existing GABA-A receptor antagonists in Gabra3 overexpressing tumors. Furthermore, Wistar is interested in collaborations to develop blood-brain barrier impermeable GABA-A receptor antagonists as next generation oncology therapeutics.","Published: February 15, 2016"

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic condition that affects millions of people around the world. Although its cause isn't completely understood, research suggests that bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract play an important part. People with the condition experience repeated inflammation of the large intestine's lining, which can cause ulcers, abdominal pain, diarrhea and other symptoms. At least one recent study suggested that vinegar, which has been used in traditional medicine for centuries, might be effective against ulcerative colitis. Lu Yu, Bo Liu and colleagues wanted to further investigate this possibility. The researchers tested vinegar and its main ingredient, acetic acid, in a mouse model of ulcerative colitis. Giving the mice either substance by adding it in small amounts to their drinking water significantly reduced symptoms of the condition. An analysis of mouse stool samples showed that treated animals had higher levels of bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria. Other studies have found these bacteria to be beneficial to mice with colitis-like symptoms. Treatment also lowered the levels of proteins that induce potentially damaging inflammation in the gut. The researchers say further work would be needed to determine vinegar's effects on ulcerative colitis in humans.","Published: February 15, 2016"

Hall, Ph.D., assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Wake Forest Baptist and lead author of the study.  Although we are certainly at the early stages of the technology, eventually we could perform the test using a few drops of blood from a simple finger prick.  Nucleic acids consist of chains or sequences of bases stretching from just a few to millions of elements long. The exact order in which these bases are found, even over short distances, is strongly tied to their functions, and therefore can be used as direct indicators of what is going on inside cells and tissue. For example, one family of these nucleic acids known as microRNAs are only about 20 bases long, but can signal a wide range of diseases, including cancer.  Scientists have studied microRNA biomarkers for years, but one problem has been accurate detection because they are so short, many technologies have real difficulty identifying them,  Hall said.  In the new technique, nanotechnology is used to determine whether a specific target nucleic acid sequence exists within a mixture, and to quantify it if it does through a simple electronic signature.  If the sequence you are looking for is there, it forms a double helix with a probe we provide and you see a clear signal. If the sequence isn t there, then there isn t any signal,  Hall said.  By simply counting the number of signals, you can determine how much of the target is around.  In this study, the team first demonstrated that the technology could effectively identify a specific sequence among a background of competing nucleic acids, and then applied their technique to one particular microRNA (mi-R155) known to indicate lung cancer in humans. They showed that the approach could resolve the minute amount of microRNAs that can be found in patients. Next steps will involve expanding the technology to study clinical samples of blood, tissue or urine. Hall holds a provisional patent on this technology.","Published: February 15, 2016"

Type 1 diabetes is the autoimmune form of diabetes, in which insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed by immune cells, especially those known as T cells. Insulin is the hormone that regulates levels of glucose in the blood and without insulin, a life-threatening disease results. Currently, there is no cure for type 1 diabetes.  Our lab studies the type of T cell known as a CD4 T cell,  said Kathryn Haskins, PhD, professor of immunology and microbiology and corresponding author of the article.  We have focused on autoreactive CD4 T cells using a mouse model of autoimmune diabetes. We have been especially interested in identifying the antigens that activate these T cells.  Antigens for T cells are pieces of proteins, or protein fragments (peptides) that have to be taken up and presented to the T cells by antigen-presenting cells. Normally, a CD4 T cell is supposed to respond to  foreign  antigens, like a viral peptide. But in autoimmune disease the autoreactive CD4 T cells respond to peptides that are generated in the body. Such peptides are called autoantigens. When an autoreactive T cell sees its antigen, it becomes activated and can initiate disease. By identifying those antigens, scientists may be able to use that information to detect autoreactive T cells early in disease, or better yet, in at-risk individuals. If they are able to use the antigens to turn off destructive T cells, they may be able to prevent the disease. Haskins and others, including fellow corresponding author Thomas Delong, PhD, asst. professor of immunology and microbiology, conducted experiments to analyze the fractions of beta cells that contain antigen for autoreactive CD4 T cells in order to identify autoantigens in type 1 diabetes. They discovered a new class of antigens that consist of insulin fragments fused to peptides of other proteins present in beta cells. That fusion leads to generation of hybrid insulin peptides that are not encoded in an individual s genome.  If peptides in the body are modified from their original form, they essentially become  foreign  to the immune system and this may explain why they become targets for the autoreactive T cells. The discovery of hybrid peptides as targets of the immune system provides a plausible explanation of how the immune system is tricked into destroying the body s own beta cells. The discovery may also lead to a better understanding of other autoimmune diseases.","Published: February 15, 2016"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/origin-of-a-species-204530,Origin of a Species A study by researchers at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at Oxford University has uncovered the key role played by a single gene in how groups of animals diverge to form new species   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The study restored fertility to the normally-infertile offspring of two subspecies of mice, by replacing part of the Prdm9 gene with the equivalent human version. Despite the nearly 150 million years of evolution separating mice and humans, these 'humanized' mice were completely fertile. New animal species form when groups of animals become isolated and as a result, begin to separate through evolution (a process known as speciation). When these isolated populations meet later, they might be able to breed with each other, but the male offspring are often infertile. Horses and donkeys are an example of such speciation: they can interbreed, but their offspring, mules, are infertile. 'Our work studied similar infertility in hybrid house mice, whose two parents come from different subspecies found in Western and Eastern Europe', says Dr Ben Davies from the Nuffield Department of Medicine, the first author on the study. These two sub-species are therefore on the verge of splitting into two entirely different species, since like mules, their offspring are infertile. Dr Davies and his colleagues studied the Prdm9  gene: this gene is already known to have a role in infertility in mice from different species, and  is in fact the only known speciation gene in mammals. However, how speciation might link up to infertility was unknown. A previous clue came from earlier work by Professor Simon Myers and Professor Peter Donnelly, the two senior authors on this study. Their work had found that the protein produced by the Prdm9 gene determines where in the genome maternal and paternal chromosomes exchange genetic information: a process known as recombination, which controls how genes are passed down through a species. To figure out the exact involvement of the gene in how species form, the transgenic, chromosome dynamics and the genomics core facilities at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics came together to carry out a new study. The groups replaced the region of the mouse Prdm9 gene responsible for DNA binding with the equivalent sequence from humans, thus completely changing where recombination happened along the genome. 'The effect of this change was startling', says Professor Myers. 'When these humanized mice were crossed with mice from the other subspecies, the offspring were no longer infertile but were instead fully fertile: inserting a key part of the human version of the gene into the mouse DNA binding domain had completely reversed the infertility of hybrid mice.' Speciation thus seems to be a potentially reversible event, at least in mice, where the human allele mimics what may happen when a random Prdm9 mutation occurs. Only the binding properties of PRDM9 protein were changed in the experiment, so the researchers also investigated PRDM9 binding to DNA in more detail. They found that the infertile mouse hybrids showed a striking pattern: the mouse PRDM9 protein would bind to one of their chromosomes or the other, but not both. This happened even though the two copies of each chromosome they carry   one from each subspecies   are more than 98% similar overall. The researchers discovered that this strange binding pattern came about because over many generations, the normal mouse PRDM9 protein erodes the DNA sequence it binds to, resulting in the asymmetric chromosome binding pattern seen in the infertile hybrids. The researchers think that asymmetric binding makes it more difficult for chromosomes to successfully identify and make contact with each other as egg and sperm cells are formed. The result is that in many different hybrid mice, asymmetric PRDM9 binding is associated with an increasing failure rate in chromosomes making contact correctly, leading to more and more fertility problems.  'We think that the symmetric marking of chromosomes by PRDM9 facilitates their pairing: where PRDM9 binding is very asymmetric, this leads to difficulties in pairing, failure in recombination repair and, at one extreme, the infertility we see in some  mouse hybrids', says Professor Donnelly. 'These results also highlight just how important it is to understand the co-evolution of the Prdm9 gene with the whole genome in which it resides: we now have a new mechanism for reproductive isolation of closely related subspecies.' The research team are now busy re-engineering different version of the Prdm9 gene to explore further, and they hope to find out how exactly the symmetry of DNA binding can influence the pairing of chromosomes.","Published: February 15, 2016"

Even though it is hard to diagnose, Lyme disease is still the most common vector-borne illness in the United States, with 30,000 cases reported each year to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With more accurate tests, experts say, the number of people infected could turn out to be 10 times higher. ""Improved diagnostics are urgently needed for Lyme disease,"" said Charles Chiu, MD, PhD, an associate professor of laboratory medicine at UCSF and lead investigator for the study, published Feb. 12 in mBio. ""The tick that transmits Lyme also harbors many other pathogens, and early diagnosis is critical in guiding appropriate treatment and preventing later complications of the illness."" Most people who contract the disease recover quickly with antibiotic treatment, but between 10 and 20 percent report persistent symptoms. Lyme disease has also been associated with arthritis, meningitis, facial palsy and in rare cases myocarditis, or damage to the heart muscle, leading to sudden death. In an effort to find better ways of diagnosing the disease, and discovering molecular pathways that might explain how Lyme disease could cause long-term symptoms, researchers used a next-generation sequencing technique, called RNA-seq, to investigate the transcriptome   the genes that are being turned on   in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Researchers examined 29 patients before and after they received a three-week course of antibiotic treatment and also six months later. Compared to patients with other active bacterial or viral infections, the Lyme disease patients had distinctive gene signatures that persisted for at least three weeks, even after they had taken the antibiotics. Some differences in the transcriptome lingered for six months. ""To our knowledge, this study is the first to document changes in gene expression occurring even after a bacterial infection has been treated with appropriate antibiotics,"" said John Aucott, MD, assistant professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a senior investigator on the study. Six months after treatment, 15 of the 29 patients in the study had fully recovered, while 13 had persistent symptoms, and one had dropped out. Despite the stark differences in how the patients reported feeling, the researchers could not detect transcriptional differences between the two groups. They said larger studies are needed to confirm this finding. Researchers found similarities between the transcriptional changes after Lyme disease infection and other diseases. The acute phase of Lyme disease infection had similarities with influenza. At six months, the gene signatures of Lyme disease patients showed some similarities to those from patients with immune diseases like systematic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic fatigue syndrome. The researchers said measureable and persistent changes to the transcriptome may also be characteristic of a number of other infections, such as chronic hepatitis C.

Described in the American Chemical Society Synthetic Biology journal, the team describes using protein polymers known as ""R bodies"", which are found in certain bacteria, as retractable nanoneedles that can extend to puncture cellular membranes and release molecules on command. In this time-lapse, retractable protein actuators  called ""R bodies"" - found naturally in certain bacteria - are seen extending from barely-visible tiny coils into long pointy tubes that are capable of rupturing cell membranes. The extension is triggered by a rise in pH level. Wyss Institute researchers have harnessed these structures and are adapting them for use in mammalian cells, which could one day lead to novel mechanisms for delivering drugs and other chemicals of interest. Credit: Wyss Institute at Harvard University. ""This is one of nature's innovations, but the discovery here is our ability to translate this from nature into a system that we can now engineer and control,"" said Wyss Core Faculty member Pamela Silver, Ph.D., who is also Professor of Biochemistry and Systems Biology at HMS, and senior author on the study. Functioning like a biological actuator, R bodies respond to pH levels to extend from a tightly bound coil to a long, thin structure akin to a nanoscale needle or javelin. In nature, the bacteria containing R bodies are shed by a ""killer strain"" of single-celled organisms called paramecia. When a paramecium of a different strain ingests these shed bacteria containing R bodies, a difference in pH level between the two strains causes the R bodies to extend and puncture the bacteria's cell walls, releasing toxins that kill the host paramecium. But in synthetic biology, R bodies now represent a whole new way of controlling delivery of beneficial molecules such as biologic therapies, pharmaceutical drugs or other payloads to specific cells. ""Our research establishes R bodies as biological machines that we can use to break through membranes,"" said Jessica Polka, Ph.D., a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Wyss Institute and HMS, who was first author on the study. ""These actuators don't consume molecular fuel and are extremely robust; we believe they could one day be used to deliver material to mammalian cells."" Importantly, R bodies present a physical rather than genetic strategy for manipulating cells. At high pH levels, R bodies resemble a coil of ribbon. But at lower pH levels, they undergo a conformational change converting them into pointy hollow tubes capable of puncturing through membranes, breaking that barrier and releasing any cargo contained inside. By modifying the pH level that triggers this response, R bodies become a tunable platform for controlling release of toxins or therapies.  R bodies are pictured in their two different states, contracted and extended, in this microscopic image. Tightly bound in a small coil in lower pH, R bodies extend into sharp tubular structures akin to javelins when pH levels rise, puncturing the membranes of the cells housing them. By tuning R bodies to respond to specific pH levels, they present a new mechanical platform for precisely controlling release of molecules with many potential applications in biotechnology and medicine. Credit: Wyss Institute at Harvard University. ""These R bodies also can be thought of as scaffolds for new biomaterials,"" said Silver. ""By decorating these polymers with different kinds of metals or other materials with properties of interest, we could potentially develop a range of actuator-like, nanoscale structures."" What's also unique about R bodies is their reversibility. Although they extend in low pH, they retract back into a tight coil when the pH level rises. In biological systems, reversibility is not a common property but is of much interest to synthetic biologists like Polka and Silver. Since bacterial and eukaryotic cells all contain compartmentalized membranes, a reversible system for breaking barriers establishes a mechanical strategy for precisely controlling cells. This advance could potentially lead to a range of applications in biotechnology and medicine such as creation of new programmable biomaterials, drug delivery, and ecosystem management. ""There are so many amazing mechanisms engineered by Nature, and this is a great example of how we can mine living systems for unique biological elements and adapt them to develop programmable technologies for high value applications using synthetic biology,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at HMS and the Vascular Biology Program at Children's Hospital and Professor of Engineering at the Harvard John A.

No cure exists for these diseases. Ten percent of ALS patients suffer from a familial form of the disease, while FTD is caused in 40 percent of patients by a genetic defect. In 2011, the most important genetic cause of ALS and FTD was discovered. The causative mutation was a repetition of a piece of non-coding DNA, a so called tandem repeat, in a gene with an unknown function, named C9orf72. A team of scientists from VIB (Flanders Institute for Biotechnology) and the University of Leuven (KU Leuven) has now discovered that proteins translated from this tandem repeat interfere with the nucleocytoplasmic transport which they found is essential for causing ALS and FTD. See Also: Researchers develop strategy to combat genetic ALS, FTD ""This is the first time that we see a role for nucleocytoplasmic transport for these specific forms of ALS and FTD. Moreover, these insights have a solid basis, since they come from 4 different scientific angles. It is an important next step in our understanding of these terrible diseases,"" said Prof. Ludo Van Den Bosch (VIB/KU Leuven). In ALS, motor neurons in the motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord are affected, while in FTD cortical neurons in the frontotemporal cortex of the brain degenerate. Patients can have a clinical presentation that is predominantly motor (ALS), predominantly frontotemporal (FTD), or a mixture of both (ALS-FTD). The motor problems consist of muscle weakness and paralysis, which is progressive and is usually fatal within 3 to 5 years after onset of the disease. FTD patients show behavioral and/or personality changes or language problems. The causative tandem repeat in the gene C9orf72 is a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion which could lead to a decrease in the C9orf72 protein level. Moreover, the repeat-containing RNA could be toxic, eventually by sequestering RNA-binding proteins in the nucleus. Last but not least, the so-called dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) translated from these repeat-containing RNA could also cause toxicity. These DPRs are translated by an unconventional non-ATG mediated form of translation from the hexanucleotide repeats in all three reading frames. As this process can also occur from the antisense transcript, a total of five different DPRs are found in C9orf72 patients. PhD student Steven Boeynaems and Dr. Elke Bogaert under direction of Prof. Ludo Van Den Bosch and Prof. Wim Robberecht (VIB/KU Leuven) investigated whether and how these different DPRs could be toxic. Therefore, the researchers designed expression constructs that only express one DPR. Using yeast and fruit fly models, they discovered that only two of these DPRs were toxic, namely the glycine-arginine and proline-arginine DPRs. Learn More: Scientists create mice with a major genetic cause of ALS and frontotemporal dementia The scientists next investigated how these DPRs were toxic using genetic tools available in yeast and fruit fly. In collaboration with Dr. A. Gitler (Stanford University), genome-wide genetic modifier screens were first performed in yeast. These screens were strongly enriched for genes controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport. Using the fruit fly, the researchers confirmed the importance of this process. The most potent modifier was the import factor, transportin-1. This protein normally transports many RNA-binding proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This process was altered in the transgenic fruit flies as these showed cytoplasmic accumulation of RNA-binding proteins. Moreover, they found that in brains of C9orf72 patients transportin-1 cargoes were also mislocalized. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that glycine-arginine and proline-arginine repeats could mimic the nuclear localization signals of these proteins and hence hijack nuclear import by overloading the nucleocytoplasmic transport system. ""Recently, two other papers were published in Nature using fruit flies containing C9orf72 repeats, yielding both toxic repeat RNA and toxic DPRs and these also concluded that defective nucleocytoplasmic transport is important in C9orf72 ALS and/or FTD,"" said Robberecht. ""Interestingly, most patients with ALS and/or FTD, including the ones with C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeats, have aberrant cytoplasmic aggregates of normally nuclear RNA-binding proteins. As a consequence, modulating nucleocytoplasmic transport could become a promising and new therapeutic avenue."" VIB (the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology)  press release Jovicic A et al.

The stem cell gene therapy could be applicable for 60 percent of people with Duchenne, which affects approximately 1 in 5,000 boys in the US and is the most common fatal childhood genetic disease. The approach uses a technology called CRISPR/Cas9 to correct genetic mutations that cause the disease. The study, which was led by co-senior authors April Pyle and Melissa Spencer and first author Courtney Young, was published in the journal Cell Stem Cell. See Also: Gene-editing technique successfully stops progression of Duchenne muscular dystrophy ""This method is likely 10 years away from being tested in people,"" said Spencer, professor of neurology in the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, co-director of the Center for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy at UCLA and member of the Broad Stem Cell Research Center ""It is important that we take all the necessary steps to maximize safety while quickly bringing a therapeutic treatment to patients in clinical trials."" Duchenne typically occurs through one mutation in a gene called dystrophin, which makes a protein with the same name. In people without the disease, the dystrophin protein helps strengthen and connect muscle fibers and cells. There are hundreds of mutations in the dystrophin gene that can lead to the disease, but in 60 percent of people with Duchenne, their mutation will occur within a specific hot spot of the gene. Duchenne mutations cause abnormally low production of the dystrophin protein, which in turn causes muscles to degenerate and become progressively weaker. Symptoms usually begin in early childhood; patients gradually lose mobility and typically die from heart or respiratory failure around age 20. Some current medications can treat the disease's symptoms but none can stop the progression of the disease or significantly improve patients' quality of life -- and there is currently no way to reverse or cure the disease. The platform developed by the UCLA researchers focuses on the hot spot of the dystrophin gene. To test the platform, they obtained skin cells from consenting patients at the Center for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, all of whom had mutations that fell within the dystrophin gene hot spot. The researchers reprogrammed the cells to create induced pluripotent stem cells in an FDA-compliant facility at the Broad Stem Cell Research Center; the use of this facility is an important step in the process as preclinical research moves toward human clinical trials. Induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells, have the ability to become any type of human cell while also maintaining the genetic code from the person they originated from. Next, the scientists removed the Duchenne mutations in the iPS cells using a gene editing platform they developed that uses the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. (CRISPR stands for ""clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats."") The platform targets and removes specific regions of the hot spot of the dystrophin gene, which harbors 60 percent of Duchenne mutations, which restores the missing protein. CRISPR/Cas9 is a naturally occurring reaction that bacteria use to fight viruses. In 2012, scientists discovered they could adapt the process to make cuts in specific human DNA sequences. One part of the CRISPR/Cas9 system acts like a navigation system and can be programmed to seek out a specific part of the genetic code -- a mutation, for example. The second part of the system can cut mutations out of the genetic code, and in some cases can replace the mutation with a normal genetic sequence. Once the UCLA researchers had produced iPS cells that were free from Duchenne mutations, they differentiated the iPS cells into cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle cells and then transplanted the skeletal muscle cells into mice that had a genetic mutation in the dystrophin gene. They found that the transplanted muscle cells successfully produced the human dystrophin protein. The result was the largest deletion ever observed in the dystrophin gene using CRISPR/Cas9, and the study was the first to create corrected human iPS cells that could directly restore functional muscle tissue affected by Duchenne. (Previously, scientists had used CRISPR/Cas9 to repair mutations that affect smaller numbers of people with Duchenne, and in cell types that weren't necessarily clinically relevant). Learh More: Discovery of New Form of Dystrophin Protein Could Lead to Therapy for Some Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Patients ""This work demonstrates the feasibility of using a single gene editing platform, plus the regenerative power of stem cells to correct genetic mutations and restore dystrophin production for 60 percent of Duchenne patients,"" said Pyle, associate professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics and member of the Broad Stem Cell Research Center. Young, a UCLA predoctoral fellow and president of a UCLA student group called Bruin Allies for Duchenne, is particularly passionate about Duchenne research because she has a cousin with the disease. ""I already knew I was interested in science, so after my cousin's diagnosis, I decided to dedicate my career to finding a cure for Duchenne,"" Young said. ""It makes everything a lot more meaningful, knowing that I'm doing something to help all the boys who will come after my cousin. I feel like I'm contributing and I'm excited because the field of Duchenne research is advancing in a really positive direction."" Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common and severe of the 30 forms of muscular dystrophy. The UCLA researchers plan to develop strategies to test the Duchenne-specific CRISPR/Cas9 platform to treat the disease in animals as the next step toward perfecting a method that can be used in humans. The CRISPR/Cas9 platform for Duchenne developed by the UCLA scientists is not yet available in clinical trials and has not been approved by the FDA for use in humans.

This deeply ingrained instinct helps us to survive; it's much easier to find food, shelter, and other necessities with a group than alone. Deprived of human contact, most people become lonely and emotionally distressed. In a study which appears in the journal Cell, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) neuroscientists have identified a brain region that represents these feelings of loneliness. This cluster of cells, located near the back of the brain in an area called the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), is necessary for generating the increased sociability that normally occurs after a period of social isolation, the researchers found in a study of mice. See Also: Brain circuits involved in emotion discovered ""To our knowledge, this is the first time anyone has pinned down a loneliness-like state to a cellular substrate. Now we have a starting point for really starting to study this,"" says Kay Tye, the Whitehead Career Development Assistant Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, a member of MIT's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, and one of the senior authors of the study. While much research has been done on how the brain seeks out and responds to rewarding social interactions, very little is known about how isolation and loneliness also motivate social behavior. ""There are many studies from human psychology describing how we have this need for social connection, which is particularly strong in people who feel lonely. But our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying that state is pretty slim at the moment. It certainly seems like a useful, adaptive response, but we don't really know how that's brought about,"" says Gillian Matthews, a postdoc at the Picower Institute and the paper's lead author. Matthews first identified the loneliness neurons somewhat serendipitously, while studying a completely different topic. As a PhD student at Imperial College London, she was investigating how drugs affect the brain, particularly dopamine neurons. She originally planned to study how drug abuse influences the DRN, a brain region that had not been studied very much. As part of the experiment, each mouse was isolated for 24 hours, and Matthews noticed that in the control mice, which had not received any drugs, there was a strengthening of connections in the DRN following the isolation period. Further studies, both at Imperial College London and then in Tye's lab at MIT, revealed that these neurons were responding to the state of isolation. When animals are housed together, DRN neurons are not very active. However, during a period of isolation, these neurons become sensitized to social contact and when the animals are reunited with other mice, DRN activity surges. At the same time, the mice become much more sociable than animals that had not been isolated. When the researchers suppressed DRN neurons using optogenetics, a technique that allows them to control brain activity with light, they found that isolated mice did not show the same rebound in sociability when they were re-introduced to other mice. ""That suggested these neurons are important for the isolation-induced rebound in sociability,"" Tye says. ""When people are isolated for a long time and then they're reunited with other people, they're very excited, there's a surge of social interaction. We think that this adaptive and evolutionarily conserved trait is what we are modeling in mice, and these neurons could play a role in that increased motivation to socialize."" The researchers also found that animals with a higher rank in the social hierarchy were more responsive to changes in DRN activity, suggesting that they may be more susceptible to feelings of loneliness following isolation. Learn More: Researchers switch emotion linked to memory ""The social experience of every animal is not the same in a group,"" Tye says. ""If you're the dominant mouse, maybe you love your social environment. And if you're the subordinate mouse, and you're being beat up every day, maybe it's not so fun. Maybe you feel socially excluded already."" The researchers are now studying whether these neurons actually detect loneliness or are responsible for driving the response to loneliness, and whether they might be part of a larger brain network that responds to social isolation. Another area to be explored is whether differences in these neurons can explain why some people prefer more social contact than others, and whether those differences are innate or formed by experience. ""There's probably some part that could very well be determined by innate brain features, but I think probably an equal, if not greater, contribution would be from the environment in which individuals have developed,"" Tye says. ""These are completely open questions. We can only speculate about it at this point."" Massachusetts Institute of Technology   Original reporting by: Anne Trafton Matthews GA et al.

People with sleep apnea also often report problems with thinking such as poor concentration, difficulty with memory and decision-making, depression, and stress. See Also: Brain damage caused by severe sleep apnea is reversible According to new research from the University of Califorina, Los Angeles (UCLA) School of Nursing, published in the Journal of Sleep Research, people with sleep apnea show significant changes in the levels of two important brain chemicals, which could be a reason that many have symptoms that impact their day-to-day lives. UCLA researchers looked at levels of these neurotransmitters glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid, known as GABA in the brain's insula, which integrates signals from higher brain regions to regulate emotion, thinking and physical functions such as blood pressure and perspiration. They found that people with sleep apnea had decreased levels of GABA and unusually high levels of glutamate. GABA is a chemical messenger that acts as an inhibitor in the brain, which can slow things down and help to keep people calm like a brake pedal. GABA affects mood and helps make endorphins. Glutamate, by contrast, is like an accelerator; when glutamate levels are high, the brain is working in a state of stress, and consequently doesn't function as effectively. High levels of glutamate can also be toxic to nerves and neurons. ""In previous studies, we've seen structural changes in the brain due to sleep apnea, but in this study we actually found substantial differences in these two chemicals that influence how the brain is working,"" said Paul Macey, the lead researcher on the study and an associate professor at the UCLA School of Nursing. Macey said the researchers were taken aback by the differences in the GABA and glutamate levels. ""It is rare to have this size of difference in biological measures,"" Macey said. ""We expected an increase in the glutamate, because it is a chemical that causes damage in high doses and we have already seen brain damage from sleep apnea. What we were surprised to see was the drop in GABA. That made us realize that there must be a reorganization of how the brain is working."" Macey says the study's results are, in a way, encouraging. ""In contrast with damage, if something is working differently, we can potentially fix it."" Learn More: Study provides more evidence that sleep apnea is hurting the brain The link between sleep apnea and changes in the state of the brain is important news for clinicians, Macey said. ""What comes with sleep apnea are these changes in the brain, so in addition to prescribing continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP a machine used to help an individual sleep easier, which is the gold standard treatment for sleep disturbance physicians now know to pay attention to helping their patients who have these other symptoms,"" Macey said. ""Stress, concentration, memory loss these are the things people want fixed."" In future studies, the researchers hope to determine whether treating the sleep apnea using CPAP or other methods returns patients' brain chemicals back to normal levels. If not, they will turn to the question of what treatments could be more effective. They are also studying the impacts of mindfulness exercises to see if they can reduce glutamate levels by calming the brain.

The drug, which is an approved anti-cancer treatment, has been shown to delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease, both in a test tube and in nematode worms. It has previously been suggested that statin-like drugs which are safe and can be taken widely by those at risk of developing disease might be a prospect, but this is the first time that a potential 'neurostatin' has been reported. See Also: Mesh-like scaffold is disordered in Alzheimer's-affected cells When the drug was given to nematode worms genetically programmed to develop Alzheimer's disease, it had no effect once symptoms had already appeared. But when the drug was given to the worms before any symptoms became apparent, no evidence of the condition appeared, raising the possibility that this drug, or other molecules like it, could be used to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The results are reported in the journal Science Advances. By analyzing the way the drug, called bexarotene, works at the molecular level, the international team of researchers, from the University of Cambridge, Lund University and the University of Groningen, found that it stops the first step in the molecular cascade that leads to the death of brain cells. This step, called primary nucleation, occurs when naturally occurring proteins in the body fold into the wrong shape and stick together with other proteins, eventually forming thin filament-like structures called amyloid fibrils. This process also creates smaller clusters called oligomers, which are highly toxic to nerve cells and are thought to be responsible for brain damage in Alzheimer's disease. ""The body has a variety of natural defences to protect itself against neurodegeneration, but as we age, these defences become progressively impaired and can get overwhelmed,"" said Professor Michele Vendruscolo of Cambridge's Department of Chemistry, the paper's senior author. ""By understanding how these natural defences work, we might be able to support them by designing drugs that behave in similar ways."" For the past two decades, researchers have attempted to develop treatments for Alzheimer's that could stop the aggregation and proliferation of oligomers. However, these attempts have all failed, in part because there was not a precise knowledge of the mechanics of the disease's development: Vendruscolo and his colleagues have been working to understand exactly that. Using a test developed by study co-author Professor Tuomas Knowles, also from the Department of Chemistry, and by Professor Sara Linse, from Lund University, the researchers were able to determine what happens during each stage of the disease's development, and also what might happen if one of those stages was somehow switched off. ""In order to block protein aggregation, we need accurate understanding of exactly what is happening and when,"" said Vendruscolo. ""The test that we have developed not only measures the rates of the process as a whole, but also the rates of its specific component sub-processes, so that we can reduce the toxicity of the aggregates rather than simply stopping them forming."" Johnny Habchi, the first author of the paper, and colleagues assembled a library of more than 10,000 small molecules which interact in some way with amyloid-beta, a molecule that plays a vital role in Alzheimer's disease. Using the test developed by Knowles and Linse, the researchers first analyzed molecules that were either drugs already approved for some other purpose, or drugs developed for Alzheimer's disease or other similar conditions which had failed clinical trials. Learn More: Engineering self-assembling amyloid fibers The first successful molecule they identified was bexarotene, which is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of lymphoma. ""One of the real steps forward was to take a molecule that we thought could be a potential drug and work out exactly what it does. In this case, what it does is suppress primary nucleation, which is the aim for any neurostatin-type molecule,"" said Vendruscolo. ""If you stop the process before aggregation has started, you can't get proliferation."" One of the key advances of the current work is that by understanding the mechanisms of how Alzheimer's disease develops in the brain, the researchers were able to target bexarotene to the correct point in the process. ""Even if you have an effective molecule, if you target the wrong step in the process, you can actually make things worse by causing toxic protein assemblies to build up elsewhere,"" said study co-author Professor Chris Dobson, Master of St John's College, University of Cambridge. ""It's like traffic control - if you close a road to try to reduce jams, you can actually make the situation worse if you put the block in the wrong place. It is not necessarily the case that all the molecules in earlier drug trials were ineffective, but it may be that in some cases the timing of the delivery was wrong."" Earlier studies of bexarotene had suggested that the drug could actually reverse Alzheimer's symptoms by clearing amyloid-beta aggregates in the brain, which received a great deal of attention. However, the earlier results, which were later called into question, were based on a completely different mode of action - the clearance of aggregates - than the one reported in the current study. By exploiting their novel approach, which enables them to carry out highly quantitative analysis of the aggregation process, the researchers have now shown that compounds such as bexarotene could instead be developed as preventive drugs, because its primary action is to inhibit the crucial first step in the aggregation of amyloid-beta. ""We know that the accumulation of amyloid is a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's and that drugs to halt this build-up could help protect nerve cells from damage and death,"" said Dr Rosa Sancho, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK. ""A recent clinical trial of bexarotene in people with Alzheimer's was not successful, but this new work in worms suggests the drug may need to be given very early in the disease. We will now need to see whether this new preventative approach could halt the earliest biological events in Alzheimer's and keep damage at bay in in further animal and human studies."" Over the next 35 years, the number of people with Alzheimer's disease is predicted to go from 40 million to 130 million, with 70% of those in middle or low-income countries. ""The only way of realistically stopping this dramatic rise is through preventive measures: treating Alzheimer's disease only after symptoms have already developed could overwhelm healthcare systems around the world."" Don't Miss: Know your enemy: Oligomers' role in the development of Parkinson's The body has a number of natural defences designed to keep proteins in check. But as we get older, these processes can become impaired and get overwhelmed, and some proteins can slip through the safety net, resulting in Alzheimer's disease and other protein misfolding conditions. While neurostatins are not a cure for Alzheimer's disease, the researchers say that they could reduce its risk by acting as a backup for the body's natural defences against misfolding proteins. ""You wouldn't give statins to someone who had just had a heart attack, and we doubt that giving a neurostatin to an Alzheimer's patient who could no longer recognise a family member would be very helpful,"" said Dobson. ""But if it reduces the risk of the initial step in the process, then it has a serious prospect of being an effective preventive treatment."" But is there hope for those already affected by the disease? The methods that have led to the present advance have enabled the researchers to identify compounds that, rather than preventing the disease, could slow down its progression even when symptoms have become evident. ""The next target of our research is also to be able to treat victims of this dreadful disease,"" said Vendruscolo. University of Cambridge  press release Habchi J et al.

Our brains prioritize rewarding memories over others, and reinforce them by replaying them when we are at rest, according to new research from the University of California (UC), Davis, Center for Neuroscience, published in the journal Neuron.  Rewards help you remember things, because you want future rewards,  said Professor Charan Ranganath, a UC Davis neuroscientist and senior author on the paper.  The brain prioritizes memories that are going to be useful for future decisions.  See Also: Working memory: underlying processes are more complex than we thought It s estimated that we only retain detailed memories for a small proportion of the events of each day, Ranganath said. People with very detailed memories become overwhelmed with information. So if the brain is going to filter information and decide what to remember, it makes sense to save those memories that might be most important for obtaining rewards in the future. Ranganath and postdoctoral researcher Matthias Gruber put this to the test by scanning the brains of volunteers by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as they answered simple yes-no questions on short series of objects for example,  do these objects weigh more than a basketball?  Each series of objects was shown on a background image for context, and depending on the context, the volunteers were told they would either get a large (dollars) or small (cents) reward for giving correct answers. At the end of a series, participants were told how much money they just won. Once participants completed this part of the experiment, the volunteers were scanned during a resting period. Afterward, outside of the scanner, there was a surprise memory test for all objects that were shown during scanning. Although participants were not expecting the memory test outside the scanner, they were better at remembering objects that were associated with a high reward, said Gruber, first author of the paper.  Also, when an object was associated with high reward, people remembered better the particular background scene that was on the screen during scanning, Gruber said. Even more interesting, participants  memory performance was predicted by brain activity measured during rest. When the researchers looked at brain scans of subjects at rest after giving yes-no answers neither learning nor actively recalling the memory they found the same pattern of activity as when subjects were doing the high-reward task. The subjects were apparently replaying the rewarding memories, strengthening connections and helping to fix the memory in place. Learn More: Subtle but important memory function affected by preterm birth People who showed more replay of high-reward memories showed better retention of these events during the post-scan test, as well as increased interactions between the hippocampus, a structure deep in the brain heavily involved in memory, and an area called the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area complex, which is involved in reward processing, suggesting that reward played a role in stimulating the hippocampus after learning. Although this study did not measure it directly, these interactions were likely related to release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is released in the brain when we expect rewards. Conditions such as Parkinson s disease or aging are linked to reduced dopamine and often involve memory defects. The results show how memory could be biased toward the high points of experience, Ranganath said.  It speaks to a memory process that is normally hidden from us,  Ranganath said.

The researchers say that the creation of these ""mini-brains,"" which will be discussed at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in Washington, DC, USA, on Feb. 12 at a press briefing and in a session on Feb. 13, could dramatically change how new drugs are tested for effectiveness and safety, taking the place of the hundreds of thousands of animals used for neurological scientific research in the United States. Performing research using these three-dimensional ""mini-brains"" balls of brain cells that grow and form brain-like structures on their own over the course of eight weeks should be superior to studying mice and rats because they are derived from human cells instead of rodents, they say. See Also: Stem cells from teeth can make brain-like cells ""Ninety-five percent of drugs that look promising when tested in animal models fail once they are tested in humans at great expense of time and money,"" says study leader Thomas Hartung, MD, PhD, the Doerenkamp-Zbinden Professor and Chair for Evidence-based Toxicology at the Bloomberg School. ""While rodent models have been useful, we are not 150-pound rats. And even though we are not balls of cells either, you can often get much better information from these balls of cells than from rodents. ""We believe that the future of brain research will include less reliance on animals, more reliance on human, cell-based models."" Hartung and his colleagues created the brains using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These are adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to an embryonic stem cell-like state and then are stimulated to grow into brain cells. Cells from the skin of several healthy adults were used to create the mini-brains, but Hartung says that cells from people with certain genetic traits or certain diseases can be used to create brains to study various types of pharmaceuticals. He says the brains can be used to study Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and even autism. Projects to study viral infections, trauma and stroke have been started. Hartung's mini-brains are very small at 350 micrometers in diameter, or about the size of the eye of a housefly, they are just visible to the human eye and hundreds to thousands of exact copies can be produced in each batch. One hundred of them can grow easily in the same petri dish in the lab. After cultivating the mini-brains for about two months, the brains developed four types of neurons and two types of support cells: astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, the latter of which go on to create myelin, which insulates the neuron's axons and allows them to communicate faster. The researchers could watch the myelin developing and could see it begin to sheath the axons. The brains even showed spontaneous electrophysiological activity, which could be recorded with electrodes, similar to an electroencephalogram, (EEG). To test them, the researchers placed a mini-brain on an array of electrodes and listened to the spontaneous electrical communication of the neurons as test drugs were added.

In older men and women, ADNP expression in the blood is correlated with cognition and further altered in Alzheimer's disease. While the three-to-one ratio of autism in boys to girls is well known, as is the greater number of female Alzheimer's patients than male Alzheimer's patients, the reasons for these phenomena and the theory that men and women may have different brain constitutions remain in hot dispute. New research from Tel Aviv University (TAU) highlights the neuroprotective potential of SKIP, a four-amino-acid peptide ADNP-replacement therapy developed at the university, and the marked difference in the nerve cell communication in male and female mice. If researchers come to understand how ADNP an activity-related neuroprotective protein that is a major regulatory gene acts differently in males and females, drugs for potential therapeutics can be optimized to treat both autism and Alzheimer's disease. See Also: Research discovers neuroprotective protein in blood is biomarker of Alzheimer's disease The research was led by Prof. Illana Gozes, the incumbent of the Lily and Avraham Gildor Chair for the Investigation of Growth Factors, Head of the Elton Laboratory for Molecular Neuroendocrinology at TAU's Sackler Faculty of Medicine and a member of TAU's Adams Super Center for Brain Studies and the Sagol School of Neuroscience. It was recently published in Molecular Psychiatry. ""We found a clear difference in ADNP's effect on male and female mice,"" Prof. Gozes said. ""The movement of transported material through nerve cells in the brains of the tested mice was slower in males. This information is critical, because it can be used to design more efficient and successful clinical trials for neurological drug candidates, and hopefully develop precise therapies for ADNP-related diseases or conditions with special attention to gender differences."" Prof. Gozes and her team examined the behavioral response of ADNP-deficient and normal male and female mice to different cognitive challenges and social situations. They worked with the Bioinformatics Unit, the NMR Laboratory, the Alfredo Federico Strauss Center for Computational Neuroimaging and Genomic Centers at TAU and the Technion - Institute of Technology to harness state-of-the-art technology that led to the new understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying differences in the male and female mouse brain. Prof. Gozes has been instrumental in drawing attention to the proteins that bind microtubules tubes within nerve cells that maintain cellular shape and serve as ""train tracks"" for movement of biological material through the brain. In this study, Prof. Gozes and her team observed mice in which SKIP was introduced and witnessed accelerated microtubular function in both males and females, using MRI imaging. The pace of neural transport in mice that inhaled magnesium was found to be significantly slower in males. ""The loss of protective proteins exposes cells to physical damage that eventually destroys them,"" said Prof. Gozes, whose previous research on NAP, a snippet of ADNP, has been proven in multiple studies to protect cognitive functioning. ""The new protein-protectant drug candidate SKIP, which is half the size of NAP, was found to increase and repair blocked nerve-cell transport and normalize it."" Male and female reactions were different in social situations, too. ""SKIP was found to normalize mouse reactions in social situations,"" said Prof. Gozes. ""Normal male and female mice behaved very differently: Females were infrequently drawn toward new mice, whereas males were more frequently drawn to new mice. ADNP-deficient male and female mice both preferred the company of familiar mice. After SKIP was introduced, by intranasal administration, we saw that the female and male mice behaved like the ADNP-intact mice. Learn More: Electric current to brain boosts memory ""When clinicians treat patients, they must look at gender,"" Prof. Gozes concluded. ""There may be a gender difference in the way certain nerves behave and the way the nerve cells communicate. ADNP is involved in this process. There are differences between the way men and women react to their environments, and differences at the molecular level may indicate that indeed there are differences between the very way men and women think.""

In their paper published online in the American Journal of Psychiatry, a multi-institutional research team reports that adding treatment with ALKS-5461, a medication that combines two drugs with complementary effects on different opioid receptors, to serotonin-targeting antidepressant therapy produced significant symptom improvement in patients with persistent depression. ALKS-5461 is being developed by Alkermes, Inc., which sponsored the trial. See Also: Genetics in depression: What's known, what's next ""We know that more than half of patients with major depression won't respond to the first antidepressant they try, and almost 40 percent will continue to have symptoms even after switching to or adding different drugs,"" says Maurizio Fava, MD, executive director of the Clinical Trials Network & Institute in the MGH Department of Psychiatry and lead author of the study. ""Opioids have actually been used for centuries to treat mood disorders, and while opioid drugs must be used cautiously because of their potential for abuse, studies have shown that levels of the endogenous opioids released by the central nervous system may be reduced in important brain areas of patients with major depression."" Opioid drugs produce their effects by binding to receptors in the endogenous opioid system, which the body uses to suppress pain and to reward biologically beneficial activities. Two prominent opioid receptors are the mu and kappa receptors, which have overlapping but somewhat different effects. ALKS-5461 is a combination of buprenorphine, which suppresses kappa receptor activity and weakly activates mu receptors, and samidorphan, which blocks mu receptor activity. While buprenorphine is FDA-approved to help treat opioid addiction by easing withdrawal symptoms, samidorphan is an experimental drug being developed by Alkermes for several potential uses. The combination of the two drugs is an effort to balance the opioid system activity while avoiding adverse effects, including the potential for abuse. The current study, a phase 2 clinical trial, enrolled 142 patients with treatment-resistant depression at 31 sites in the U.S. Since depression treatment trials are likely to have a large placebo response, this study used a design developed in 2003 by Fava and David Schoenfeld, PhD, an MGH biostatician, to reduce the impact of the placebo effect. Using this sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD), the trial was conducted in two stages. In stage 1, 98 participants were randomized to receive placebo doses while 43 participants received ALKS-5461 in daily dosages containing either 2 mg or 8 mg of each of the two drugs. After the first four-week treatment period, placebo group members who did not show a response to treatment were re-randomized either to receive one of the two dosages of the active drug or to continue receiving a placebo for stage 2. Fava explains that, by manipulating the expectations of both participants and investigators neither of which knew whether and when an individual was receiving the active drug SPCD minimizes the likelihood of a placebo response, while reducing the need for a much large group of participants. Learn More: Two-drug combo helps older adults with hard-to-treat depression While both dosage levels of ALKS-5461 produced a greater reduction in depression symptoms than did the placebo, as measured by several standard scales, the lower dosage of 2 mg of each drug had effects that were stronger and met statistical significance. Fava notes that it is not unusual for lower doses of psychotropic drugs to be more effective, since higher doses may have more side effects. The most common reported adverse events were nausea, vomiting and dizziness, most of which occurred during the first few days of treatment; and there was no evidence of withdrawal after the treatment period ended or of the likelihood of abuse of ALKS-5461. ""The robust treatment effect seen in this clinical study suggests that many patients with depression may have a dysregulation of the endogenous opioid system, which may be why they do not respond to monoamine-based antidepressants that target the serotonin system,"" says Fava, who is director of the Division of Clinical Research of the MGH Research Institute and the Slater Family Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. ""For the substantial percentage of patients who do not respond to monoamine based medications, this combination may represent an important new approach to the treatment of depression.""

The major study integrated electronic health records data with high resolution maps of common Neanderthal genetic variants found in humans. Vanderbilt University led the study across several institutions, including the University of Washington and Group Health Research Institute.  The project used existing data compiled to look at how genetic variation influences common disease. The paper s first author was Corinne N. Simonti and the senior author was John  Tony  Capra, both at the Vanderbilt Genetic Institute. Capra is from the Vanderbilt Department of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Biological Sciences, and Center for Quantitative Sciences.   Neanderthal DNA variants became part of our genetic heritage from prehistoric contact between ancient species.  After ancestors of modern people left Africa, they encountered and mated with Neanderthals and Denisovans and perhaps other human-like populations in Europe and Asia. Although Neanderthals and Denisovans went extinct, a small fraction of their DNA survives in people.  The genomes of Eurasians can contain between 1.4 percent to 4 percent of DNA inherited from Neanderthals.   We still see the pervasive influence on modern people from interbreeding that happened more than 50,000 years ago,  said Joshua Akey, University of Washington professor of genome sciences. He is a human evolutionary biologist and one of the paper co-authors.  Neanderthal DNA might be a small component of an individual s DNA, but it might make a significant contribution to variation in traits among people.  Some regions of the human genome, such as the gender-linked X chromosome and the arm of chromosome 7, are nearly depleted of Neanderthal DNA.  A few other parts of the human genome, however, are rife with Neanderthal genetic code.  Whether this remnant offered an evolutionary advantage to early humans struggling to adapt to the colder climate, dimmer sunlight, germs and food sources in the Earth s higher latitudes, but later became detrimental under conditions of modern Western life, is under debate. That s because the effects of the mix of Neanderthal and human DNA on people s physical and mental characteristics remains unclear, due to the difficulty and expense of performing association studies. Researchers describe addressing these challenges by combining several powerful data sets. Among these are the genetic and clinical data from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, a national consortium that pools de-identified electronic health records linked and genetic data from nine sites in the United States.  Seattle is one of these sites, jointly led by UW Medicine s Dr. Gail Jarvik, professor of medicine and head of the Division of Medical Genetics at the University of Washington, and Dr. Eric Larson, head of the Group Health Research Institute.  The eMERGE consortium has published over 450 papers to date. Mapping data from the 1000 Genomes Project and the Altai Neanderthal genome were incorporated into the analysis. The study also relied on experts from diverse fields, including physicians, geneticists, evolutionary biologists, anthropologists, epidemiologists, and informatics and computer scientists.  In a museum reconstruction, a Neanderthal girl views her reflection in a pool.  The researchers discovered and re-checked the contributions of common Neanderthal genetic variants to the risk of certain diseases, particularly several neurological, psychiatric, immune system and skin disorders. Taken together, Neanderthal genetic variants explain small amounts of the differences in risk among people for depression and other mood disorders, for a type of skin lesions resulting from sun exposure, for obesity,for acute upper respiratory infections, and for coronary artery disease.  Individual variants were associated with a risk of blood clotting and vessel inflammation problems, with a predilection to tobacco use, to a form of protein-calorie malnutrition and to certain urinary symptoms.  The fact that Neanderthal variation was associated with tobacco predilection is a reminder that the effects of these variants in the present day may not reflect any harm or benefit they had to Neanderthal,  cautions Jarvik.  The Neanderthal did not have tobacco.  These same variants may have benefitted our ancestors,  she said,  rather than harmed them. That may account for their persistence in modern man.  The project s comparison of medical records data with information gleaned from evolutionary genetics was also its limitation.  How Neanderthal DNA influences other sorts of traits not related to disease or clinical findings could not be gleaned. At the same time, Akey said,  Six or seven years ago we couldn t have even contemplated the possibility of looking at the effects of Neanderthal DNA on humans.  It s exciting how quickly the landscape has changed and the remarkable questions science can now ask and answer.  He noted that new research is helping to understand our origins, our biological and geographical history, and why we are what we are today.   Scientists are creating a general framework for excavating ancient DNA from modern day people,  he said.  It s possible we may find new twigs on our human family tree.

Iron is essential for the body to function and has a crucial role in transporting oxygen - low levels cause anaemia which leads to tiredness and lethargy. Iron tablets, which are available over the counter or on prescription, are taken by millions of people in the UK - with six million prescriptions issued each year for iron tablets in England and Wales alone.  In the study the team used human endothelial cells, which line blood vessels, and added a placebo or an iron solution of 10 micromolar (a similar concentration to that seen in the blood after taking an iron tablet).  Through looking at genes used within cells, and then examining the cells in more detail, they found that within ten minutes, cells treated with the iron solution had activated DNA repair systems. These were still activated six hours later. Dr Claire Shovlin, senior author of the study, at the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial, said: ""We already knew that iron could be damaging to cells in very high doses. However, in this study we found that when we applied the kinds of levels of iron you would find in the blood stream after taking an iron tablet, this also seemed to be able to trigger cell damage - at least in the laboratory. In other words, cells seem more sensitive to iron than we previously thought."" Dr Shovlin added: ""This is very early stage research, and we need more work to confirm these findings and investigate what effects this may have on the body. We are still not sure how these laboratory findings translate to blood vessels in the body."" She stressed that prescribed iron supplements are essential for many patients: ""We're not at the stage yet where we would advise doctors to change their approach to prescribing iron supplements. Many people need extra iron - it is crucial to allow our bodies to function properly - and anyone with any concerns about their iron supplements should talk to their healthcare provider.  ""However, this study helps to open the conversation about how much iron people take. At the moment, each standard iron tablet contains almost 10 times the amount of iron men are recommended to eat each day - and these dosages haven't changed for more than 50 years.  This research suggests we may need to think more carefully about how much iron we give to people, and try and tailor the dose to the patient."" The team initially started researching this area after finding that a small proportion of people using iron tablets for the condition hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, which causes abnormalities in the blood vessels, reported their nose bleeds got worse after iron treatment.","Published: February 12, 2016"

Zika virus currently is circulating in about 30 countries and territories (link is external), notably in Latin America and the Caribbean. The virus has been linked to a spike in cases of microcephaly (link is external)  an abnormally small head resulting from an underdeveloped and/or damaged brain   among newborn babies. One of the highest priorities is to establish conclusively what role, if any, Zika virus has played in the marked increase in suspected microcephaly cases. In Brazil, more than 4,000 microcephaly cases have been reported since October 2015, up from 147 known cases in 2014. It is possible that these microcephaly cases could have another cause, or that a contributing factor in addition to Zika virus   another virus, for example   could be leading to the condition. Given recent reports that Zika virus may be sexually transmitted, studies also are needed to determine if the virus is present in reproductive fluids, such as semen or vaginal secretions, and whether it can cause infection via the reproductive tract. Evidence from such studies might prove important in informing guidance for preventing the spread of Zika virus through intimate contact, particularly for women who are pregnant or likely to become pregnant. Additionally, these studies may indicate whether the virus poses a hazard for in vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive procedures. Other studies of interest would investigate whether Zika virus infection affects long-term fertility in men and women and poses a risk for future pregnancies. NIH also aims to modify ongoing studies to incorporate Zika virus research. For example, current studies of pregnant women and infants could be modified to check tissue samples for the virus and to look for potential health effects in those who were exposed. The notice highlighting these research priorities was issued by NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research.

The behaviour of our cells is determined by a combination of the activity of its genes and the chemical reactions needed to maintain the cells, known as metabolism. Metabolism works in two directions: the breakdown of molecules to provide energy for the body and the production of all compounds needed by the cells. Knowing the genome   the complete DNA  blueprint  of an organism   can provide a substantial amount of information about how a particular organism will look. However, this does not give the complete picture: genes can be regulated by other genes or regions of DNA, or by  epigenetic  modifiers   small molecules attached to the DNA that act like switches to turn genes on and off. Previous studies have suggested that another player in gene regulation may exist: the metabolic network   the biochemical reactions that occur within an organism. These reactions mainly depend on the nutrients a cell has available   the sugars, amino acids, fatty acids and vitamins that are derived from the food we eat. To examine the scale at which this happens, an international team of researchers, led by Dr Markus Ralser at the University of Cambridge and the Francis Crick Institute, London, addressed the role of metabolism in the most basic functionality of a cell. They did so using yeast cells. Yeast is an ideal model organism for large scale experiments at it is much simpler to manipulate than animal models, yet many of its important genes and fundamental cellular mechanisms are the same as or very similar to those in animals and humans. The researchers manipulated the levels of important metabolites   the products of metabolic reactions   in the yeast cells and examined how this affected the behaviour of the genes and the molecules they produced. Almost nine out of ten genes and their products were affected by changes in cellular metabolism.  Cellular metabolism plays a far more dynamic role in the cells than we previously thought,  explains Dr Ralser.  Nearly all of a cell s genes are influenced by changes to the nutrients they have access to. In fact, in many cases the effects were so strong, that changing a cell s metabolic profile could make some of its genes behave in a completely different manner.  The classical view is that genes control how nutrients are broken down into important molecules, but we ve shown that the opposite is true, too: how the nutrients break down affects how our genes behave.  The researchers believe that the findings may have wide-ranging implications, including on how we respond to certain drugs. In cancers, for example, tumour cells develop multiple genetic mutations, which change the metabolic network within the cells. This in turn could affect the behaviour of the genes and may explain with some drugs fail to work for some individuals.  Another important aspect of our findings is a practical one for scientists,  explains says Dr Ralser.  Biological experiments are often not reproducible between laboratories and we often blame sloppy researchers for that. It appears however, that small metabolic differences can change the outcomes of the experiments. We need to establish new laboratory procedures that control better for differences in metabolism. This will help us to design better and more reliable experiments. ","Published: February 12, 2016"

The novel technique, pioneered by a team led by DESY scientist Professor Henry Chapman from the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science CFEL, opens up an easy way to determine the spatial structures of proteins and other molecules, many of which are practically inaccessible by existing methods. The structures of biomolecules reveal their modes of action and give insights into the workings of the machinery of life. Obtaining the molecular structure of particular proteins, for example, can provide the basis for the development of tailor-made drugs against many diseases.  Our discovery will allow us to directly view large protein complexes in atomic detail,  says Chapman, who is also a professor at the University of Hamburg and a member of the Hamburg Centre for Ultrafast Imaging CUI. To determine the spatial structure of a biomolecule, scientists mainly rely on a technique called crystallography. The new work offers a direct route to  read  the atomic structure of complex biomolecules by crystallography without the usual need for prior knowledge and chemical insight.  This discovery has the potential to become a true revolution for the crystallography of complex matter,  says the chairman of DESY's board of directors, Professor Helmut Dosch. In crystallography, the structure of a crystal and of its constituents can be investigated by shining X-rays on it. The X-rays scatter from the crystal in many different directions, producing an intricate and characteristic pattern of numerous bright spots, called Bragg peaks (named after the British crystallography pioneers William Henry and William Lawrence Bragg). The positions and strengths of these spots contain information about the structure of the crystal and of its constituents. Using this approach, researchers have already determined the atomic structures of tens of thousands of proteins and other biomolecules. But the method suffers from two significant barriers, which make structure determination extremely difficult or sometimes impossible. The first is that the molecules must be formed into very high quality crystals. Most biomolecules do not naturally form crystals. However, without the necessary perfect, regular arrangement of the molecules in the crystal, only a limited number of Bragg peaks are visible. This means the structure cannot be determined, or at best only a fuzzy  low resolution  facsimile of the molecule can be found. This barrier is most severe for large protein complexes such as membrane proteins. These systems participate in a range of biological processes and many are the targets of today's drugs. Great skill and quite some luck are needed to obtain high-quality crystals of them.  Extreme Sudoku in three dimensions  The second barrier is that the structure of a complex molecule is still extremely difficult to determine, even when good diffraction is available.  This task is like extreme Sudoku in three dimensions and a million boxes, but with only half the necessary clues,  explains Chapman. In crystallography, this puzzle is referred to as the phase problem. Without knowing the phase   the lag of the crests of one diffracted wave to another   it is not possible to compute an image of the molecule from the measured diffraction pattern. But phases can t be measured. To solve the tricky phase puzzle, more information must be known than just the measured Bragg peaks. This additional information can sometimes be obtained by X-raying crystals of chemically modified molecules, or by already knowing the structure of a closely-related molecule. When thinking about why protein crystals do not always  diffract , Chapman realised that imperfect crystals and the phase problem are linked. The key lies in a weak  continuous  scattering that arises when crystals become disordered. Usually, this non-Bragg, continuous diffraction is thought of as a nuisance, although it can be useful for providing insights into vibrations and dynamics of molecules. But when the disorder consists only of displacements of the individual molecules from their ideal positions in the crystal then the  background  takes on a much more complex character   and its rich structure is anything but diffuse. It then offers a much bigger prize than the analysis of the Bragg peaks: the continuously-modulated  background  fully encodes the diffracted waves from individual  single  molecules.  If you would shoot X-rays on a single molecule, it would produce a continuous diffraction pattern free of any Bragg spots,  explains lead author Dr. Kartik Ayyer from Chapman's CFEL group at DESY.  The pattern would be extremely weak, however, and very difficult to measure. But the  background  in our crystal analysis is like accumulating many shots from individually-aligned single molecules. We essentially just use the crystal as a way to get a lot of single molecules, aligned in common orientations, into the beam.  With imperfect, disordered crystals, the continuous diffraction fills in the gaps and beyond the Bragg peaks, giving vastly more information than in normal crystallography. With this additional gain in information, the phase problem can be uniquely solved without having to resort to other measurements or assumptions. In the analogy of the Sudoku puzzle, the measurements provide enough clues to always arrive at the right answer. The best crystals are imperfect crystals This novel concept leads to a paradigm shift in crystallography   the most ordered crystals are no longer the best to analyse with the novel method. Instead, the best crystals are imperfect crystals.  For the first time we have access to single molecule diffraction   we have never had this in crystallography before,  he explains.  But we have long known how to solve single-molecule diffraction if we could measure it.  The field of coherent diffractive imaging, spurred by the availability of laser-like beams from X-ray free-electron lasers, has developed powerful algorithms to directly solve the phase problem in this case, without having to know anything at all about the molecule.  You don t even have to know chemistry,  says Chapman,  but you can learn it by looking at the three-dimensional image you get.  To demonstrate their novel analysis method, the Chapman group teamed up with the group of Professor Petra Fromme from the Arizona State University (ASU), and other colleagues from ASU, University of Wisconsin, the Greek Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas FORTH, and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in the U.S. They used the world's most powerful X-ray laser LCLS at SLAC to X-ray imperfect microcrystals of a membrane protein complex called Photosystem II that is part of the photosynthesis machinery in plants. Including the continuous diffraction pattern into the analysis immediately improved the spatial resolution around a quarter from 4.5  ngstr m to 3.5  ngstr m (an  ngstr m is 0.1 nanometres). The obtained image gave fine definition of molecular features that usually require fitting a chemical model to see.  That is a pretty big deal for biomolecules,  explains co-author Dr. Anton Barty from DESY.  And we can further improve the resolution if we take more patterns.  The team had only a few hours of measuring time for these experiments, while full-scale measuring campaigns usually last a couple of days. The scientists hope to obtain even clearer and higher resolution images of photosystem II and many other macromolecules with their new technique.  This kind of continuous diffraction has actually been seen for a long time from many different poorly-diffracting crystals,  says Chapman.  It wasn t understood that you can get structural information from it and so analysis techniques suppressed it. We re going to be busy to see if we can solve structures of molecules from old discarded data. ","Published: February 12, 2016"

Experiments conducted on both individual cells and laboratory animals indicate that the presence of vitamin B1 inside the cell can prevent the damage caused by high blood sugar. Together with Professor Massimo Porta from the University of Turin, Italy, Professor Per-Henrik Groop, Principal Investigator of the FinnDiane research project at the University of Helsinki and Folkh lsan Research Centre, Finland, and his research group have studied the impact of point mutations on the genes that encode the proteins which transfer vitamin B1 into cells. The research was based on the hypothesis that the studied mutations impact the individual's capacity to transfer vitamin B1 into cells and consequently the susceptibility for additional complications associated with diabetes. The research used the world's most extensive research data set of type 1 diabetes patients, compiled by Groop's group, in which the patients are characterised based on their genetic profile and the severity of their diabetes complications. The results showed that two of the studied point mutations in the SLC19A3 gene were strongly associated with both retinopathy and the combination of retinopathy and nephropathy; thus, carriers of the genetic variant were less likely to have these complications. The protective effect of the variant remained significant even when other common risk factors were taken into account. The study was repeated on North American patient data, and the results confirmed that the two variants protect their carriers from the combination of retinopathy and nephropathy. ""Based on these results, it seems that the SLC19A3 gene has a role in the development of diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy. The results also help explain why some patients with type 1 diabetes are more likely to develop complications than others,"" says Iiro Toppila, the researcher responsible for analysing the data.

Working in collaboration with the Bristol Urological Institute team at Southmead Hospital and Bristol Royal Infirmary, the pilot study included 155 men presenting to urology clinics. Of this group, 58 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 24 with bladder cancer and 73 with haematuria or poor stream without cancer. The results of the pilot study using the GC sensor system indicate that it is able to successfully identify different patterns of volatile compounds that allow classification of urine samples from patients with urological cancers. Urgent need for earlier diagnosis Professor Chris Probert from the University of Liverpool s Institute of Translational Medicine began work on this project with UWE Bristol when he was working in Bristol as a gastroenterologist with clinical and research interest in inflammatory bowel disease. The research team used a gas chromatography sensor system called Odoreader that was developed by a team led by Professor Probert and Professor Norman Ratcliffe at UWE Bristol. The test involves inserting urine samples into the Odoreader that are then measured using algorithms developed by the research team at the University of Liverpool and UWE Bristol. Professor Probert, said:  There is an urgent need to identify these cancers at an earlier stage when they are more treatable as the earlier a person is diagnosed the better. After further sample testing the next step is to take this technology and put it into a user friendly format. With help from industry partners we will be able to further develop the Odoreader, which will enable it to be used where it is needed most; at a patient s bedside, in a doctor s surgery, in a clinic or Walk In Centre, providing fast, inexpensive, accurate results.  Like an electronic nose Professor Norman Ratcliffe said,  There is currently no accurate test for prostate cancer, the vagaries of the PSA test indicators can sometimes result in unnecessary biopsies, resulting in psychological toll, risk of infection from the procedure and even sometimes missing cancer cases. Our aim is to create a test that avoids this procedure at initial diagnosis by detecting cancer in a non-invasive way by smelling the disease in men s urine. A few years ago we did similar work to detect bladder cancer following a discovery that dogs could sniff out cancer. We have been using the Odoreader, which is like an electronic nose to sense the cancer.  The Odoreader has a 30 metre column that enables the compounds in the urine to travel through at different rates thus breaking the sample into a readable format. This is then translated into an algorithm enabling detection of cancer by reading the patterns presented. The positioning of the prostate gland which is very close to the bladder gives the urine profile a different algorithm if the man has cancer. Mr Raj Prasad, Consultant Urologist at Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust, said:  If this test succeeds at full medical trial it will revolutionise diagnostics. Even with detailed template biopsies there is a risk that we may fail to detect prostate cancer in some cases. Currently indicators such as diagnosed prostatomegaly (enlarged prostate) and unusually high PSA levels can lead to recommendations for biopsy if there is a concern that cancer may be prevalent. An accurate urine test would mean that many men who currently undergo prostate biopsy may not need to do so. ","Published: February 12, 2016"

Kamp reports transforming mouse fibroblasts, cells found mostly in connective tissue such as skin, into primitive master heart cells known as induced cardiac progenitor cells. The technology could permit a scalable method for making an almost unlimited supply of the three major types of cells in the heart. If replicated in human cells, the feat could one day fuel drug discovery, powerful new models for heart disease and the raw material for treating diseased hearts. The lead author of the new study, UW Madison postdoctoral fellow Pratik A. Lalit, found that 11 genes that play a central role in embryonic heart development could be used to reprogram the fibroblasts. He and his colleagues then narrowed the number of essential genes to five. Importantly, the group also defined the conditions necessary for the transformed cells to be effectively cultured in the laboratory. Using the five genes, Lalit, Kamp and their team could push the fibroblast cells back in developmental time to become the cardiac progenitor cells that make cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells   the trio of workhorse cells that make up the organ. The induced cardiac progenitor cells are capable of making billions of the critical heart cells, providing ample material to study heart disease in the laboratory dish, equip high-throughput screens to test various compounds for safety and efficacy, and ultimately, to treat heart disease by replacing diseased cells with healthy ones.  Because the reprogrammed cells are actively dividing, we can generate billions of cells with relative ease,  says Kamp, who also co-directs the UW-Madison Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Center. The study, explains Lalit, was like an exercise in reverse engineering: observing the genetic factors in play as the heart develops in a mouse embryo and using those to direct the fibroblast down the cardiac developmental pathway or lineage.  We re learning from what happens in the embryo during cardiac development,  he says.  What does it take to make a normal heart?  A key advantage of the engineered cardiac progenitor cells, notes Kamp, is that unlike all-purpose pluripotent stem cells, which can become any of the 220 different kinds of cells in the human body, the induced progenitor cells made from fibroblasts are faithful only to the cardiac lineage   a desired feature for cardiac applications. A potential drawback of cell transplants derived from all-purpose stem cells is the small but very real possibility of creating a teratoma, a tumor from tissue other than the intended cell lineage.  With cardiac progenitor cells, you can reduce the risk of tumor formation as they are more committed to the heart lineages and are unlikely to form a tumor,  says Kamp. Lalit and Kamp s team tested the new cells in mice by experimentally inducing heart attacks. Injecting the engineered cells into the damaged hearts of mice, they observed the cells migrating to the damaged part of the heart and making cardiomyocytes   the heart cells that contract to underpin the beating of the heart   as well as smooth muscle and endothelial cells, key cells that form blood vessels. The implanted cells led to an uptick in survival of the heart-impaired mice.","Published: February 12, 2016"

Most cancer research to date has focused on understanding the inner workings of cancer cells, and the majority of existing therapies target malignant cells in isolation, working to shrink or remove them through surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. However, in recent years, more scientists have begun to explore not only the cancer ""seed"" but its surrounding ""soil,"" meaning other factors in the microenvironment surrounding a cancer that cause tumors to grow and spread. Scientists believe that understanding how cancer feeds on its environment could lead to new ways to starve it of conditions required for growth. ""It's only more recently that people have really appreciated that tumors are complex organs in and of themselves with all of the heterogenous cell types that can talk to each other and promote each other's survival and proliferation,"" says Lauren Ehrlich, an assistant professor of molecular biosciences, who led the team that published the most recent study. Ehrlich's team found for the first time that a neighboring cell in the soil around T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) creates the necessary condition for that cancer to grow. Without the interaction with the outside cell, the cancer collapses, unable to grow or survive the way it does in a T-ALL patient. In a healthy person, T-cells help fight off infections and disease in partnership with another type of cell, called dendritic cells. Dendritic cells help T-cells find and attack pathogens, and they groom new T-cells to prevent them from mistakenly fighting off healthy parts of the body. Ehrlich and her team discovered that in T-ALL these dendritic cells essentially send the wrong message, signaling T-cells that had turned cancerous to survive and expand. T-ALL afflicts mostly children, with more than 500 new pediatric diagnoses in the United States annually. The leukemia, which occurs in a child's developing T-cells, is fatal in about 1 in 4 cases. In the remaining patients with the disease, T-ALL requires intense levels of chemotherapy or radiation. ""It's obviously very toxic, and these kids are living with the morbidity effects of these very toxic therapies throughout their lives,"" Ehrlich says. ""So if we can find directed therapies to more specifically target the tumors without being overly toxic to the person, that would obviously be much better."" Ehrlich and her team studied cancerous cell lines associated with T-ALL in a variety of ways. When the cancer cells were in a neutral culture or surrounded by a mix of cells similar to what would be found in a healthy person, no growth occurred, and the cancer died off. Only in a mix similar to what is actually found in the soil of a T-ALL patient could the cancer survive and spread. The dendritic cells spurred that growth in all cases, both for newly developing T-ALL cells as well as tumors that had spread to distant organs in experimental models. Tissue samples from Texas Children's Hospital confirmed similar growth environments with abundant dendritic cells in pediatric patients. Previous research has found similar patterns with cancers of the blood, breast and skin, where a variety of noncancerous cells send signals that are necessary to cause tumors to survive and grow. ""We hope this study will be a catalyst to spur other research groups to further elucidate the roles of dendritic cells in supporting T-ALL,"" said Todd Triplett, a postdoctoral researcher and a lead author on the study, ""since that could ultimately lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets that are more effective and less toxic than current treatment regimens.""","Published: February 12, 2016"

Functioning like a biological actuator, R bodies respond to pH levels to extend from a tightly bound coil to a long, thin structure akin to a nanoscale needle or javelin. In nature, the bacteria containing R bodies are shed by a ""killer strain"" of single-celled organisms called paramecia. When a paramecium of a different strain ingests these shed bacteria containing R bodies, a difference in pH level between the two strains causes the R bodies to extend and puncture the bacteria s cell walls, releasing toxins that kill the host paramecium. But in synthetic biology, R bodies now represent a whole new way of controlling delivery of beneficial molecules such as biologic therapies, pharmaceutical drugs or other payloads to specific cells. ""Our research establishes R bodies as biological machines that we can use to break through membranes,  said Jessica Polka, Ph.D., a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Wyss Institute and HMS, who was first author on the study.  These actuators don t consume molecular fuel and are extremely robust; we believe they could one day be used to deliver material to mammalian cells."" Importantly, R bodies present a physical rather than genetic strategy for manipulating cells. At high pH levels, R bodies resemble a coil of ribbon. But at lower pH levels, they undergo a conformational change converting them into pointy hollow tubes capable of puncturing through membranes, breaking that barrier and releasing any cargo contained inside. By modifying the pH level that triggers this response, R bodies become a tunable platform for controlling release of toxins or therapies. ""These R bodies also can be thought of as scaffolds for new biomaterials,  said Silver.  By decorating these polymers with different kinds of metals or other materials with properties of interest, we could potentially develop a range of actuator-like, nanoscale structures."" What s also unique about R bodies is their reversibility. Although they extend in low pH, they retract back into a tight coil when the pH level rises. In biological systems, reversibility is not a common property but is of much interest to synthetic biologists like Polka and Silver. Since bacterial and eukaryotic cells all contain compartmentalized membranes, a reversible system for breaking barriers establishes a mechanical strategy for precisely controlling cells. This advance could potentially lead to a range of applications in biotechnology and medicine such as creation of new programmable biomaterials, drug delivery, and ecosystem management. ""There are so many amazing mechanisms engineered by Nature, and this is a great example of how we can mine living systems for unique biological elements and adapt them to develop programmable technologies for high value applications using synthetic biology,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at HMS and the Vascular Biology Program at Children s Hospital and Professor of Engineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.","Published: February 12, 2016"

These tiny creatures, Caenorhabditis elegans, feed on soil bacteria, and their very lives depend on their ability to distinguish toxic microbes from nutritious ones. In a recent study, Bargmann and her colleagues have shown that worms in their first larval stage can learn what harmful bacterial strains smell like, and form aversions to those smells that last into adulthood. Many animals are capable of making vital, lifelong memories during a critical period soon after birth. The phenomenon, known as imprinting, allows newly hatched geese to bond with their moms, and makes it possible for salmon to return to their native stream after spawning. And while the learning processes of humans may be more complex and subtle, scientists have long known that our brain's ability to store a memory and maintain it long-term depends on when and how that memory was acquired. See Also: Researchers provide first peek at how neurons multitask ""In the case of worms, we were fascinated to discover that their small and simple nervous system is capable of not only remembering things, but of forming long-term memories,"" says Bargmann, who is Torsten N. Wiesel Professor and head of the Lulu and Anthony Wang Laboratory of Neural Circuits and Behavior, as well as co-director of the new Kavli Neural Systems Institute at Rockefeller. ""It invites the question of whether learning processes that happen during different life stages are biologically different."" In the study, she and Rockefeller graduate student Xin Jin let both young and adult worms learn to avoid food smells, and studied in detail the neural circuits that produced memories of the experience. Their findings, published in Cell, clarify which neurons, genes, and molecular pathways distinguish the two types of memory, providing new vistas into the neurobiology of learning. When adult C. elegans worms encounter pathogenic bacteria they avoid it by moving in the opposite direction, and they shun similar bacteria for about twenty-four hours. But their memory soon fades. Young worms, on the other hand, form more lasting impressions. The researchers allowed newborn worms to hatch directly onto a lawn of pathogens, and left them there for their first twelve hours of life the first larval stage. (The bugs gave the worms intestinal infections, but didn't kill them). Then, when the worms encountered the pathogens again as adults three days later they fled. Worms that hadn't been hatched onto poisonous bacteria found them just as attractive as harmless ones. Jin found that by silencing specific neurons in the worms, and repeating the learning assays, she was able to determine each nerve cell's contribution to the memory process. The results of her experiments show that the neural circuits that mediate the two types of learning are similar, but not identical. Many neurons are needed for both imprinted and adult learning, but cells called AIB and RIM are uniquely important for the formation of the imprinted memory during the larval stage. A similar picture emerged when the researchers compared the genes and signaling pathways that are activated when worms form imprinted versus short-term memories. The two processes rely on similar molecular components, but some genes were found to be specifically required for only one type of learning. ""These findings suggest that early imprinting isn't totally different from other learning--it's the same system enhanced with some special features,"" Bargmann says. Several neurological processes are at play when we learn new things. For example, when a baby songbird learns a song from an adult bird, a memory of the tutor's performance must first form and be stored in his brain. Then, when it's time for the bird to debut with his own song, that memory must be retrieved to practice and then perform a vocal behavior. Because most animals' brains are very complex, it has been difficult for scientists to study these elements of learning in detail. By using C. elegans, whose modest brain has only 302 neurons, the researchers were able to shed light on the neural circuits that drive the formation and retrieval of a worm's memory and the two processes turned out to be neurologically distinct.

How memories are stored in the brain in what neurons they reside and what constitutes them at the molecular level remains elusive. But Bargmann says her lab's findings have laid the groundwork for future research into stored memory and other open questions. ""The most evocative thing about this work is that it reminds us that learning isn't some fancy innovation of a complex brain,"" she says. ""It's a fundamental function that any nervous system can perform."" The Rockefeller University  press release Jin X, Pokala N, Bargmann CI.

The drug, trade name Byetta, derives from a naturally occurring hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, which regulates feeding behavior. Knowing what they did about GLP-1, Matthew Hayes and Heath Schmidt, of Nursing and of Psychiatry, and Bart De Jonghe, of Nursing, turned to it as a possible treatment for cocaine addicts. Learn More: New evidence in mice that cocaine makes brain cells cannibalize themselves Previously, Hayes, whose primary appointment is at the Perelman School of Medicine, had completed a GLP-1 study comparing consumption of palatable food to normal chow: as Schmidt put it, a burger and fries versus a salad. Activation of GLP-1 receptors in a specific part of the brain, according to this work, reduced intake of that burger meal but did nothing, good or bad, to salad consumption. Additionally, previous literature showed an overlap between the neural circuits that influence feeding and drug taking. With this groundwork laid, the researchers formulated a straightforward hypothesis. ""If GLP-1 regulates intake of palatable food, then perhaps it also regulates consumption of cocaine,"" Schmidt said. ""That was it in a nutshell."" The hypothesis turned out to be true. In a two-and-a-half year study of rats, the trio showed that when they activated GLP-1 receptors in the region of the brain that deals with reward behavior, called the ventral tegmental area, or VTA, the animals self-administered less cocaine. It's the first time such a role has been shown for GLP-1 in the brain. Physiologically, GLP-1 acts similarly in rat brains and human brains. Rather than injecting cocaine, the scientists modeled the way a human would take the drug by offering the study rats a lever to press for intravenous infusions. Once the animals stabilized in their drug-taking regimen, the researchers introduced the GLP-1 receptor agonist directly into the brain. ""We're looking at what activation of GLP-1 receptors in the VTA does to the animal's self-administration of cocaine,"" Schmidt said. ""We were able to show a nice decrease in cocaine self-administration."" Though no human trials have been completed, something Schmidt acknowledges is still several steps away, there's one fewer barrier because of the drug's FDA approval. Clinicians have likely already heard of it, and those with a particular patient population have potentially already prescribed it. The drug, whose side effects are known, has already been proven safe for human use. Getting to human clinical trials would go a long way toward meeting a long-term goal for Schmidt, who is lead author on a new paper detailing these findings in the Nature journal Neuropsychopharmacology. ""Our interest is really to understand how chronic exposure to drugs of abuse changes the brain to produce addiction-like behaviors,"" said Schmidt, who has also authored another similiar paper, about nicotine and a potential smoking-cessation medication. Learn More: Novel compound halts cocaine addiction and relapse behaviors To move forward the GLP-1 project specifically, Schmidt said the team plans to next focus on the pathway it follows in the brain. ""That gets into a systems neuroscience approach, into the circuitry underlying the behavior,"" he said. ""It's really provocative.... We talk about the VTA and the reward circuit that drives cocaine taking. But there's also this pathway that cocaine is activating that's functioning as a 'brake' to try and stop or reduce the behavior."" There are more pieces of the puzzle to solve. But, if this research continues to progress successfully, those working to treat cocaine addiction may soon have another option in their toolkit.

One of the invariable pathologies in AD is degeneration of cholinergic synapses in brain cortex and hippocampus. Despite enormous effort to find out an efficient treatment, current pharmacological interventions are limited to a few drugs that alleviate symptoms but do not slow down the underlying disease processes. These drugs include inhibitors of cholinesterases, enzymes that degrade the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, or memantine, a modulator of glutamate neurotransmission. See Also: Drug-resistant epilepsy diet: Therapeutic mechanism uncovered It is generally accepted that lifestyle and particularly dietary habits influence mental health, and prevalence and progression of AD. Numerous epidemiological studies have revealed profitable effects of dietary intake of especially fish oil on cognitive decline during aging and dementia. Within the EU-funded project LipiDiDiet which is investigating the therapeutic and preventive impact of nutritional lipids on neuronal and cognitive performance in aging, Alzheimer s disease and vascular dementia, researchers devised several lipid-based diets aimed at slowing down progression and relieving symptoms of AD. Learn More: Taking B vitamins won't prevent Alzheimer's disease Short-term (3 weeks) feeding of young adult APPswe/PS1dE9 mice (a transgenic mouse model of AD) with experimental diets containing fish oil or stigmasterol reversed the decrease in responsiveness of hippocampal muscarinic receptors to acetylcholine compared to their non-transgenic littermates. Only fish oil based diet enriched with nutrients supporting neuroprotection (Fortasyn diet) increased in addition the density of muscarinic receptors and cholinergic synapses in the hippocampus. These findings yield important proof-of-principle evidence that regular intake of specific dietary components may help to prevent some of the key early functional changes that take place in the Alzheimer brain.

Synthetic biology has progressed by leaps and bounds since researchers first induced E. coli bacteria to make human insulin in the 1970s. Today, biological engineers coax microorganisms to perform numerous complex chemistries, such as breaking down plant material for biofuels. However, scientists still rely on a limited complement of components to control their synthetic circuits.  We were frustrated because synthetic biology is littered with examples of artificial factors that can turn on and turn off gene expression under different conditions, but they only work for certain genes,  says Brian Pfleger, a UW Madison associate professor of chemical and biological engineering. Pfleger s group developed a way to turn off almost any gene in E. coli. Their approach borrowed a trick from nature to achieve human goals. The team modified proteins called TALEs (transcription activator-like effectors)  to make tools that seek and silence diverse arrays of genes. TALE proteins come from bacteria that normally infect plants. The bacteria typically inject TALEs into plant cells to make them more susceptible to infection.  These pathogens piggyback on the molecular biology of higher organisms to manipulate them,  says Ph.D. student Mark Politz, the lead author of the study.  It s kind of an ingenious little trick they re playing on their host.  Politz and Pfleger took advantage of the same sneaky strategy. Natural TALEs attach to specific sections of plant genomes. The protein reads the plant s DNA and wraps itself around specific regions of the double helix like a boa constrictor. Once a TALE finds its target, it recruits the plant s own machinery to activate nearby genes. Previous research established which parts of the TALE recognize specific letters in the DNA alphabet, giving the Pfleger group a way to program these proteins to target any sequence they desired   and they tweaked the TALEs so that the proteins repressed rather than promoted gene expression. The engineered TALEs allowed them to temporarily turn off specific genes, without drastically altering the original organism.  The great possibility for using TALEs is adding another layer of gene regulation that we can apply over top of what s already present in the natural bacteria,  says Politz. Scientists can easily erase genes by removing sections of DNA from some bacterial genomes. However, large deletions lack subtlety and often carry unforeseen consequences.  Instead of going in and messing up all of the things nature has created in the cell, I just want to make less of a protein. And I want to do it in an inducible manner. I want to make less only when I want to make less,  Politz says. Counterintuitively, the most significant obstacle to creating the tool was finding a way to turn off the off switch. Once TALEs wrap themselves around their target, they typically remain in position, exerting their effects indefinitely. In order to engineer a truly inducible system, the team introduced a deactivation mechanism. The results established proof of principle in E. coli, one of the most commonly used organisms in modern biology. However, the researchers see applications for their approach across the tree of life.  The tools that Mark s been developing are an example of what s taking place in biotechnology right now,  Pfleger says.  We re generalizing what we could do with organisms that have better inherent properties, like metabolisms that would be useful for biofuels.  Several members of the Pfleger group contributed to the effort. Former postdoctoral scholar Matt Copeland, now employed at Procter & Gamble, designed several experiments and worked with Politz to write the manuscript. Andrew Markley, a postdoctoral fellow, ideated an important control. Charles Johnson, an undergraduate researcher who is now pursuing a Ph.D. at Washington University in St. Louis, was instrumental in designing the TALEs. The research was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation, the National Human Genome Research Institute, and the National Institutes of Health.","Published: February 11, 2016"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/madison-researchers-begin-work-on-zika-virus-200044,Madison Researchers Begin Work on Zika Virus Work will start with basic questions about Zika virus infection  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In October, when David O Connor last visited Brazil as part of a decade-long research program studying drug-resistant strains of HIV, one of his Brazilian collaborators had a request.  He asked about using some of the technologies we have developed to look for new viruses to study some unusual cases of a birth defect, microcephaly, in the north of Brazil,  says O Connor, a University of Wisconsin Madison pathology professor. The babies born with underdeveloped brains and small heads were the relatively quiet beginning of worry over the spread of Zika virus, concern that has grown louder outside Brazil with an international outbreak and emergency attention from public health officials around the world.  At the time we didn t know it would explode into the public consciousness like it did,  O Connor says.  But we did start planning.  That planning will soon culminate in some of the first experiments studying Zika virus in monkeys, conducted by a broad UW Madison team that includes the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center and expertise in infectious disease, pregnancy and neurology. Pathobiological sciences Professor Jorge Osorio and research scientist Matthew Aliota, who were first to identify the Zika virus circulating in Colombia in October, provided essential Zika virology expertise. Ted Golos, professor of obstetrics and comparative biosciences, studies how other infections during pregnancy impact newborn health. The research group has extensive experience with viruses in humans and nonhuman primates   such as HIV and influenza   and their work will be conducted in secure facilities designed for the safe study of potentially harmful viruses. Their work will start with basic questions about Zika virus infection. Very little is known about the virus even though more than 50 years have passed since it was discovered in the Zika Forest in Uganda. Until recently, Zika was expected to cause little more than flu-like symptoms   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists fever, joint paint and a headache   in about 20 percent of the people it infected.  That s why it s an understudied virus,  O Connor says.  The viruses that get the most attention are the ones that makes us the most sick.  The rapid spread of the virus and potential connection to an otherwise rare birth defect have drawn plenty of attention from the public and from government officials.  People want clear answers, and we want to be able to make clear public health recommendations,  says Thomas Friedrich, a UW Madison professor of pathobiological sciences.  There are a lot of countries in the tropics right now saying,  Don t get pregnant until 2018.  That s not a sustainable public health recommendation.  In January, the National Institutes of Health made Zika virus research a high priority, and the groundwork underway at UW Madison led to NIH support for a series of studies of the virus in macaques, monkeys whose physiology and immune systems are similar to humans. The researchers will track the effects of initial infections, but also try to establish whether one Zika virus infection provides some protection against future infection   like chicken pox does. Zika does not mutate particularly fast, the feature of HIV and influenza that makes those viruses hard to pin down with vaccines (like HIV) and leaves people open to reinfection seasonally (like flu). This may make Zika easier to head off with a vaccine, but the best sort of immune response to provoke with a vaccine is not yet known.  That s why we need to have data that shows what natural immunity looks like and the sort of immune responses that arise to protect an individual when they encounter that virus again,  O Connor says. Perhaps more hotly anticipated will be results from planned studies of Zika and pregnancy.  We strongly suspect Zika infection during pregnancy is associated with birth defects such as microcephaly,  Friedrich says.  But we don t know how strong the link is, or what percentage of women who get infected might give birth to children with birth defects.  Or whether the timing of the infection during pregnancy matters. Or whether it is direct infection of a developing fetus by the virus or the immune response the infection sparks in pregnant women that causes problems like microcephaly.  There are questions that cannot be safely and ethically addressed in humans that are absolutely vital,  O Connor says.  What we will learn about Zika from the monkeys will hopefully have an immediate application when figuring out how to deal with this from a public health perspective.  Working with the Zika virus from the original 1947 discovery in Africa and from the ongoing South American outbreak   provided by UW Madison Osorio and Aliota, who were first to identify Zika virus circulating in Colombia in October   the researchers also hope to identify any important differences in infection by the different strains. O Connor also hopes results from the studies will help settle minds around the world, and help change the tenor of Zika news stories.  The more hyperbolic the media coverage is, the more it gets repeated, reposted, retweeted,  he says.  The key messages are that we don t know a lot. We will know a lot 12 months from now. But it s really important we let data guide the decision making, not our guts. ","Published: February 11, 2016"

The research could have far-reaching applications in fields ranging from improving industrial efficiencies to pioneering new medical diagnostics, guiding targeted drug delivery and producing smart materials. The work also promises to shed new light on particulars of cellular organization and metabolism. The technique involves the design of specialized, nanometer-scale cages, which self-assemble from lengths of DNA. The cages hold enzyme and substrate in close proximity, considerably accelerating the rate of reactions and shielding them from degradation.   We have been designing programmable DNA nanostructures with increasing complexity for many years, and it is now time to ask what can we do with these structures,  said Yan, who is also a professor in ASU s School of Molecular Sciences in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.  There are numerous other applications from this emerging technology. Through our interdisciplinary collaborative effort, we here describe the use of designer DNA nanocages to compartmentalize enzymatic reactions in a confined environment. Drawing inspiration from nature, we have uncovered interesting properties, some unexpected.  Zhao Zhao, a researcher in the Center for Molecular Design and Biomimetics, was the lead author of the paper, which was co-authored with researchers from ASU's Department of Chemistry, Rutgers and the University of Michigan. Enzyme world As chemical activators for virtually every reaction in the body, enzymes are key participants in the normal activity of cells, tissues, fluids and organs. Hundreds of thousands of metabolic enzymes are present in the human body, involved in diverse activities including DNA copying and repair and the transformation of glucose into useable energy. Elsewhere, some 22 digestive enzymes break down carbohydrates (amylases), fats (lipases ) and sugars (disaccharides), while so-called protease enzymes digest proteins. Enzymes tend to be highly specific, not only in the useful functions they perform, but the precise substrates with which they will work. Substrate molecules of exactly the right size and shape bind with their appropriate enzymes as the correct key fits into the ridges and grooves of a lock. Substrates latch onto enzyme molecules at a particular region known as the active site. Once enzyme and substrate have combined, a chemical product is formed and then released, returning the enzyme to its original configuration where it is ready to operate on a new molecule of substrate. In order for such reactions to take place in an efficient manner, nature has devised methods of compartmentalization, forming natural reactor sites where enzyme-substrate reactions unfold. The cell itself is such a compartment, as are various membrane-bound organelles found in eukaryotes (cells containing a nucleus), including mitochondria, lysosomes and peroxisomes. Compartmentalization of reactants helps to overcome a variety of challenges, bringing binding chemicals into cozy proximity, isolating enzyme-substrate complexes from competing reaction chemicals, improving the yield of product molecules produced and reducing the toxicity various intermediary chemicals can sometimes cause. In order to induce or catalyze chemical reactions for a variety of purposes, synthetic biologists have copied a page from Nature s recipe book, designing artificial compartments fabricated from proteins, lipids or the nucleic acids found in DNA (as in the current study). Close encounters Yan and his colleagues designed their synthetic reactors to house enzymes and their substrates, allowing chemical conversions to take place in a controlled environment. Each minute structure, measuring just 54 nanometers across, is something like a Faberge egg whose separate halves fit together to encapsulate their chemical contents. (A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter or roughly 80,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair.) Using the base pairing properties of DNA s four nucleotides   labeled A, T, C and G   allows nanoscale architects like Yan to construct myriad forms in two- and three-dimensions. In the new study, DNA nanocages were used to encapsulate metabolic enzymes with high assembly yield and fine-tuned control over reactants and products. The construction of the nanocages takes place in two steps. First, individual enzymes are attached into open half-cage structures. Then, the half-cages are fitted together into a full, closed nanocage. To create the half-cages, a technique known as DNA origami is used. Lengths of viral DNA are prepared to self-assemble into a honeycomb lattice, with A nucleotides pairing with C and T with G.   The open-sided half-cages of the DNA nanocages allow the access of large protein molecules into the nanocage s internal cavity. The two half-cages are fitted together with the aid of short bridge DNA strands that bind with complementary DNA sequences extending from the edges of either half-cage (see animation below). The small gaps on each of the top and bottom surfaces of the DNA nanocage allow the diffusion of small molecules across the DNA walls. Probing the nanoscale To examine the resulting structures Transmission Electron Microscopy was used, along with gel electrophoresis and single-molecule fluorescence experiments, which demonstrated that close to 100 percent of the DNA segments properly formed half-cage structures and more than 90 percent formed full cages.  The study examined six different enzymes, ranging in size from the smallest, which measured ~44kD (kilodaltons) to the largest, ~ 450 kD. All six enzymes were successfully encapsulated in nanocages, though the yields varied according to enzyme size. The largest enzyme examined, known as  -galactosidase, showed the lowest yield of 64 percent. Next, the activity of enzyme-substrate pairs was evaluated. In addition to bringing the enzyme-substrate pair into closer binding proximity, encapsulation in the nanocage is also believed to facilitate activity through the unique electrical charge density conditions within the nanocage. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that most of the effect on enzyme-substrate activity in nanocages is due to the unique charge environment within nanocages, rather than enzyme-substrate proximity. The authors suggest that encapsulated enzymes exhibit higher activity within densely packed DNA cages as a result of the highly ordered, hydrogen-bonded water environment surrounding them. An evaluation of enzyme activity showed a 4- to 10-fold increase for enzymes encapsulated in nanocages, compared with the activity of free enzymes. Enzyme turnover rate   defined as the maximum number of chemical conversions of substrate molecules per second   was inversely correlated with the size of encapsulated enzymes, with the smallest enzyme yielding the highest turnover. Future cages The DNA cages demonstrated their resiliency during the experiments, retaining their structural form throughout the enzymatic reactions. They also protected encapsulated enzymes from deactivation due to digestive chemicals, while permitting the uninterrupted diffusion of small-molecule substrates and reaction products through the nanopores of the DNA cage. Encapsulation in nanocages was shown to increase the fraction of active enzyme molecules and their individual turnover numbers. The method thus provides a new molecular tool to modify the local environment surrounding enzymes and their substrates, opening the door to new applications in smart materials and biomedical applications. Among the latter are futuristic, programmable cages that could be used as nanoscale delivery mechanisms for a wide range of therapeutic agents.","Published: February 11, 2016"

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-source-of-mutations-in-cancer-202957,New Source of Mutations in Cancer Recently  a new mutation signature found in cancer cells was suspected to have been created by a family of enzymes found in human cells called the APOBEC  family  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Mutations are the replacement of DNA bases known as Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Thymine (T) with other bases. When mutations such as C to T or G to A are found within a specific DNA sequence, this is known as a mutation signature. These mutation signatures are like spelling mistakes that carry signs of the agents that caused the mutations. Ultraviolet light, tobacco smoke and other cancer-causing agents leave behind such signatures in the DNA of tumors.  The study, ""Strand-biased Cytosine deamination at the Replication Fork causes Cytosine to Thymine Mutations in Escherichia coli,"" led by Ashok Bhagwat, Ph.D., professor of chemistry in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Wayne State University. In addition to Bhagwat, collaborators from Wayne State University and Indiana University have determined the target within DNA that is attacked by APOBEC3 enzymes. Results from this basic science research project provide an understanding of a major source of mutations that may drive tumor growth and also explains a key finding in microbial evolution. DNA consists of two thin strands that are made up of the four bases, which are arranged in specific sequences, creating words and chapters that contain the secrets of the cell. The two DNA strands are intertwined with each other to protect the bases from damage by chemicals and enzymes. Unfortunately, the cell must copy its DNA before it can divide. This copying process requires that the two DNA strands are briefly separated, making DNA ""single-stranded"" and thus susceptible to damage. According to Bhagwat, an odd quirk of DNA biochemistry is that one of the DNA strands, known as the lagging-strand template (LGST), stays single much longer than its counterpart, the leading-strand template (LDST). The WSU/IU team showed that APOBEC3 enzymes preferentially attack the LGST, causing mutations during DNA copying. ""We did this work using the simple bacterium Escherichia coli as a model, introducing the active part of the human enzyme APOBEC3G in it,"" said Bhagwat. ""The advantage of using E. coli is that its complete DNA sequence can be easily determined and the way it copies its DNA is well understood."" Bhagwat's research team has been studying the larger AID/APOBEC family of enzymes for the past 14 years and has helped show that this family of enzymes converts C to an abnormal base called Uracil (U). The U gets repaired back to C most of the time, but sometimes this process fails and U is fixed as a T. This is called a C-to-T mutation. Bhagwat initiated collaboration with Patricia Foster, Ph.D., at Indiana University and provided her group the A3G gene to express in E. coli. They determined the DNA sequence of hundreds of such bacteria and cataloged more than 1,000 mutations caused by A3G. Weilong Hao, Ph.D., assistant professor of biological sciences at Wayne State, later analyzed the mutations, and noticed that when A3G was in the cells, C's in the LGST were replaced with T's three to four times the frequency at which they were getting replaced in the LDST. Statistical analysis of the data showed that this occurrence was extremely unlikely to happen by chance, which means that APOBEC3 enzymes must target the LGST. Cancer is often called a genetic disease because nearly all cancer-causing agents cause mutations. When the DNA sequence of breast tumors and other cancers was recently determined, C to T were the most frequently found mutations. These mutations were often found in clusters, suggesting that large stretches of DNA must become damaged in a single mutational event. ""These mutations had the signature of mutations caused by APOBEC3 enzymes, but it was unclear where these enzymes found the necessary long stretches of single-stranded DNA to mutate,"" said Bhagwat. ""The work by our collaborative team has shown that during the copying of DNA, the LGST strand of DNA is accessible to APOBECs and this causes the mutations."" According to Bhagwat, bacteria like E. coli display a phenomenon called ""GC skew"" that is related to this discovery. Bacterial DNA typically has fewer C's in LGST than G's. In light of the results of work by WSU/IU scientists, this observation can be explained at the molecular level. Bacteria do not naturally contain APOBEC3 enzymes, but water and other cellular chemicals can also cause C to T mutations. However, they do so at a very slow rate compared to APOBECs. Despite this slowness, the bacteria have replaced many of the C's in their LGST with T's over millions of years of evolution, creating the GC skew. Thus, the act of copying DNA, which is essential to life, drives both microbial evolution and cancer development. ""Our results could have a great impact on identifying the source of mutations in many cancers and perhaps tailoring treatments based on this information,"" said Bhagwat. ""Only some tumors have APOBEC mutational signatures and these can be identified using current DNA sequencing technology. Eventually, we may be able to treat these cancers in their early stages to prevent mutations caused by APOBEC3s."" ""This study is a beautiful example of how the power of bioinformatics and genomics is valuable in addressing important biological questions,"" said Hao. ""It has potential to make a positive impact on the health outcomes of people with cancer and possibly other diseases in the near future.""","Published: February 11, 2016"

Tight regulation of the level of SAMe is essential for maintaining a healthy cell and dysregulation of SAMe is considered important in many diseases including liver and colon cancer. The international team, which includes researchers from the Center for Cooperative Research in Biosciences, Spain, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, used X-ray crystallography to successfully unravel how the catalytic subunit MAT 2 synthesises SAMe, with details of every atom's location and behaviour as the synthesis takes place.

When the scientists used the technique to analyze the whole genome sequences of five individuals, they found that a person with narcolepsy had mutations in the regulatory regions of genes controlling alertness; a person with a family history of sudden cardiac death had mutations in regions controlling genes associated with cardiac output; and a person with high blood pressure had mutations in regions controlling circulating sodium levels in the blood.  The beauty of having whole genomes available for study is that you can then ask completely agnostic questions,  said Gill Bejerano, PhD, an associate professor of developmental biology, of pediatrics and of computer science at Stanford.  We set out to find hidden layers of susceptibility in the regulatory regions of these genomes. We were very pleased that our analysis gave such clear and significant associations between the mutations and medical histories.  Bejerano, a genomicist who is a member of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab, Child Health Research Institute, Neurosciences Institute, Cancer Institute and Bio-X, is the senior author of a paper describing the research. The first author is Harendra Guturu, PhD, a former Stanford graduate student who is now a research associate in pediatrics at the university.  Importance of regulatory regions The researchers focused their analyses on a relatively small proportion of each person s genome   the sequences of regulatory regions that have been faithfully conserved among many species over millions of years of evolution. Proteins called transcription factors bind to regulatory regions to control when, where and how genes are expressed. Some regulatory regions have evolved to generate species-specific differences   for example, mutating in a way that affects the expression of a gene involved in foot anatomy in humans   while other regions have stayed mostly the same for millennia.  In these cases, evolution has given a clear signal that these regions are important to key biological pathways, and it s important for them to stick around,  said Bejerano. All of us have some natural variation in our genome, accumulated through botched DNA replication, chemical mutation and simple errors that arise when each cell tries to successfully copy 3 billion nucleotides prior to each cell division. When these errors occur in our sperm or egg cells, they are passed to our children and perhaps grandchildren. These variations, called polymorphisms, are usually, but not always, harmless. GREAT work Guturu looked for what are called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, in the DNA of five people who have made their genomes and information about their own or their family s medical history publicly available for use by researchers worldwide. SNPs are places along a chromosome where the DNA sequence varies from a composite human DNA reference sequence by one letter, or nucleotide. This study shows that nature, even the noncoding genome, can be very benevolent when you ask the right questions. Rather than search through the whole genome, Guturu focused on SNPs in evolutionarily conserved regulatory regions. Even within these regions, each person had many SNPs. So Guturu used a software program, Predicting Regulatory Information of Single Motifs, developed in the Bejerano lab, to predict which nucleotide changes were likely to disrupt the conserved binding of a transcription factor. Guturu then turned to software called Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool to determine whether the disrupted binding sites were likely to perturb the expression of groups of genes that together control a particular biological function. GREAT, which was also developed in the Bejerano lab, curates knowledge about the diverse functions of thousands of different groups of genes. For any set of genomic regions a user inputs, GREAT determines the most common set or sets of nearby genes. Using this approach to study the genomes of the five individuals, Guturu, Bejerano and their colleagues found that one of the individuals who had a family history of sudden cardiac death had a surprising accumulation of variants associated with  abnormal cardiac output ; another with hypertension had variants likely to affect genes involved in circulating sodium levels; and another with narcolepsy had variants affecting parasympathetic nervous system development. In all five cases, GREAT reported results that jibed with what was known about that individual s self-reported medical history, and that were rarely seen in the more than 1,000 other genomes used as controls.  Exciting avenue for study  The researchers would like to create a web portal that would allow others to easily conduct similar studies. However, they concede that, for some diseases, the results may not be so clear-cut.  We are the sum of billions of transcription-factor-binding events in thousands of cell types throughout our bodies,  said Bejerano.  Not every disease will be amenable to this type of analysis. But this study shows that nature, even the noncoding genome, can be very benevolent when you ask the right questions. And it may help us begin to combine our knowledge about variations, or mutations, that occur throughout the genome. It s a very exciting avenue for study.  The research is an example of Stanford Medicine s focus on precision health, the goal of which is to anticipate and prevent disease in the healthy and precisely diagnose and treat disease in the ill.","Published: February 11, 2016"

RNA is both the molecular bridge between DNA and the production of proteins that carry out the functions of life and the molecular toolbox that collectively helps those proteins do their work. As such, RNA exists in a variety of forms, each with a particular role and purpose, not all of which are fully understood. Using the new method to shed additional light on the role of RNAs in cells, the team identified RNA variants in mammals that had been largely invisible to previous techniques. The researchers also demonstrated that these  dark  variations in RNA are strikingly common in mammalian cells and likely have roles in gene regulation across tissues, development, and in human diseases. The team plans to perform the analyses using the now-free software to interrogate aberrant cells in neurodegenerative disorders, cancers, and other illnesses.  It s very exciting for us, and I think for the research community in general, among other reasons, because we can now go back through the vast amount of existing transcriptome data, knowing that new and important things will emerge,  said senior author Yoseph Barash, PhD, an assistant professor of Genetics. Barash is also a senior fellow at the Penn Institute for Biomedical Informatics. An Incomplete Picture Barash s laboratory has been devoted principally to the study of RNA transcripts and their variations by using machine learning and computational modeling. One major mechanism of variation, called alternative splicing, has been known to scientists since the 1970s. When a protein-coding gene is first transcribed into RNA, cellular machinery slices the fresh RNA transcript into segments. It then discards non-protein-coding segments (introns) and splices back together protein-coding segments (exons) into a finished transcript of messenger-RNA, which is later translated into a protein. Sometimes, depending on circumstances in the cell, the splicing machinery deliberately omits splicing in one or more exons, and the result is a shorter messenger-RNA transcript, which in turn codes for a different form of the protein. In this way, a single gene may code for multiple forms of the same protein, each of which has its own distinct biological role, for example working only in one set of cell types or only during fetal development. Splicing patterns that deviate from normal are known to contribute to many diseases. A long-standing problem for biologists has been that they have no easy, error-free way to identify and quantify all the distinct messenger-RNA splice variants in a sample. Modern RNA-sequencing technology (RNA-seq) is a powerful scientific tool but mostly yields the sequences only of fragments of messenger RNAs. Those fragment sequences essentially have to be stitched back together, with the aid of sophisticated software and existing RNA databases, to get a complete picture of the transcriptome. But that picture isn t necessarily a complete one.  The reads from RNA-seq are sparse and also short compared to actual messenger-RNA transcripts, so you don t directly know what transcripts those reads came from,  Barash said.  Therefore you also don t directly know the abundance of those transcripts.  A New View of the Transcriptome The new approach devised by Barash and his team begins with the mapping of what they call local splice variations (LSVs) essentially the variable junctions between exons, which are detectable sequences that span more than one exon.  These are places where the splicing machinery of a cell makes a choice about which exon is spliced to another,  Barash said. The team developed software to generate LSV maps from RNA-seq data and combine those data with existing RNA databases to yield pictures that include ordinary, known splice variants, as well as complex splice variants that other methods fail to detect. To gauge the importance of the hitherto-unseen part of the transcriptome, the team used the new MAJIQ software (Modeling Alternative Junction Inclusion Quantification) to analyze RNA-seq data from a variety of species including lizards, mice, and humans. The analysis revealed that complex splice variants are much more common than previously thought comprising, for example, about 37 percent of the transcriptome variations in human samples.  These variations are a bit like the dark side of the moon,  said Barash.  They were known to exist, yet we lacked the ability to shine a light on them -- and now they turn out to make up a third of the variations in human messenger RNAs.  The complex splicing variants detected with MAJIQ included a highly conserved, yet previously unreported variant from the gene Ptbp1, which is known to be critical for proper brain development. Further analysis suggested that the newly discovered variant is involved in controlling the expression of Ptbp1 after birthby introducing a  poison exon  which marks the transcript to subsequent degradation. Another complex variant detected with MAJIQ, from the human, synapse-related gene CAMK2D, turned out to be expressed about 40 percent less in brain tissue from Alzheimer s patients, compared to controls. The team later found a similar drop in a second, larger RNA-seq dataset, also from Alzheimer s disease cases. Overall, the team identified approximately 200 cases of altered splicing in Alzheimer patients that were reproducible in the two independent studies.  We think that findings like those are just the tip of the iceberg,  Barash said. He and his colleagues now plan to do further MAJIQ-based investigations of complex splice variants in other disorders. However, Barash emphasizes that the MAJIQ software package will now be freely available for other academic researchers, who will all be able to use it in their own ways. In addition to MAJIQ, the team also has produced a complementary software package, VOILA, which enables researchers to visualize the complex splice variants detected by MAJIQ.","Published: February 11, 2016"

The discovery provides scientists with critical information regarding the best method for creating stem cells for regenerative medicine purposes, such as cell transplantation or organ regeneration. The discovery also provides insight into how information that is passed from an unfertilized egg to an embryo may impact the quality of the embryo and subsequently, the birth of healthy children. The research focuses on DNA methylation   a biochemical process that occurs naturally in DNA   in the early embryo and in stem cells created from embryos.  DNA methylation plays a role in how genetic information is used in the body. Correct DNA methylation of particular genes is critical for normal human development, and it remains critical in maintaining healthy cells throughout a person s lifespan. It also helps maintain an embryonic stem cell s ability to develop into any cell in the body. The researchers made two important discoveries about DNA methylation. First, they discovered that an early-stage embryo, or blastocyst, retains the DNA methylation pattern from the egg for at least six days after fertilization. Prior to this discovery, scientists thought that methylation memory from the egg was only retained for a few hours after fertilization.  We know that the six days after fertilization is a very critical time in human development, with many changes happening within that period,  said Amander Clark, the study s lead author and a professor and vice chair of molecular, cell and developmental biology in the life sciences at UCLA.  It s not clear yet why the blastocyst retains methylation during this time period or what purpose it serves, but this finding opens up new areas of investigation into how methylation patterns built in the egg affect embryo quality and the birth of healthy children.  The team s second discovery reveals that using a recently adopted method to derive stem cells from embryos in a petri dish results in loss of methylation. In the early embryo, the blastocyst stage of development lasts for less than five days. The less mature human embryonic cells that exist at the beginning of blastocyst development are called  na ve  embryonic cells. It is thought that at the time of implantation, these na ve embryonic cells reach a more mature state. They are then called  primed  embryonic cells, because they are primed to become every cell type in the body. In 1998, when the first human embryonic stem cells were derived, scientists used a method that created primed stem cells. This was the standard method until recently, when scientists started using a different method that preserves the na ve stem cell state.  In the past three years, na ve stem cells have been touted as potentially superior to primed cells,  Clark said.  But our data show that the na ve method for creating stem cells results in cells that have problems, including the loss of methylation from important places in DNA. Therefore, until we have a way to create more stable na ve embryonic stem cells, the embryonic stem cells created for the purposes of regenerative medicine should be in a primed state in order to create the highest-quality cells for differentiation.  The two other UCLA Broad Stem Cell Research Center faculty members who collaborated on the study are Kathrin Plath, professor of biological chemistry in UCLA Life Sciences; and Steven Jacobsen, professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology in UCLA Life Sciences and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. To further this research, Clark and Plath plan to work together to determine the optimal conditions for creating na ve embryonic stem cells that are more stable and retain methylation at places in the genome where it is most needed. All human embryonic stem cells derived at the UCLA Broad Stem Cell Research Center are obtained from stored frozen embryos donated with informed consent by individuals or couples who have completed in vitro fertilization.","Published: February 11, 2016"

By sequencing genes in tumors, for example, scientists have learned what mutations are typically found in different cancer types. Genetic methods can also be used to survey which proteins are made in tumors. Yet this information provides only an indirect measure of how cancer cells operate. To really capture that, you need to know about the dynamic chemical changes occurring in these cells; you need to know about cancer metabolism. Tracing the products of cell metabolism, known as metabolites, is not easy to do.  Looking at metabolites in cancer has been very difficult because the technology was not available,  says James Hsieh, a physician-scientist at Memorial Sloan Kettering and an expert in kidney cancer.  Until recently, we didn t have the capacity to look at hundreds, even thousands, of different metabolites inside of cells.  But with advanced biochemical methods, these myriad metabolites are finally coming into focus. Dr. Hsieh s team has used such methods to profile metabolic changes in hundreds of kidney cancer tumor samples. What s more, they ve developed a new online tool that will help researchers make sense of this vast data pool, highlighting previously unknown connections between metabolism and clear cell renal cell carcinoma   the most common, lethal form of the disease. Metabolism Explained Think of a cell as a factory. If genes provide the floor plan for the factory, and proteins make up the built environment, then metabolism is the movement of materials through the factory to make products. For many years, investigators wanting to understand cancer metabolism looked at enzyme levels   proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. Publically accessible databases, such as those maintained by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), provide this information. The problem is that enzyme levels don t necessarily tell you whether, and at what rate, metabolites are actually being made.  There s no good way to infer how changes in metabolite levels are connected to enzyme levels,  says Ed Reznik, a postdoctoral fellow in computational biology at the Sloan Kettering Institute who is a co-first author on the study.  You really have to go after the metabolites directly.  (To continue the factory analogy, just because a forklift is present on the shop floor doesn t mean it s being used.) If genes provide the floor plan for the factory, and proteins make up the built environment, then metabolism is the movement of materials through the factory to make products. To track metabolites, the team obtained samples of tumor tissue and normal tissue from 138 clear cell kidney cancer patients treated at MSK. A surgeon on the team and the paper s other co-first author, Ari Hakimi, performed these operations. The researchers then used mass spectrometry and liquid and gas chromatography to analyze the levels of more than 800 different metabolites in these samples. By comparing the levels of metabolites in tumors with those in normal tissues, they were able to chart the rise and fall of these chemicals. There s an App for That Making sense of the metabolic data was challenging at first, since there was so much of it.  If you look at human metabolism, there are upward of 5,000 distinct biochemical reactions,  says Dr. Reznik.  It s really hard to make sense of that in a way that humans can parse.  So the team decided to build a tool that would help them visualize what was going on. Working with a team of programmers, Dr. Reznik developed what he calls a  metabologram,  which allows users to review the metabolite data for any number of different metabolic pathways, one pathway at a time. Users can compare metabolites between tumor samples and normal samples, or between lower-stage tumors and higher-stage tumors. They can also see how the metabolic data line up against the gene expression data obtained from TCGA.   With the help of their new tool, the team made some startling discoveries. They found that the genetic data from TCGA were not always reflective of what was happening to metabolites in kidney cancer cells, and that the metabolic data help to make better sense of the clinical behavior of kidney cancer tumors.  Our data are actually much more consistent with the human data obtained from pathology,  Dr. Hsieh says. Charting Aggressiveness Taking a bird s-eye view of the metabolic data, the team found four distinct groupings, or clusters, of tumor samples that they could distinguish based on levels of metabolites. The clusters differed in their level of tumor aggressiveness and highlighted who the high-risk patients were.  You can use the metabologram to get a sense of what s driving the aggressive tumors from a metabolic standpoint,  Dr. Hakimi says. Once you have that, you can then think about ways to target that altered metabolism.  The team hopes that the new tool, which is being made freely available online, will help researchers generate novel hypotheses about metabolism and kidney cancer, and even encourage other teams to create metabolograms for other cancer types.  The goal is ultimately to use this information to improve clinical prediction for kidney cancer and to understand how best to treat it,  Dr. Hsieh says.","Published: February 11, 2016"

The move by the company comes as the announcement of the EU Falsified Medicines Directive (EUFMD) Safety Features Delegated Regulation is released. This means that the serialisation of licensed drug products will be a legal requirement for companies in the EU from early 2019. Recipharm already provides serialised products in markets including Turkey, Korea and China. A newly established, dedicated global steering committee will now also work closely with clients in Europe to ensure they plan and implement changes that comply with pending regulatory requirements for drug serialisation. The CDMO s company-wide serialisation project is being led by Staffan Widengren, Director Corporate Projects at Recipharm. He said:  Having worked with many clients in Asia on track and traceability, we know the complications and challenges of serialising a product from start to finish. The process can be complex and time consuming, particularly if the right tools and expertise are not in place, so we need to move this issue up the agenda for firms in Europe . He added:  We know that several pharmaceutical companies are behind in their preparations, mainly because the changes seem so far away. In reality, these organizations must look ahead and face this issue head on as changes take a long time to implement in a complex supply chain.  As a company, we are aiming to be as proactive as possible with the introduction of serialisation in order to support and advise our clients, create a clear strategy and prepare them for inevitable changes. If companies are underprepared, the new requirements have the potential to significantly impact their product supply. As a result, we expect to see increased demand for specialist outsourced services as the deadline looms ever closer.  The industry-wide serialisation, aggregation and verification directive is expected to improve traceability of drugs, help in the fight against counterfeit products entering the supply chain and ultimately improve patient safety. However, the implementation of required changes to the 2D barcodes on all saleable drug items is set to require significant investment from the pharmaceutical industry. Recipharm serves 250+ customers and expects 85% of its production to require serialisation. The CDMO will also be ready for US serialisation from November 2017 in-line with the US Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). Kjell Johansson, President Manufacturing Services Europe, commented:  The task force we have established at Recipharm will drive this project across all of our sites to ensure we support clients in terms of education and readiness for the changes ahead. Ultimately, our aim is to use our expertise to guide clients through this process and add as much value as possible. At the same time, we will work with our customers to minimise the cost implications.   Over the next few months, we will be consulting with our customers about payment models and the most efficient way to incorporate the cost of serialisation into their projects in both the short and long term."" Recipharm is preparing a range of educational papers aimed at training staff internally across its global network and supporting customers with the challenges of serialisation, verification and complying with new regulatory requirements.","Published: February 11, 2016"

These results came from a study funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), part of the National Institutes of Health. The 24/7 Sobriety program, launched in South Dakota in 2005, was associated with a 4.2 percent decrease in all-cause mortality over six years, with the largest reductions occurring among women and individuals over 40. Deaths from circulatory conditions, which include heart disease and stroke, declined significantly. ""The study suggests that effective programs for alcohol-involved offenders may have benefits, not only for the participants themselves, but for the community as a whole,"" said George F. Koob, Ph.D., NIAAA director. ""If these results are replicated in future studies, it could advance our understanding of how interventions within the criminal justice system can be used to improve public health."" The analysis was conducted by Nancy Nicosia, Ph.D., Beau Kilmer, Ph.D., and Paul Heaton, Ph.D., of the RAND Corporation. Results appear online in The Lancet Psychiatry. As part of the 24/7 Sobriety Program, people convicted of an alcohol-related offense must submit to twice-a-day breathalyzer tests or wear a continuous alcohol monitoring bracelet. Any violation is met with a swift, certain, and modest sanction; people who fail or skip tests immediately receive a short jail term, typically one to two days for a failed test. Nearly 3 percent of South Dakota's adult population (about 17,000 people) participated in 24/7 Sobriety between January 2005 and June 2011. Most people were placed in the program as a result of an arrest and conviction of driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. Researchers analyzed county-level mortality data from 2000 to 2011, making statistical adjustments for several factors, such as county demographics, unemployment rates, snowfall, police per capita, and bars per capita. Researchers were aided by the fact that different counties implemented 24/7 Sobriety at different points in time. The methods used in this study are stronger than simple cross-sectional studies that take data from a sample population at one point in time. Cross-sectional studies show correlation and cannot confirm any cause-and-effect relationship. In the present study, however, the researchers were able to compare within-county changes in mortality to within-county implementation of 24/7 Sobriety. This ""differences-in-differences"" statistical design provides substantial evidence of a causal relationship between the program and decreased mortality rates. The study authors were surprised at the magnitude of the drop in mortality associated with 24/7 Sobriety and point to the need for additional research to understand the extent of the relationship and the possible underlying causes. The researchers note that some of the reductions in mortality may reflect spillover effects onto nonparticipants, such as spouses, friends, and others who may be affected by changes in drinking behavior of those enrolled in the program. Previous studies have indicated that spouses sometimes reduce their drinking as a result of reductions in their partners' consumption. 24/7 Sobriety represents a promising alternate approach to preventing drunk driving. While other criminal justice interventions often focus on separating drinking and driving, 24/7 Sobriety attempts to manage the drinking itself. Technological advances such as remote alcohol monitoring in real time, coupled with the ability to transmit data electronically, are creating greater possibilities for these newer approaches.","Published: February 11, 2016"

They found that it is possible to turn a neuron which previously hasn t responded to placebos (placebo  non-responder  neuron) into a placebo  responder  by conditioning Parkinson patients with apomorphine, a dopaminergic drug used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD).  See Also: New lead for potential Parkinson s treatment When a placebo (saline solution) was given for the first time, it induced neither clinical benefit nor associated neuronal changes in the thalamus, a brain region known to be involved in PD. However, if repeated administrations of apomorphine were performed before placebo administration, a placebo was capable of increasing thalamus neuronal activity along with clinical improvement (reduction of muscle rigidity). Interestingly, the higher the previous administrations of apomorphine was, the larger the neuronal changes and the clinical improvement. When apomorphine was administered for 4 days in a row, the subsequent administration of a placebo induced a response that was as large as the one induced by apomorphine. These changes lasted for 24 hours. The researchers administered apomorphine, either 1, 2, 3 or 4 days before the surgical implantation of electrodes for deep brain stimulation, which is an effective treatment for PD. During surgery, they replaced apomorphine with a placebo and recorded from single neurons in the thalamus along with the assessment of muscle rigidity of the arm. Fabrizio Benedetti, from the Department of Neuroscience at University of Turin Medical School, Italy and first author of the study, explained, Learn More: Study Confirms Parkinson's Enhances Creativity  These findings show that is possible to teach neurons in the thalamus to respond to placebos, so that a placebo non-responder can be turned into a placebo responder. These findings may have profound implications and applications, because we can reduce drug intake by exploiting these learning mechanisms. Since this study shows that there is a memory for drug action, the alternate administration drug-placebo-drug- placebo etc. means people would need to take less medication but yet obtain the same clinical benefit.  If a placebo is given after four previous administrations of apomorphine, the placebo response can be as large as the drug response, and this effect lasts up to 24 hours. Therefore, a future challenge will be to see whether this effect can be extended beyond 24 hours.  The Physiological Society  press release Benedetti F et al.

In a paper recently published in Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, scientists describe how marijuana use, and the age at which use is initiated, may adversely alter brain structures that underlie higher order thinking. Findings show study participants who began using marijuana at the age of 16 or younger demonstrated brain variations that indicate arrested brain development in the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for judgment, reasoning and complex thinking. Individuals who started using marijuana after age 16 showed the opposite effect and demonstrated signs of accelerated brain aging. See Also: Researchers study differences in ischemic stroke in marijuana users ""Science has shown us that changes in the brain occurring during adolescence are complex. Our findings suggest that the timing of cannabis use can result in very disparate patterns of effects,"" explained Francesca Filbey, PhD, principal investigator and Bert Moore Chair of Behavioral and Brain Sciences at the Center for BrainHealth. ""Not only did age of use impact the brain changes but the amount of cannabis used also influenced the extent of altered brain maturation."" The research team analyzed MRI scans of 42 heavy marijuana users; twenty participants were categorized as early onset users with a mean age of 13.18 and 22 were labeled as late onset users with a mean age of 16.9. According to self-reports, all participants, ages 21-50, began using marijuana during adolescence and continued throughout adulthood, using cannabis at least one time per week. According to Filbey, in typical adolescent brain development, the brain prunes neurons, which results in reduced cortical thickness and greater gray and white matter contrast. Typical pruning also leads to increased gyrification, which is the addition of wrinkles or folds on the brain's surface. However, in this study, MRI results reveal that the more marijuana early onset users consumed, the greater their cortical thickness, the less gray and white matter contrast, and the less intricate the gyrification, as compared to late onset users. These three indexes indicate that when participants began using marijuana before age 16, the extent of brain alteration was directly proportionate to the number of weekly marijuana use in years and grams consumed. Contrastingly, those who began using marijuana after age 16 showed brain change that would normally manifest later in life: thinner cortical thickness, stronger gray and white matter contrast. Learn More: Study shows medical marijuana decreases migraines ""In the early onset group, we found that how many times an individual uses and the amount of marijuana used strongly relates to the degree to which brain development does not follow the normal pruning pattern.

These findings are in line with the current literature that suggest that cannabis use during adolescence can have long-term consequences,"" said Filbey. Filbey notes that a longitudinal study would be necessary to establish a causal relationship between brain alterations and marijuana use. Her future studies will explore cognitive and behavioral changes associated with structural brain change and consider the different patterns of development within the adolescent period and how these patterns could lead to non-linear effects.

Boosting intrinsic growth programs can dramatically augment the axon regeneration of injured neurons. If injured neurons can regenerate sufficient number of axons, the CNS may recover and overcome such functional deficits. In recent research, scientists from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) demonstrated that axon regenerative capacity can be boosted with the right stimulants on neuronal activity through either an optogenetic or a chemogenetic approach. They found that overexpression of a photopigment, melanopsin, in retinas could enhance neuronal firing of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and promote axonal regeneration after optic nerve crush by activating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Axon regeneration can also be promoted by activating Gq signaling in RGCs through Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD), wildly adopted as a tool to increase neuronal activity. See Also: Nerve cells use each other as maps Led by Kai Liu, the study's senior author and assistant professor in life sciences at HKUST, the research team started the investigation on mice by overexpressing melanopsin in RGCs using adeno-associated virus (AAV) to determine whether melanopsin could promote axonal regeneration. Axonal regeneration was evident after two weeks, and the effect was found to be stimulated by light and neuronal firing, which enhanced and maintained mTOR signaling. To mimic the downstream pathway of melanopsin and also stimulate neuronal activity through a different method, the researchers took a chemogenetic approach by injecting AAVs expressing DREADD-Gq into the eyes of the mice. A significant increase in axonal growth was detected as well after daily administration of a synthetic agonist clozapine-n-oxide. ""Our results show that melanopsin boosts axon regeneration by enhancing mTORC1 in a neuronal activity-dependent manner,"" Liu said.

My thought was, what if we could  weld  it back up right after it s injured? To conduct the study, two neurons, put in a special solution that prevents them from sticking together, were brought into contact with each other. Femtosecond laser pulses each ultrashort pulse occurring every 10-15 seconds were delivered to the meeting point of the two cells. Although the outside layer of the cells was partially compromised, the inside of that protective layer remained intact. As a result, the two cells established solid bonds forming a common membrane at the targeted area. Throughout multiple experiments, the cells remained viable and the connection strong. It took the neurons 15 milliseconds to stick to each other the process would have taken hours to occur naturally. The biggest advantage of the discovery is that it gives researchers complete control on the cell connection process.  You can really plan any experiment. The idea is to show that you can use it (femtosecond laser) as a research tool to control what you are attaching,  said Katchinskiy.

But it brings you closer to how these things work.  So far, the team has applied this method to three types of cells, but the potential of the technique seems limitless. For this project, Katchinskiy and Elezzabi, who are in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, teamed up with professor Roseline Godbout from the UAlberta's Department of Oncology and Cross Cancer Institute and Dr. Helly Goez, a professor in the division of pediatric neurology in the Department of Pediatrics at UAlberta's Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry.

The scientists studied proteins from yeast cells, which share many features with the cells of complex organisms such as humans, and could offer new insight into ways that DNA replication can go awry.  ""DNA replication is a major source of errors that can lead to cancer,"" explained Huilin Li, a biologist with a joint appointment at Brookhaven Lab and Stony Brook University and the lead author on a paper describing the new results in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology. ""The entire genome all 46 chromosomes gets replicated every few hours in dividing human cells,"" Li said, ""so studying the details of how this process works may help us understand how errors occur."" The research builds on previous work by Li and others, including last year's collaboration with the same team that produced the first-ever images of the complete DNA-copying protein complex, called the replisome. That study revealed a surprise about the location of the DNA-copying enzymes DNA polymerases. This new study zooms in on the atomic-level details of the ""helicase"" portion of the protein complex the part that encircles and splits the DNA double helix so the polymerases can synthesize two daughter strands by copying from the two separated parental strands of the ""twisted ladder.""  The scientists produced high-resolution images of the helicase using a technique known as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). One advantage of this method is that the proteins can be studied in solution, which is how they exist in the cells. ""You don't have to produce crystals that would lock the proteins in one position,"" Li said. That's important because the helicase is a molecular ""machine"" made of 11 connected proteins that must be flexible to work. ""You have to be able to see how the molecule moves to understand its function,"" Li said. The top movie shows the helicase protein complex from all angles, and reveals how its shape changes back and forth between two forms. The bottom movie shows how the rocking action of this conformational change might split the DNA double helix and move the helicase along one strand so it can be copied by DNA polymerase. Using computer software to sort out the images revealed that the helicase has two distinct conformations one with components stacked in a compact way, and one where part of the structure is tilted relative to a more ""fixed"" base.  The atomic-level view allowed the scientists to map out the locations of the individual amino acids that make up the helicase complex in each conformation. Then, combining those maps with existing biochemical knowledge, they came up with a mechanism for how the helicase works.  ""One part binds and releases energy from a molecule called ATP. It converts the chemical energy into a mechanical force that changes the shape of the helicase,"" Li said. After kicking out the spent ATP, the helicase complex goes back to its original shape so a new ATP molecule can come in and start the process again. ""It looks and operates similar to an old style pumpjack oil rig, with one part of the protein complex forming a stable platform, and another part rocking back and forth,"" Li said. Each rocking motion could nudge the DNA strands apart and move the helicase along the double helix in a linear fashion, he suggested. This linear translocation mechanism appears to be quite different from the way helicases are thought to operate in more primitive organisms such as bacteria, where the entire complex is believed to rotate around the DNA, Li said. But there is some biochemical evidence to support the idea of linear motion, including the fact that the helicase can still function even when the ATP hydrolysis activity of some, but not all, of the components is knocked out by mutation. ""We acknowledge that this proposal may be controversial and it is not really proven at this point, but the structure gives an indication of how this protein complex works and we are trying to make sense of it,"" he said.","Published: February 10, 2016"

The College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges to award Associate's degrees. In 2014, TCC's Board of Trustees together with the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board approved for the College to award Associate of Science degree in Chemistry. Graduates with an AS-Chemistry degree are qualified to seek employment opportunities as chemical laboratory technicians or they can continue their education in a four year university. As a result of this new degree approval and in order to provide students with hands on experience using modern analytical instrumentation (thus enhancing their technical expertise), the chemistry department decided to invest in the purchase of new spectrometers. At the start of the 2015 fall semester, budget was approved for the purchase of an NMR spectrometer. After extensive market research, the Department chose to purchase a Magritek Spinsolve benchtop system.  Chemistry Department Chairman, Dr Kaveh Azimi, and staff, are enthusiastic about their decision.  Faculty selected Spinsolve spectrometer for many reasons. Its compact size is ideal for a teaching laboratory where space is at a premium. Maintenance free operation thanks to the permanent magnet design means there is no need for cryogen fills saving valuable resources. The simplicity of sample preparation and the fact that the system uses standard 5 mm NMR sample tubes make this an ideal instrument for a teaching lab. The quality of spectra is excellent and to have the option of a 13C upgrade increases the value of this initial investment. Last, but not least, faculty and staff were most impressed by the knowledge, friendly demeanour, and professionalism of Randal Hall, Magritek's regional sales manager. Ultimately, it was Mr. Hall's assurance of Magritek's commitment to customer service and technical support that sealed the sale.  Spinsolve is being used primarily by students enrolled in the second semester organic chemistry course. Organic chemistry students are following experiments from the Molecular Laboratory Program in Chemistry. For example, to identify unknown aldehydes and ketones, students prepare NMR samples of their unknowns and use NMR spectroscopy as a qualitative method for structure confirmation. They are also carrying out some basic reaction monitoring experiments where students utilize the integration values of NMR peaks as a semi-quantitative analytical method to estimate the percent completion of a reaction. In addition, students perform NMR spectra interpretations to determine the chemical structures of unknowns and to characterize the products their reactions. Spinsolve is also being used for an undergraduate research project entitled Investigations into the Fatty Acid Composition of Commercially Available Dietary Fats.  Summarizing, Chemistry Department staff say,  We were  magnetized  by Spinsolve's simplicity of operation and the superior quality of spectral output during the hands-on instrument demonstration (high signal to noise and good peak resolution). The Spinsolve took us for a surprising spin!  Magritek's Spinsolve benchtop NMR spectrometer is supplied worldwide to academics in teaching and research; also to industry for research and reaction monitoring through to quality control use.","Published: February 10, 2016"

In a review[1] published late last week, researchers including the ESCMID network discussed the rapid spread of Zika virus in the Americas and concluded that the virus and other arboviruses may not only pose a threat to residents of Brazil, but also to attendees of the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic games in Rio de Janeiro. Meanwhile, ESCMID researchers are also working hard on the development of better diagnostic tools and on improving the monitoring of the virus  spread, as they are preparing for a possible outbreak in Europe and the return of the virus to the African continent where it was first isolated in the Zika Forest in Uganda in 1947. An international research team led by Prof. Eskild Petersen from Aarhus University in Denmark   executive committee member of the ESCMID Study Group on Infections in Travellers and Migrants (ESGITM)   and Prof. Alimuddin Zumla, University College London, United Kingdom, published the review on the Zika virus in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. The paper concludes that  molecular analyses of the virus are most urgently needed to understand whether a change in the virus can explain the rapid spread and the association with microcephaly in babies exposed to the virus during pregnancy.  Research into rapid diagnostics, treatments and vaccines are underway, the review authors said. Specific and rapid diagnostic tests for the virus will allow better surveillance and assessment of the risk for microcephaly, Guillain-Barr  syndrome, and other complications, Prof. Petersen explained.  The emergence of Zika virus soon after the Ebola outbreak is yet another reminder for the urgent need for a coordinated global effort to have sufficiently resourced rapid response groups for proactive surveillance and conduct of priority research in emergency situations,  Prof. Petersen concludes. Prof. Hakan Leblebicioglu, chairperson of ESGITM, added: ""Emerging and re-emerging infections usually arise from resource-limited countries and since the infrastructure for diagnostics is not well-established, the timely diagnosis and control of outbreaks are usually late. For this reason, an international collaboration for capacity building of the laboratories and technology transfer is essential."" ESGITM board member Dr. Nick Beeching from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine notes that Aedes mosquitoes are widespread in the tropics, including both Aedes aegypti, implicated in the outbreak in Latin America and Aedes albopictus, which is increasingly found in southern Europe. These mosquitoes are already responsible for huge epidemics of fevers due to dengue and chikungunya viruses in the tropics and for smaller outbreaks in Italy and France, so there may be potential for transmission of Zika in parts of Europe too. It is not known whether other types of mosquito that are more common in Europe can act as vectors for Zika virus and research on this is urgently needed. Dr. Beeching points out that only one in five people infected with the virus show any symptoms, so that many people will be unaware that they have been infected. He thinks it is very likely that the virus will return to sub-Saharan Africa soon, as it is already present in an archipelago just off the coast of Western Africa, in the island country Cape Verde.   The next stage for the virus might be to move from Cape Verde to Guinea-Bissau, and from there to neighbouring countries in West Africa. It could also be exported to Madeira, which is part of Europe, and which experienced a dengue fever outbreak in 2012, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes that were already established there.  Dr. Beeching speculates. One of the main questions to be answered is why the virus was able to spread so rapidly now and why such huge outbreaks did not occur before. The problem with current prevention techniques is that researchers are working with empirical and epidemiological data, and until the RNA of the virus is analyzed   which will take several months   we will not know if it is a mutation in the virus or other factors that play a role in the apparent increased occurrence of microcephaly and Guillain-Barr  syndrome in the affected regions, according to researchers. Investigations into the associations with central nervous system complications may prove particularly important, including follow-up of patients and babies born to infected mothers to detect other possible sequelae. For European residents there is an infection risk if they travel to affected countries or if they have unprotected sexual contact with someone who has recently returned from an affected area. There is also a risk from transfusion of blood donated by those recently infected. Perhaps more alarming would be if the virus manages to reach southern Europe. Experts are concerned that countries like France, Spain and Italy, which in the past have registered cases of dengue transmission, may be at risk.  Dr. Rogelio L pez-V lez, ESGITM member from the Spanish national referral centre for tropical medicine of the Hospital Ram n y Cajal in Madrid, added  Even in Brazil 25% of the cases of microcephaly showed no symptoms of Zika. If the virus spreads to Africa and Southern Europe, we urgently need rapid diagnostic tests and more information on how long the risk of microcephaly exists after infection. For now however, particularly among female migrants from South America or Europeans visiting Latin America, we need to ensure they remain vigilant when travelling between the two continents.  ESCMID researchers also support monitoring of the virus outbreak. The society is a partner in the PREPARE project, where researchers develop tools including clinical research protocols and case report forms, which are systematically used to collect essential data and laboratory results for clinical studies on the virus. In cooperation with PREPARE, ESCMID organizes an educational course entitled PREPAREing for (Re-)Emerging Arbovirus Infections in Europe from 7   9 March 2016 in Thessaloniki, Greece.","Published: February 10, 2016"

As part of their reliability testing system, confocal laser scanning microscopy provides valuable quantitative information, feeding back to optimise interconnect design in terms of both geometry and fabrication. This cutting edge research is available to view in a new online application note from Olympus.     Flexible electronic devices have a wealth of potential applications, from flexible phones to wearable chemical sensors. One design approach allowing such devices to withstand deformation is to overlay electrical components on a deformable substrate. These rigid components are connected via a flexible interconnect, and Dr Gastaldi s research is looking to optimise interconnect design, employing in situ mechanical reliability testing to analyse device behaviour under strain. This approach requires a high-resolution observation technique, and while SEM was previously employed, it failed to allow precise quantification of out-of-plane deformation.  Replacing SEM with the Olympus LEXT OLS4100 confocal laser scanning microscope, Dr Gastaldi s group has now benefited from many features, including the quantitative information from the height map and high lateral resolution. The LEXT OLS4100 delivers high precision optical metrology, and the researchers now have quantitative evidence supporting how particular geometries are more resistant to delamination, enhancing the design process through a numerical modelling system. In addition, crack formation can be followed in detail, and it has been shown that plasma treatment of polymers, while increasing adhesion may promote cracking.  I was impressed by the image quality, not to mention the quantitative information,  commented Dr Gastaldi.  The easy management of the LEXT allows us to focus our attention on our research.  Combining Olympus  digital light microscopy technology with mechanical testing, the Olympus LEXT OLS4100 offers possibilities throughout a vast field of applications across all sectors of material science.

The paper analyzed the DNA of Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), which are the strains of the bacteria that cause diarrhea. The scientists, led by David Rasko, PhD, Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) at UM SOM and Michael Donnenberg, MD, Professor of Medicine at UM SOM, identified certain strains that are typically much more lethal than others. The results will help researchers focus efforts to identify, treat and potentially control these more dangerous versions.  This could lead to a better understanding of exactly how the bacteria causes damage, and eventually, more effective treatments that could significantly lower the death rate for diarrheal diseases, which are a leading cause of child mortality around the world. Each year diarrhea kills around 760,000 children under five. It is also is a leading cause of malnutrition in children under five years old. Globally, there are nearly 1.7 billion cases of diarrheal disease every year.   These findings really help us map the associations between the bacteria and these illnesses in a new way. This kind of research would not have been possible a few years ago,  says Dr. Rasko.  But with new advances, we can make these kinds of exciting discoveries.  Rasko described the research as  genomic epidemiology,  a new way of doing public health science that integrates the most cutting-edge technologies with an extensive knowledge of the pathogenic bacteria, both of which exist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Dr. Rasko and his colleagues, including researchers in The Gambia, Mali, Kenya, Mozambique, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, examined the genomes of 70 strains of E. coli, which were obtained from infected children enrolled in the Global Enterics Multi-Center study (GEMS). Some of the cases were associated with death, others where had symptoms but no death, and others were not associated with symptoms; as a result, the scientists had access to strains with a range of outcomes. They analyzed the genetic differences between the strains and mapped them onto disease outcome. Then, they divided the strains into categories, based on genetic content and clinical outcome. They are not sure how the genetic variations may be linked to symptoms and outcomes, but the pattern provides a rich area for further research, Rasko said. He suspects that increased E. coli lethality is caused by a group of genes interacting rather than one or two genes.  This research epitomizes what IGS is all about,  says Claire M. Fraser, PhD, Director of IGS  We want to take genomics and use it in novel ways, ways that can be of practical use to clinicians around the world.  Over the past several years, IGS has increasingly taken a larger role in the study of the genetics of infectious disease. In 2014, it was awarded a five-year, $15.2 million grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to develop the Genome Center for Infectious Disease.   This work by Dr. Rasko and his colleagues is on the cutting edge of how scientists can use data and genomics to get at difficult public health questions,  says UM SOM Dean E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, who is also Vice President of Medical Affairs at the University of Maryland and the John Z. and Akiko Bowers Distinguished Professor at UM SOM.  I am confident that they will continue to identify crucial leads in our fight to improve the lives of people around the world suffering from disease. ","Published: February 10, 2016"

Maerl hosts a high diversity of organisms by providing habitats, shelter and nursery areas for, amongst others, fish larvae and young scallops.  Both coralline algae and the maerl beds they generate are protected by national and international regulation as they form biodiversity hotspots and support fisheries. The skeletal structure of coralline algae is composed of high- magnesium calcite, the most soluble form of calcium carbonate, and is therefore potentially vulnerable to the change in carbonate chemistry resulting from the absorption of man-made CO2 by the ocean. Previous Bristol-led research has shown that ocean acidification affects coralline algae by reducing the thickness of their cell walls and thus their structural strength, crucial for withstanding natural stresses such as wave movement or grazing.  It also showed that, given enough time, the algae can acclimatise and continue to grow. In a new study Dr Federica Ragazzola and colleagues assessed this new growth to see whether it is of the same quality as before and hence whether coralline algae are able to grow as strong a skeleton under climate change conditions. The strength of this skeletal structure is important as it impacts the ability of alga to provide shelter for other species. The researchers found that, under ocean acidification, the chemical composition of the skeleton is changing, making it potentially more brittle. Professor Daniela Schmidt, Head of Global Change at the Cabot Institute and senior author of the study said:  Our research suggests that in the near future these organisms are not sufficiently calcified to provide habitat for other species.  Coralline algae support a huge variety of marine life, with more than 460 species associated with their beds including economically important species such as scallops.  While a number of studies have now shown that coralline algae can continue to grow even in challenging environmental conditions, it is fundamentally important that we combine these physiological studies with potential impacts on the structural integrity of the skeleton and its consequences to habitat formation.

""It typically takes about 12 years and $1.8 billion to produce one FDA-approved drug,"" said Shaochen Chen, NanoEngineering professor at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering. ""That's because over 90 percent of drugs don't pass animal tests or human clinical trials. We've made a tool that pharmaceutical companies could use to do pilot studies on their new drugs, and they won't have to wait until animal or human trials to test a drug's safety and efficacy on patients. This would let them focus on the most promising drug candidates earlier on in the process."" Chen and Shu Chien, a professor of Medicine and Bioengineering, director of the Institute of Engineering in Medicine at UC San Diego and recipient of a National Medal of Science, are co-senior authors of the study. The liver plays a critical role in how the body metabolizes drugs and produces key proteins. This is why liver models are increasingly being developed in the lab as platforms for drug screening. However, existing models so far lack both the complex micro-architecture and diverse cell makeup of a real liver. The UC San Diego team engineered a human liver tissue model that more closely resembles the real thing--a diverse combination of liver cells and supporting cells systematically organized in a hexagonal pattern. ""We've engineered a functioning liver tissue that matches what you'd see under a microscope,"" said Chen. ""The liver is unique in that it receives a dual blood supply with different pressures and chemical constituents. Our model has the potential of reproducing this intricate blood supply system, thus providing unprecedented understanding of the complex coupling between circulation and metabolic functions of the liver in health and disease,"" said Chien, who studies how blood flow and pressure affect blood vessels. To do this, the team employed a novel bioprinting technology developed in Chen's lab, which can rapidly produce complex 3D microstructures that mimic the sophisticated features found in biological tissues. The liver tissue was printed in two steps. First, the team printed a honeycomb pattern of 900-micrometer-sized hexagons, each containing liver cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. An advantage of human induced pluripotent stem cells is they are patient-specific, which makes them ideal materials for building patient-specific drug screening platforms. And since these cells are derived from a patient's skin cells, researchers don't need to extract any cells from the liver to build liver tissue. In the next step, endothelial and mesenchymal supporting cells were printed in the spaces between the stem-cell-containing hexagons. The entire structure--a 3   3 millimeter square, 200 micrometers thick--takes just seconds to print. This is a vast improvement over other methods to print liver models, which typically take hours. The structure was cultured in vitro for at least 20 days. The researchers then tested the resulting tissue's ability to perform various liver functions, such as albumin secretion and urea production, and compared it to other models. They found that their model was able to maintain these functions over a longer time period than other liver models. Their model also expressed a relatively higher level of a key enzyme that's considered to be involved in metabolizing many of the drugs administered to patients. ""I think that this will serve as a great drug screening tool for pharmaceutical companies and that our 3D bioprinting technology opens the door for patient-specific organ printing in the future,"" said Chen. ""The liver tissue constructed by this novel 3D printing technology will also be extremely useful in reproducing in vitro disease models such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and cancer,"" added Chien. ""Such realistic models will be invaluable for the study of the pathophysiology and metabolic abnormalities in these diseases and the efficacy of drug therapies.""","Published: February 10, 2016"

The possibility of using stem cells to replace damaged heart tissue following a heart attack has interested researchers for many years. Though stem cells transplanted into patients can develop into heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) and integrate with undamaged regions of cardiac tissue, several pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have failed to identify significant improvements in the contractile function of the heart. One explanation for this could be that mechanical forces are not transmitted properly between the new, stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and the old, surviving heart cells. The mechanical forces exchanged by cardiomyocytes are impossible to measure in patients. So, a team of researchers led by Professor Kit Parker at Harvard University developed a simplified, in vitro system in which single heart cells isolated from mice are combined with individual, stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to form a two-cell ""microtissue"" that the researchers call a ""muscle on-a-chip."" Using this approach, Pasqualini and Aratyn-Schaus, post-doctoral fellows in the Parker lab and co-first authors of the study, found that stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes could structurally couple, and synchronously beat with mouse cardiomyocytes. Stem cell-derived myocytes contracted less strongly than their partners, however, and this imbalance resulted in the cells transmitting mechanical forces to their surroundings, instead of to each other. Computer simulations revealed that the unequal forces generated by stem cell-derived and native cardiomyocytes are sufficient to induce the formation of cellular adhesions that can dissipate force to the cells' surroundings. The computer model also suggests that human cardiomyocytes are likely to behave similarly. Inefficient force transmission may therefore explain why stem cell transplantation has been somewhat ineffective in restoring normal heart function. Parker and colleagues' muscle on-a-chip technique should help researchers develop ways to improve the mechanical coupling of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to surviving heart tissue.","Published: February 10, 2016"

In the first study of its kind, student Zain Habib Alhindi used different concentrations of Surgihoney, a biologically engineered honey that produces chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen, to test how effective it could be in destroying the fungus Fusarium, which is found on plants and in soil and can cause devastating infections in vulnerable people. Zain discovered even the lowest concentrations had a significant effect in breaking down the cell wall of the fungus, demonstrating its potential as a future treatment for patients. She said:  Chronic infections, such as those found in long-lasting wounds comprise about 60-80 per cent of infectious diseases in humans and the way fungi invades wounds is associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.  However, we know that biofilms - thin layers of microorganisms, which group together - contribute to the severity and delayed healing of chronic wounds.  Through my research I wanted to show the potential for honey as a healing agent to break through these biofilms and in doing so increase the process of healing. What I found amazing is that honey actually works better than some antifungals.  In the world of increasing antimicrobial resistance new approaches to the management of infections, sparing the real antibiotics, are highly relevant and important. Zain (29) from Saudi Arabia is one of only handful of students who have completed The University s new master s degree course in Medical Mycology which runs for just one year instead of the customary two, making it a world first. Because of the way the course is structured Zain was able to spend almost a third of her time in the lab working on experiments to test her theory under the supervision of Dr Riina Rautemaa-Richardson, Senior Lecturer in Infectious Diseases in The University s Institute of Inflammation and Repair. Dr Rautemaa-Richardson believes it s this intensive, hands-on approach, which appeals to her students and equips them for a career in specialised medicine or research. She said:  This dynamic course provides a solid foundation to the scientific, practical and clinical aspects of fungal diseases, which allows clinically relevant research like this. In the world of increasing antimicrobial resistance new approaches to the management of infections, sparing the real antibiotics, are highly relevant and important.  Professor Malcolm Richardson, Professor of Medical Mycology at The University of Manchester added:  Honey has been used since ancient times for the treatment of several diseases. Only a limited number of investigations have looked at its effect on pathogenic fungi.  This opens an exciting door for further work on the application of honey for many fungal infections and allows researchers to adopt different options for treating a range of superficial infections.

The award of $3,044,950 will fund stem cell training for HSU students and support up to 10 paid research internships annually for the next five years. Interns are placed in universities with major stem cell research programs.HSU is partnered with labs at UC San Francisco, UC Davis, and Stanford University. Varkey and Sprowles received their first CIRM Bridges award in 2009. The award funded 70 HSU students who received extensive training in stem cell research at UC Davis, UC San Francisco, and Stanford over a seven-year period.  The goal of the Bridges program is to prepare undergraduate and master s level students in California for a successful career in stem cell research,  says Randy Mills, CIRM president and CEO.  That s not just a matter of giving them money, but also of giving them good mentors who can help train and guide them, of giving them meaningful engagement with patients and patient advocates, so they have a clear vision of the impact the work they are doing can have on people s lives.  HSU has a reputation of preparing highly qualified candidates for the CIRM program due, in part, to a rigorous selection process, which includes a complete stem cell training program.  Students enrolled in the courses that make up the training program are prepared to design and conduct experiments that address research questions in the field. This requires instruction in laboratory methods, fundamental scientific principles, and interpretation of the primary literature so they are current in the field of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine,  says Assistant Professor Amy Sprowles, who along with Biology Professor Jacob Varkey, directs HSU s CIRM Scholars program. Once students complete the stem cell training program, they are qualified to apply for HSU s CIRM 12-month paid internship, and to seek a position at one of three host institutions Stanford University, University of California Davis or University of California San Francisco.  We ve had students work on everything from brain cancer to spinal cord repair. After their internships, our students have gone on to pursue careers at the top research institutions in the world,  says Sprowles. In total, 48 students have completed the internship and represent a wide cross section of majors and backgrounds. Chemistry and Biology students study alongside Psychology students, and 35 percent of those are first-generation students. Nearly a quarter self-report as belonging to a demographic that is under-represented in science. One common trait is success  We are very proud of the fact that more than 90 percent of our trainees have found work in the field or have been accepted to highly competitive biomedical graduate or medical professional programs,  says Varkey. Hannah Collins ( 15, Biology) is 2014-15 CIRM scholar who interned at UC San Francisco. She says CIRMhas prepared her to look closely at career opportunities in regenerative medicine and stem cell biology.  CIRM is an opportunity to look into the future. Do you want to be a Ph.D.? Do you want to be in that highly competitive, high-impact world? Do you want to work at a lab bench or do you want to teach? CIRM helps you figure out where you re going,  says Collins. Wes Jenkins ( 14, Biology), who currently teaches two sections of the HSU cellular biology laboratory course, also completed the CIRM internship program through UC San Francisco in 2014-15. He credits the program with giving students a deep understanding of science.  You learn fundamental techniques in biology and in regenerative medicine. But more importantly, you get to learn how to think critically how to design an experiment and how to troubleshoot,  says Jenkins.","Published: February 10, 2016"

Understanding how the drug and protein interact at an atomic level can allow scientists to design new drugs to alter the target protein s function. A research team led by Dr. Sriram Subramaniam of NIH s National Cancer Institute (NCI) has been using an imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine atomic structures. Protein suspensions are flash-frozen at very low temperatures to quickly stabilize the water around proteins without allowing damaging ice crystals to form. The suspensions are then bombarded with electrons to capture images. The researchers computationally combine thousands of these 2-D images of the molecules in different orientations to produce 3-D structures. Cryo-EM has been gaining in popularity because it enables the visualization of specimens under near-native, or natural, conditions. The scientists have used cryo-EM to study a variety of molecules, including proteins and receptors found in brain cells. In their latest study, the team visualized the binding of a potential small molecule drug to a key enzyme in cancer cells. The enzyme, p97, is critical for protein quality control in the cell and a potential anti-cancer target.  Using cryo-EM, the researchers were able to image full-length p97 at an overall resolution of 2.3  , which is much finer than previous structural studies of p97 had achieved. The researchers were also able to establish, at atomic resolution, the sequence of structural changes that normally occur in the protein. The scientists determined the mode of binding and contact sites of a small molecule inhibitor of p97 activity. Rather than sitting in an active site binding pocket of the protein, the inhibitor wedges between the upper and lower halves of the protein. With the inhibitor in place, the protein can no longer undergo its normal ratchet-like rotational motion, instead locking up in a single position. These deductions about inhibitor action were only possible because cryo-EM was able to capture the whole protein in multiple conformations, or forms.  Our latest research provides new insights into the protein structures and interactions that are critical for the activity of a cancer cell, and this knowledge will hopefully enable the design of clinically useful drugs,  Subramaniam says.  Cryo-EM is positioned to become an even more useful tool in structural biology and cancer drug development,  says Dr. Douglas Lowy, acting director of NCI.  This latest finding provides a tantalizing possibility for advancing effective drug development. ","Published: February 10, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/unique-mechanism-for-a-highrisk-leukemia-212938,Unique Mechanism for a High Risk Leukemia Researchers uncovered the aberrant mechanism underlying a notoriously treatment resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia subtype  findings offer lessons for understanding all cancers  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A research team led by St. Jude Children s Research Hospital scientists has discovered details of how the abnormal breakage and rearrangement of chromosomes in white blood cells triggers a particularly aggressive form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Such leukemias are cancers of white blood cells, in which genetic mutations trigger overproduction of immature cells, called lymphoblasts. The discoveries of the malfunction underlying the type called  Ph-like ALL  will aid in designing treatments for the leukemia, researchers said, and also offer useful lessons for investigators studying similar leukemias and other types of cancer. Although the investigators had previously identified an abnormal chromosome rearrangement in Ph-like ALL, little was known about the biological effects of that rearrangement. Iacobucci and colleagues set out to pinpoint those effects by studying human leukemic cells and mouse cells engineered to mimic the disorder. Genomic analysis revealed the details of four distinctly different chromosomal rearrangements in the leukemia. All resulted in a truncated version of a gene called the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) gene, and all produced the same outcome driving the white blood cells to proliferate out of control. Li developed and applied the genomic analytical method used to define the truncations.  To our knowledge, this is a previously unknown mechanism for leukemia,  Mullighan said.  Our search of cancer genomic data has shown that there are many other examples of chromosomal rearrangements that alter genes  structure, but this type where a truncating rearrangement leads to activation is new.  In analysis of cells from patients with ALL, Iacobucci found the characteristic rearrangements in all the leukemic cells, suggesting these changes were fundamental to the development of cancer. And in experiments with mice, Iacobucci also showed that introducing the mutant receptor in blood cells gave rise to leukemia. Importantly, Iacobucci and collaborators found the chromosomal alterations arise early in the development of the leukemia and persist as the disease progresses.  That finding was important because it suggests that treatments for this leukemia targeting this receptor won t just impact a subset of the leukemia cells, allowing others to keep proliferating,  Iacobucci said. Mullighan said the group s findings will significantly aid design and testing of treatments for Ph-like ALL, including trials being developed by the Children s Oncology Group (COG) and St. Jude. The researchers expect that these trials will commence in the near future, because drugs that inhibit the over-activated biological pathway in the leukemia already exist and are widely used to treat other cancers. In fact, Iacobucci s experiments with both engineered mouse cells and human leukemic cells showed that using one of these drugs, ruxolitinib, inhibited the out-of-control machinery. The researchers also cited the case of an adult patient at MD Anderson Cancer Research Center, Houston, whose genetic analysis revealed EPOR-rearranged ALL. That patient had not responded significantly to other chemotherapy drugs, but when given ruxolitinib, showed a major drop in leukemia cells. In experiments with leukemic cells, Iacobucci also found that ruxolitinib worked synergistically to enhance the effectiveness of three widely used traditional chemotherapy drugs dexamethasone, vincristine and daunorubicin.  We think these findings provide a useful road map for planning more accurate testing of combination chemotherapies,  Mullighan said. Of the potential for aiding clinical trials, co-author Stephen Hunger, M.D., of Children s Hospital of Philadelphia, said:  These findings expand the number of ALL patients who should be amenable to precision medicine therapies that add targeted inhibitors to chemotherapy for ALL patents with specific genetic changes in the leukemia cells.  Hunger said COG has developed a clinical trial testing this strategy with ruxoltitinib, which will begin treating patients in mid-2016. Based on the results of this St. Jude-led study, he said, the trial will include children with ALL and EPOR rearrangements. COG is a federally supported clinical trials group focused exclusively on childhood cancer. More broadly, Mullighan said the findings highlight the complexity of the chromosomal rearrangements underlying the many types of ALL.  These findings drive home the point that we are dealing with a complex genomic landscape. Each one of these rearrangements is potentially its own entity, and each one merits its own detailed study. You can t just map a rearrangement and assume that it will produce the same mechanism in all patients that will yield to the same treatment,  Mullighan said, adding that  meticulous, detailed genetic sequencing of the cancer cell genomes is required to tease apart the subtle differences among closely related cancers. Such sequencing is also critical for definitive diagnosis of the cancers.  Mullighan emphasized the importance of such detailed analysis in all cancers.  Often a lot of that data generated by whole-genome sequencing may not have been mined comprehensively, because such rigorous analysis is very difficult. But to fully understand these tumors, you have to look at large numbers to make correlations; and to really understand the driving mechanism, you have to find the recurrent biological changes in the tumors.

A wide variety of drugs such as beta-blockers against high blood pressure or drugs against allergies, cancer, Parkinson's disease, HIV and others bind to cell surface proteins which belong to the family of G protein coupled receptors. The drug binding transmits a signal to the inside of the cell. Despite the fact that many structures of these receptors are known, it remained unclear how the signal is transmitted to the intracellular inside. To better understand the signal transduction function, Prof. Stephan Grzesiek's team at the Biozentrum of the University of Basel, together with researchers from the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) have studied in detail one receptor - the  1-adrenergic receptor. Using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR), the scientists have been able to follow the motions of this receptor in response to various drugs, and have thus obtained unprecedented detailed insights into the general mechanism of G protein coupled receptor function. Structural changes provide details on receptor function The  1-adrenergic receptor is a protein embedded in the membrane of cardiac cells. It translates the binding of extracellular drug molecules into the activation of intracellular proteins. The hormone noradrenaline, for example, induces a signaling cascade in the cell, which at the end increases heart rate and blood pressure. So-called beta-blockers impede these effects by preventing the hormone from binding to the adrenergic receptor. Thereby, they reduce the heart rate. Structural details of the signal transduction caused by such receptor-ligand interactions have so far remained unclear. ""We have applied high resolution NMR to analyze the structural changes of the  1-adrenergic receptor upon binding of various drugs"", explains first author Shin Isogai. ""We could observe how the receptor recognizes the binding partner, interprets its chemical structure and transmits this information to the inside of the cell by changing its structure. This insight into the functionality of the  1-adrenergic receptor at the atomic level can be applied to the whole family of G protein coupled receptors, which are well known as important drug targets."" Prediction of drug efficacy Using the NMR observation of the atomic nuclei, the scientists could see how deep the drugs insert into the receptor from the outside, how the drug pushes certain groups away and how it transmits this mechanical signal to the inside. Thus they identified crucial mechanical connections for the signal transmission within the receptor structure. The NMR signals also revealed the binding strength of the drugs and their potency to trigger an intracellular response. In fact, they could follow how a model protein for the intracellular response binds to the activated receptor. ""We are very happy that we could see these details. The receptors are notoriously difficult to study. Many researchers have tried for more than a decade"", emphasizes Isogai. ""Now we can apply this method to see the function of individual amino acids and to study other receptors."" In the future, the NMR method may also be used for drug screening and drug development.","Published: February 10, 2016"

""Using advanced nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we were able to provide an unprecedented view of the internal structure of the protein clumps that form in the disease, which we hope will one day lead to new therapies."" The gene associated with Huntington's makes a protein that has a repetitive sequence called polyglutamine.

There is a big problem with counterfeit and substandard medicines in poorer countries, particularly in Africa and Asia,  said Soumyajit Mandal, assistant professor in the Department Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in the Case School of Engineering.  In the U.S., the biggest problem is with various dietary supplements.  Mandal and his collaborators are developing a small, box-like detector that has been preliminary tested in field trials. ""The work builds on and improves a related project introduced in Europe a few years ago to create a portable, low-cost detector for medicines,"" he said. Mandal said the detector he and his colleagues are developing is much more flexible (capable of analyzing a wide variety of medicines and dietary supplements), and more sensitive (capable of measuring smaller quantities). Mandal is the principal investigator of the research and co-author of an associated paper to be published in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, a bimonthly peer-reviewed scientific journal. Research participants are Professor Swarup Bhunia at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, Fla., and Research Fellow Jamie Barras and Professor Kaspar Althoefer, both at King's College London.  Current results are very promising and have advantages over competing methods,  Mandal said.  The required instrumentation is simple and low-cost, compared to other analytical techniques, such as optical spectroscopy.  A global health concern The paper, titled  Authentication of Medicines using Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance Spectroscopy,  links their research to the concept of safe medicines  as a human right.  In 2013, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution focused on access to medicines  that are affordable, safe, effective and of good quality.   We think our technology will have an important positive impact on public health by enabling consumers to directly authenticate the contents packets or bottles without having to send samples to an analytical chemistry lab,  Mandal said. A medicine or dietary supplement might be incorrectly labeled for a variety of reasons intentional fraud, poor manufacturing practices and degradation due to poor storage or post-expiration date. The key to detection is to know the proper active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) in a medicine or supplement, so technicians can determine whether a pill or powder is what it appears to be. The technology being developed in Mandal s lab does not authenticate liquids. How it works The device uses Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) spectroscopy, a non-invasive and non-destructive analytical technique for medicines and supplements in pill or powder form. Most chemical elements have nuclei that generate NQR signals. Almost all medicines have API with NQR-active nuclei. Mandal s research team proposes a  chemometric passport approach  for quality assurance. Data on packaged medicines will be derived from a spectroscopic analysis performed at the point of manufacture. The contents of the packet will later be authenticated by matching the results of another spectroscopic analysis using unique chemical identifiers from a reference spectrum. Authentication information can be accessed either from a secure database stored in the cloud, or from information encoded directly within the product barcode. The absence of a match triggers a  contents don t match the label  alarm on the testing device. Mandal said that capability would be particularly useful at customs checkpoints and postal sorting offices when a barcode might not be visible. One day, he said, a person might be able to test his or her own medicines or supplements at home, which would have a direct effect on public health. The research is showing that NQR isn t sensitive to pill coatings and non-metallic packaging material, Mandal said.  Part of what we are proposing is to take this product and do a systematic survey of how much misidentification there is out there,  Mandal said.  We need more data to understand the extent of the problem. We are recruiting people willing to try our prototype. ","Published: February 10, 2016"

Scientists have had difficulty developing a method to engineer ""designer"" biosensor proteins that can precisely sense and report the presence of specific molecules, which has so far limited the number and variety of biosensor designs able to precisely regulate cell metabolism, cell biology, and synthetic gene circuits.  But new research published in Nature Methods by a team at Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and Harvard Medical School (HMS) has leveraged combination of computational protein design, in vitro synthesis and in vivo testing to establish a first-of-its-kind strategy for identifying custom-tailored biosensors. ""Our original motivation for developing customizable biosensors was to get a life or death feedback loop for metabolic engineering,"" said George Church, Ph.D., Wyss Institute Core Faculty member, Professor of Genetics at HMS, Professor of Health Sciences and Technology at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the senior author on the study. ""This would essentially give us 'Darwinian evolution on steroids', where colonies of bacteria genetically programmed to output a desirable commodity molecule would rapidly become more efficient from generation to generation as only the best metabolic producers will be 'self-identified' for survival."" ""This advance represents a powerful new way for us to access the chemical diversity of the biosphere by mining for new pathways to make useful molecules,"" said Srivatsan Raman, Ph.D., formerly a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Wyss Institute and HMS and currently Assistant Professor of Biochemistry at University of Wisconsin-Madison, who is the corresponding author on the study. To develop the method, researchers chose as their test case a natural regulatory protein from E. coli called LacI. LacI is an allosteric transcription factor (aTF), which becomes active in response to sensing ""inducer"" metabolites or molecules in the bacterium's environment, thereby triggering expression of a downstream gene. Using LacI, the team set out to develop a framework for re-engineering new biosensor variants that would respond to four inducer molecules (lactitol, sucralose, gentiobiose, and fucose) that cannot be metabolized by natural E. coli. Sucralose, for example, is a completely synthetic sugar molecule sold commercially as Splenda .Using LacI protein as a test case, Wyss Institute researchers developed custom protein variants that can sense arbitrary molecules. Here, a variant of LacI is depicted with mutated residues (flashing) that confer response to the small molecule sucralose (shown in green). Credit: Alexander Garruss/Wyss Institute at Harvard University To synthesize and identify the custom-made LacI variants for sensing these four new inducers, the team designed a novel workflow incorporating a combinatorial synthesis strategy that relies on computational protein design and the Wyss Institute's custom DNA synthesis resources to build a variant library of potential new biosensor designs comprising hundreds of thousands of mutated LacI proteins. Then, to identify the variants with the most specific responses to the four target molecules of interest, the team engineered groups of E. coli bacteria to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) when the desired molecule was detected, thereby making the bacteria fluoresce. Performing high-throughput in vivo screening of the sensor library in the engineered E. coli, the team identified the most effective variants by their high fluorescence, then filtered them out and genetically sequenced them to reveal the DNA profiles and design maps for transforming aTFs into custom-tailored sensors with high specificity. The results are striking in that an optimized engineered aTF sensor can be identified for sensing any arbitrary molecule using this approach, opening new doors in synthetic biology by putting allosteric proteins in the control of genetic engineers. ""The LacI protein we chose to re-design into a custom biosensor is only one of thousands of different allosteric transcription factors that exist in nature,"" said Noah Taylor, a graduate researcher at the Wyss Institute who recently finished his Ph.D. in Biological and Biomedical Sciences at HMS, and the first author on the study. ""The ability to engineer LacI using nothing more than sequence and structure information suggests we could find tens, hundreds, or even thousands of other biosensors that respond to different molecules."" Biosensors built using this approach provide feedback on how much of a certain metabolite is present inside a cell. Metabolically engineered bacteria can be outfitted with these custom aTFs, enabling them to monitor their own bioproduction of a desired chemical, pharmaceutical or biofuel. This allows sophisticated designs in which the lack of sufficient product could result in the death of an individual cell, eliminating it from the culture. In this way, powerful evolutionary methods can be harnessed for metabolic engineering. Sensitive detection of metabolites within cells also presents a new paradigm for the way scientists can interrogate single cells. Until now, it has been very challenging to study the metabolic state of a single individual cell. But designer biosensors could be utilized as custom responders to metabolites of interest, giving insight into the metabolic states of live cells in close to real time. ""We are now utilizing the method to find biosensors for a variety of high-value targets, particularly those that can aid in protecting the environment,"" said Alexander Garruss, co-author on the study, who is a graduate researcher at the Wyss Institute and a Ph.D. candidate in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics at HMS. Beyond measuring metabolites within cells, the combinatorial synthesis approach paves a path forward toward designing countless new and highly specific biological sensors for novel applications such as environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, bioremediation, and precision gene therapies.

The NANOPIX SAXS/WAXS measurement system can be used for both small angle scattering (SAXS) and wide angle scattering (WAXS) measurements, which makes it possible to evaluate multiscale structures from sub-nanometer to nano-order (0.1 nm to 100 nm). The NANOXPIX SAXS/WAXS measurement system achieves the highest level of small angle resolution (Qmin to 0.02 nm-1) for a laboratory SAXS instrument. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a technique used to study nanoscale structures of atoms or molecules and their variation by measuring the diffuse scattering from unequal electron density areas. SAXS experiments are performed in a wide range of fields from R&D to quality control. The NANOPIX SAXS/WAXS measurement system is applicable to the study of a variety of materials including solids, liquids, liquid-crystals, or gels with ordered and disordered structures, and diverse applications including nanoparticle size distribution analyses, three-dimensional protein molecule structure analyses, identification of molecular assembly or disassembly and research of advanced materials, such as carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP). The NANOPIX SAXS/WAXS measurement system is configured with a high-brilliance, high-power point focus X-ray source, the OptiSAXS high-performance multilayer mirror, the ClearPinhole high-performance, low scattering pinhole slits, and the HyPix-3000 high-performance 2D semiconductor detector that enables the detection of diffraction and scattering even from anisotropic materials. Optionally, the HyPix-6000 detector is also available for wide angle measurements, offering an expanded detection area by combining two detection modules. As one of the key features, the sample-to-detector distance is changeable depending on the structure size ranging from atomic structure (microstructures: 0.2 - 1 nm) to molecular structure (macrostructures: 1 - 100 nm). In addition, the NANOPIX SAXS/WAXS measurement system enables measurements under various temperature or humidity conditions, experiments with simultaneous DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) measurements, as well as measurements in combination with special attachments or other external devices. Control of the measurement environment is essential for the research of structure-property relationships of functional materials.","Published: February 10, 2016"

Prevalence increases with age, with 7.5 percent of children ages 15-17 and 6.0 percent of children ages 12-14 having any dizziness or balance problem, compared with 3.6 percent of children ages 6-8 and 4.1 percent of children ages 3-5. The research was led by investigators at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), part of the National Institutes of Health. Researchers found that girls have a higher prevalence of dizziness and balance problems compared to boys, 5.7 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively. In addition, non-Hispanic white children have an increased prevalence of dizziness and balance problems (6.1 percent) compared with Hispanic (4.6 percent) and non-Hispanic black (4.3 percent) children. ""These findings suggest that dizziness and balance problems are fairly common among children, and parents and providers should be aware of the impact these problems can have on our children,"" said James F. Battey, Jr., M.D., PhD, director of the NIDCD and a pediatrician. ""Parents who notice dizziness and balance problems in their children should consult a health care provider to rule out a serious underlying condition."" Previous estimates of dizziness and balance problems in children have ranged from 5 to 18 percent and have been based on limited, foreign, population-based studies. To better understand the prevalence of these problems among U.S. children, a team led by researchers from the epidemiology and statistics program at the NIDCD analyzed data from the Child Balance Supplement to the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The NHIS is an annual survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The survey uses personal household interviews to gather information about a range of health topics. The Child Balance Supplement was included in 2012 and was the first large-scale supplement added to the NHIS survey to assess dizziness and balance problems among children. The NIDCD provided funding for the 2012 Child Balance Supplement. The researchers analyzed data on nearly 11,000 children, ages 3 to 17, based on parents' responses to the survey. Parents were asked if in the past year, their children had been bothered by symptoms of dizziness or balance problems such as vertigo, poor balance/unsteadiness when standing up, clumsiness/poor coordination, frequent falls, fainting or light-headedness, or other dizziness and balance symptoms.","Published: February 10, 2016"

The team, from the MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health, estimated air pollution levels in the areas where the individuals lived in 1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001, using measurements from Britain's extensive historic air pollution monitoring networks. Highest risks were seen for respiratory disease, such as bronchitis, emphysema and for pneumonia. Air pollution also affected mortality risk from cardiovascular diseases, such as heart disease. Dr Anna Hansell, lead author of the study, from the MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health at Imperial, said: ""Air pollution has well established impacts on health, especially on heart and lung disease. The novel aspects of our study are the very long follow-up time and the very detailed assessment of air pollution exposure, using air quality measurements going back to the 1970s. ""Our study found more recent exposures were more important for mortality risk than historic exposures, but we need to do more work on how air pollution affects health over a person's entire lifetime. ""We were surprised to find pollution has effects on mortality that persist over three decades after exposure."" In the study, published in the journal Thorax, the researchers assessed levels of black smoke and sulphur dioxide air pollution from 1971 to 1991 and PM10 air pollution in 2001. Both black smoke and PM10 are measures of small particles in the air. Black smoke and sulphur dioxide were produced mainly by burning fossil fuels (including coal, oil, diesel, petrol). The methods of measuring air pollution have changed. A common measure is PM10, which measures very small particles that are less than 10 microns in size. These can travel deep into the lungs and may even be small enough to enter the bloodstream.  This type of air pollution is mainly produced by transport and industry with a contribution from construction activities and natural sources (e.g. sea salt, soil). In the study, risks from pollution exposures were reported in units of 10 micrograms per cubic metre of air. Researchers compared these levels of exposure with data on disease and deaths. The study suggests that for every additional unit of pollution that people were exposed to in 1971, the risk of mortality in 2002 to 2009 increases by two per cent. The researchers also looked at more recent exposure and found a 24 per cent increase in mortality risk in 2002 to 2009 for each additional unit of pollution people were exposed to in 2001. Dr Rebecca Ghosh, co-author of the study from the School of Public Health at Imperial, said ""Putting this in context, an individual who lived in a higher polluted area in 1971 had a 14 per cent higher risk of dying in 2002 to 2009 than someone who had lived in a lower polluted area.  An individual living in a higher polluted area in 2001 also had an increased risk of mortality of 14 per cent compared to someone in a low pollution area. Dr John Gulliver, co-author and Senior Lecturer at the MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health at Imperial, said: ""Levels of all types of air pollution in the UK have reduced dramatically since the start of our study period, with levels of black smoke currently estimated to be about 20 per cent of what they were in the 1970s."" Dr Anna Hansell added: ""It's important to remember that the effects of air pollution are small compared to other risk factors. Your risk of dying early is much more dependent on other aspects of your lifestyle, like whether you smoke, how much you exercise, whether you are overweight, as well as on medical factors like your blood pressure. This was true even with the higher air pollution levels in the 1970s.","Published: February 10, 2016"

The findings, by researchers from Imperial College London, may help explain why people who have suffered a serious brain injury appear to be at increased risk of dementia. Although extensive research now suggests major head injury increases dementia risk in later life, scientists do not know the biological changes that cause this effect.  The consequences of a head injury have been called a hidden disability - although patients may seem to have outwardly made a good recovery, when we see them in clinic years later they can have persistent problems which affect their daily life, for example impairments in concentration and memory,  said Dr Gregory Scott, the lead author of the paper, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial.  Research is increasingly showing that a blow to the head, such as that sustained in a road accident, triggers biological processes in the brain that burn away in the background for years,"" added Dr Scott.  Although previous research has shown that some head injury patients have these amyloid plaques shortly after the incident, these findings suggest these plaques are still present in the brains of patients over 10 years later. This helps shed light on why brain injury patients seem to be at increased risk of dementia   and may help us develop treatments that reduce this risk.  In the research, published in the journal Neurology, the team studied nine patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries. Many had sustained these in road traffic accidents, such as being hit by a car, between 11 months to 17 years prior to the study. Although they had no physical disabilities from the injury, many still suffered daily problems with memory and concentration. The patients, who were aged between 38-55, underwent a brain scan that used a technique that allows scientists to view amyloid plaques. These proteins are thought to be a hallmark of Alzheimer s disease, and their formation may trigger other changes that lead to the death of brain cells. The team also scanned the brains of healthy volunteers, and people with Alzheimer s disease. The patients with head injury were found to have more amyloid plaques than the healthy volunteers, but fewer than those with Alzheimer s disease. In the head injury patients, the amyloid plaques were found to be centered mainly in two brain areas:  the posterior cingulated cortex   a highly active area in the centre of the brain involved in controlling attention and memory, and the cerebellum - a region at the base of the brain involved in motor control and coordination. In a second part of the study, the team assessed damage to so-called white matter. This is the  wiring  of the brain, and enables brain cells to communicate with each other. The results showed that amyloid plaque levels in the posterior cingulated cortex were related to the amount of white matter damage, suggesting that injury to the brain s wiring may be linked to the formation of amyloid plaques. Although this is small-scale study, explained Dr Scott, it provides hope for developing treatments in the future that may help treat the long-term effects of head injuries. ""This is a preliminary study, and it s important to stress that these head injury patients didn t have Alzheimer s disease. However it supports the idea that the window of treatment for brain injury is potentially months or even years after the initial event. If we can find out exactly what processes are going on in the brain, it may be that we can intervene and improve long-term outcomes for patients. ""The works also highlights how damaging brain injury can be   and fuels the public health debate about what we can do to protect ourselves against head injuries.""","Published: February 10, 2016"

Transgene, ABL, Inc. and ABL Europe are all three members of the Institut M rieux. The production asset is designed and equipped to manufacture clinical lots of biopharmaceuticals and vaccines using viral vectors. ABL Europe has just received authorization by the French Agence Nationale de S curit  du M dicament to operate a Pharmaceutical Establishment, a mandatory step to begin operations at the site. Manufacturing and other services will be provided under E.U. and U.S. GMP. An addition to ABL s bioproduction capabilities. This acquisition provides ABL with a European bioproduction facility up to the most stringent quality standards, which will allow it to serve the European CMO market, in addition to its already well established position in that field in the U.S. With its Rockville (MD) production unit and its new site in Illkirch, France, ABL will be a premier global CMO in the field, with the ability to significantly increase internationally client responsiveness and schedule flexibility. Finalization of Transgene s industrial strategy The sale by Transgene of its production asset was the last step of the company s reorganization initiated in June 2015. Indeed, part of the reorganization plan was the outsourcing of the manufacturing of clinical lots and focusing on the company s core expertise, the immuno-engineering of viral vectors and clinical developments. Secured Production In parallel to this transaction, Transgene and ABL Europe have signed a three-year agreement under which Transgene has secured the production of the necessary clinical lots for its clinical development plan. Thomas VanCott, Ph.D., President and CEO of ABL, Inc. commented:  We have seen a consistent increase in demand for the production of virus-based products in recent years. Innovators from industry and the public sector require partners that can provide diverse and high level skill sets for the development of vaccines against emerging diseases, to gene and immunotherapies. Production in compliance with pharmaceutical-grade quality is essential to advance these products from the laboratory to scalable, GMP-compliant production for clinical and commercial supply.  Philippe Archinard, Chairman and CEO of Transgene declared:  We are delighted about crossing this final major step of our reorganization plan and the implementation of our new industrial strategy. We are selling a quality asset to a player we fully trust. Securing the procurement of our clinical lots for the next three years was a key element of the deployment of our clinical development plan. This new strategy for the production of our clinical lots and, later, commercial lots, leans now on two important 2 actors: ABL Europe and Sanofi/Genzyme with whom we have signed an agreement in 2013.

Our research shows that growing up poor promotes eating in the absence of hunger in adulthood, regardless of one s wealth in adulthood,  explains psychological scientist Sarah Hill of Texas Christian University.  These findings are important because they suggest that a person s developmental history may play a key role in their relationship with food and weight management.  See Also: Mouse study advances our understanding of eating disorders Previous research has established childhood poverty as a risk factor for obesity, but the mechanisms driving this relationship are not completely clear. While a lack of access to healthy foods and safe places to play may help to explain the association, Hill and colleagues wondered whether early experiences might become biologically embedded in ways that shape how individuals regulate energy needs throughout the lifespan. This biological blueprint would help children survive in impoverished environments, leading them to seek out food whenever it is available, and would continue to drive their behavior as they aged, regardless of whether their access to food had improved. In one study, Hill and colleagues recruited 31 undergraduate women to participate in what was purportedly a consumer research study. To rule out the potential effects of obesity and specific medical conditions, only women who had a body mass index of less than 30 and those who did not have food allergies or diabetes were eligible to participate. The students received a bowl of chocolate chip cookies and a bowl of pretzels and were told to sample and rate each product. After completing their ratings, they were told that they were free to eat the leftovers while they waited for the next part of the study to begin. They then completed a survey in which they were asked to think about their childhood before age 12 and rate their level of agreement with three statements:  My family had enough money for things growing up,   I grew up in a relatively wealthy neighborhood,   I felt relatively wealthy compared to others my age.  After they finished, the researchers calculated how much the participants had eaten based on the food that remained in the two bowls. Looking at the data for students who reported feeling relatively hungry, the researchers found no observable difference in calories consumed between those who grew up in more impoverished environments and those who grew in relatively abundant environments. But childhood environment did seem to make a difference in how much people ate when they weren t actually hungry: Students from relatively impoverished environments ate more of the pretzels and cookies, and more calories overall, than did those who came from wealthier backgrounds. Hill and colleagues found that energy need didn t seem to play a role in determining how much participants from impoverished backgrounds ate. In another experiment, the researchers varied energy need by providing some participants who had fasted with a full-calorie soda and others with zero-calorie sparkling water. Thus, some participants received a calorie boost to fill their energy need, while others did not. Again, the researchers found that childhood environment made a difference in how much participants consumed, but only when their energy need was low. Learn More: Research links impulsivity and binge eating These findings were replicated in a third study that directly measured blood glucose levels in both male and female participants.  We were surprised by the lasting impact that one s childhood environment plays in guiding food intake in adulthood,  says Hill.  We were also surprised by the fact that one s level of wealth in adulthood had almost no impact on patterns of food intake.  The researchers caution that these findings do not establish a direct causal relationship between childhood poverty and eating in the absence of energy need. However, they do suggest that early environmental experiences may influence how individuals regulate their energy needs.  Our research suggests that people who grew up in relatively impoverished environments may have a harder time controlling food intake and managing their body weight than those who grew up in wealthier environments,  explains Hill.

Ticks spread more different kinds of infectious microbes to people and animals than any other arthropod group,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  The spiral-shaped bacterium that causes Lyme disease is perhaps the best known microbe transmitted by ticks; however, ticks also transmit infectious agents that cause human babesiosis, anaplasmosis, tick-borne encephalitis and other diseases. The newly assembled genome provides insight into what makes ticks such effective disease vectors and may generate new ways to lessen their impact on human and animal health.  Catherine A. Hill, Ph.D., of Purdue University, headed the team of investigators. Aside from the logistical challenges of coordinating activities of dozens of workers across many time zones, the researchers  focus was a creature that is extremely difficult to maintain and that lives a long time   up to two years in the wild and nine months in the lab, Dr. Hill noted. Ixodes ticks have three blood-feeding life stages, and during each one, they feed on a different vertebrate animal. During feeding, ticks ingest blood for hours or days at a time. After mating, adult female ticks rapidly imbibe a large blood meal during which they expand hugely.  Because genes may switch on or off depending on the life stage of the tick, we needed to culture and collect ticks at each stage for analysis. This was not easy to do,  said Dr. Hill. Another challenge was the sheer size of the tick genome   some 2.1 billion DNA base pairs   and expansive regions where sequences are repeated.  The degree of DNA repetition   approximately 70 percent of the total   made assembling the full genome in the correct order very difficult,  Dr. Hill said. In the end, the team determined the order and sequence of about two-thirds of the total genome.  We determined the sequence for 20,486 protein-coding genes,  she said,  of which 20 percent may be unique to ticks. Those tick-specific genes are like guideposts that say  start here  as we look for new ways to counter infectious ticks.  Although the latest research represents just a first look at the tick genome, the scientists have already identified genes and protein families that shed light on why Ixodes ticks succeed so well as parasites and hint at the reasons they excel at spreading pathogens, Dr. Hill noted. For example, compared with other blood-feeders, ticks have many more proteins devoted to consuming, concentrating and detoxifying their iron-containing food. Although mosquitoes   which quickly siphon up relatively small amounts of blood through a tube-like mouthpiece   have several proteins dedicated to blood digestion, ticks have many more proteins involved in this process. Other genes code for proteins that help ticks concentrate the blood and rapidly excrete excess water that accompanies large blood meals. Still other genes allow ticks to quickly expand their stiff outer coats to accommodate a 100-fold increase in total body size during blood feeding. Other peculiarities of the tick s lifestyle reflected in the genome include genes associated with the multifaceted sensory systems that the parasite uses when  questing  for a host during each of its separate blood-feeding stages. Compared with mosquitoes, ticks appear to have fewer genes used to detect hosts, and, unlike a mosquito s  smell  receptors, ticks may use  taste  receptors to locate their food sources. Each of the newly identified proteins is a potential target for new, tick-specific interventions, explained Dr. Hill.  The genome gives us a code book to the inner workings of ticks. With it, we can now begin to hack their system and write a counter-script against them.  In an effort to explain variations in Lyme disease prevalence across the United States, the team also examined genetic diversity within and among I. scapularis populations gathered from five states in the Northeast and Midwest and three in the South. Some have speculated that ticks in the Northeast and Midwest spread the bacteria that cause Lyme disease more easily than those in the South, or that the two populations perhaps comprise separate species. The genetic analysis showed that there is only one species of I. scapularis, said Dr. Hill, but subtle genetic differences were detected, and these may help explain some of the variance in the ability of populations to transmit disease and, therefore, affect disease prevalence. Dr. Hill admits to a grudging admiration for her eight-legged subjects.  I find them almost endearing in the way they stick so firmly to the business of parasitizing their hosts. They are persistent and resilient. In a way, our team took a page from the tick s book in working together over so many years until we achieved our goal. ","Published: February 9, 2016"

Professor Fredrik B ckhed and his research colleagues have shown in several high-profile studies that metabolism related diseases such as diabetes, obesity and coronary heart disease are associated with bacterial changes in our guts. Wild brown bears In what Fredrik B ckhed describes as  classic basic research , he and his colleagues have mapped the seasonal variation in the gut microbiota, in sixteen wild brown bears. The idea for the study comes from insights in dietary habits of brown bears that changes from an extreme energy intake during the summer to complete cessation during the winter, when the bear hibernates. Studies have shown that the brown bear is insulin sensitive during the summer, while it develops insulin resistance during the winter months, in order to reduce energy consumption in the body and save energy for the brain. Seasonal changes In the present study, which involved researchers from the Scandinavian Brown Bear Research Project,  rebro University and Duke University, it was shown that the brown bear s gut microbiota significantly changed per season.  During winter hibernation, the concentration of several specific molecules in the bear s blood increase, a process that we believe reflects changes in the gut microbiota. When summer is well underway, the omnivorous bear eats varied diet, which increase microbial diversity , says Fredrik B ckhed. Mice with bear microbiota In an experiment where the bears  gut microbiota was transferred to germ-free mice, the researchers were able to observe that mice receiving the bears  summer gut microbiota increased their capacity to store fat.  Especially interesting was the notion that the mice became fatter without developing insulin resistance, similar to the bears from where the microbiota was obtained,  says B ckhed,  The study is classic basic research and more studies are needed to arrive at any practical applications. But the bear study provides new knowledge on how gut microbiota affects our metabolism, a finding that may help us to develop bacteria based treatments in the future. ","Published: February 9, 2016"

Originally formed by GSK, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), the CTTV fosters deep, ongoing interactions between academic and industry members for the purpose of developing open, transformative approaches to selecting and validating novel targets in drug development. The CTTV uses advances in genetic research and computational biology to help scientists with the crucial first step in exploring new medicines: finding where to start. Target validation, an exercise that clearly defines the role that a biological process plays in a disease, is a key initial phase of drug discovery. Currently, an estimated 90 percent of compounds entering clinical trials fail to demonstrate the necessary efficacy and safety requirements, never reaching patients as medicines. This is often because the biological target chosen is not well understood.  We are committed to advancing evidence-based target discovery and opening up the field for researchers to create innovative methods and tools to accelerate the development of new medicines,  says Sally John, vice president, Computational Biology & Genomics at Biogen.  Being part of the CTTV helps us realize this vision and provides a practical, harmonized way to share data with the scientific community.  Biogen s new membership follows the launch of the new CTTV Target Validation Platform (www.targetvalidation.org), which helps researchers identify therapeutic targets for new medicines. Underscoring its utility for drug discovery, the platform has had over 9000 visits since its launch in December 2015. Philip Ma, vice president, Digital Health Technology & Data Sciences at Biogen, adds:  The importance of accessing and managing searchable, structured data is critical to sharing knowledge on target validation. We look forward to combining our expertise in data sciences with the leading capabilities of GSK, the Sanger Institute and EMBL-EBI.   The CTTV is proud to announce the addition of Biogen to our collaboration to improve the process of identifying and validating targets,  elaborates Jeffrey Barrett, CTTV Director.  The pre-competitive nature of CTTV is critical: the collaboration of our members allows us to make the most of commercial R&D practice while making the data and information available to everyone. It is truly exciting to apply so many different areas of expertise, from cell biology to large scale genome analysis, to the challenge of creating better medicines.  The CTTV covers all aspects of human health and disease.

People with HPV-positive tumors of the throat, base of the tongue and tonsils have higher overall survival rates compared to people with similar tumors not caused by HPV, but studies show that more than 25 percent of HPV-positive cancers recur usually within the first two years after treatment.  There are currently no reliable tests available to detect early recurrence, so we hope to find a biological marker that could help identify those most at risk,  says Carole Fakhry, M.D., M.P.H., associate professor of otolaryngology head and neck surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and member of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. For the new study, Fakhry and her colleagues focused their attention on the antibodies, or immune system protein the body produces to fight HPV-related cancer proteins. One such antibody, called E6, is strongly linked to the diagnosis of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. Levels of the E6 antibody should fall when a patient is treated and cured of their cancer, Fakhry and her colleagues reasoned, so an increase in a patient s E6 levels after treatment might indicate a higher risk of the cancer returning. To find out, the researchers looked back at the health records and blood serum samples of 60 patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer and a median age of 56, mostly Caucasian men, who were treated at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Some 43 of the patients had samples taken before their treatment, 34 had samples taken up to six months after therapy, and 52 had samples taken six months or later after therapy. Among the 60 patients, Fakhry and colleagues identified six cases of recurring cancer within an average of 4.4 years of follow-up after treatment. The scientists looked at a variety of HPV cancer cell antibodies in these patients and discovered that the average level of most of these antibodies was lower after treatment. Patients who had high levels of E6 antibody before their treatment were seven times more likely than those with lower levels to have their cancer return, they also found. Fakhry says the study is a promising start toward finding a way to identify patients most at risk for a cancer recurrence through the use of a blood test, but much more data are needed to confirm E6 s usefulness as a biomarker. One of the best ways to proceed, she says, would be to conduct a study of the antibody on a large group of patients at the start of their treatment, drawing blood at a series of predetermined points during their therapy to examine E6 levels. At the moment, these HPV antibodies are not measured routinely in patients, so it is difficult to estimate the costs and time needed to conduct such a  gold-standard  trial, she notes. More research is also needed to know whether such tests would be useful in determining the path of a patient s follow-up care, such as whether and how often a patient might need imaging or clinical exams to watch for a cancer s possible return.  Potentially, a low-risk patient may need less stringent surveillance while a high-risk patient may require more intense imaging,  Fakhry explains.  But this is far away from clinical practice, as we would really need to understand whether this hypothetical approach [with E6] would improve lead time to diagnosis of recurrence and survival outcomes.

Yudell and his co-authors point to evidence from phylogenetics and population genetics  that racial classifications do not makes sense in terms of genetics.  When applying simple biological methods, the co-authors contend that commonly defined racial groups  lack clear-cut genetic boundaries.  One clear problem with using race as a distinguishing factor in modern biology and medicine is that  racial assumptions are not the biological guideposts some believe them to be,  the co-authors said. Furthermore, they point to how the continued use of race in genetic studies has fueled racist beliefs, so much so that leading biologists were forced, in 2014, to refute claims about  the genetic basis of social differences between races.  It s also important to not confuse ancestry with the concept of race, the co-authors point out.  Ancestry is a statement about an individual s relationship to other individuals in their genealogical history; thus, it is a very personal understanding of one's genomic heritage,  they said.  Race, on the other hand, is a pattern-based concept that has led scientists and laypersons alike to draw conclusions about hierarchical organization of humans.  As such, the team of experts believes that race should be phased out from genetic research and more deliberate language like  ancestry or population  used to describe the grouping for studies. Those terms should also be  clearly define[d].   Language matters, and the scientific language of race has a significant influence on how the public (which includes scientists) understands human diversity,  the co-authors wrote.  Having journals rationalize the use of classificatory terminology in studying human genetic diversity would force scientists to clarify their use and allow researchers to understand and interpret data across studies.  Such an effort would allow for less confusion across studies and also  send out an important message to scientists and the public alike: historical racial categories that are treated as natural and infused with notions of superiority and inferiority have no place in biology.  That s not to say that race as a construct has no value at all when it comes to scientific study. Yudell and his co-authors agree that, although it contains it s own set of issues, race can be used as a social and political category to better understand inequities and the health disparities therein. But using race as a category in genomics should be a thing of the past, and Yudell, Roberts, Tishkoff, and DeSalle urge the United State National Academies of Sciences to convene a panel of experts to figure out new tools for looking into human diversity without utilizing the race concept.  We believe that genetics continues to operate in a paradox: The belief that race is a tool to elucidate human genetic diversity and believing that race is a poorly defined marker of that diversity and an imprecise proxy for the relation between ancestry and genetics,  Yudell said.  It is time that scientists find a way to resolve this to improve the study of human diversity. ","Published: February 9, 2016"

The drug we made appears safe, and boosts immunity in mice. Therefore, the drug, which is straightforward to synthesize and to couple to antigens that induce an immune response, may prove useful in the generation of vaccines,  said Dr. Bruce Beutler, Director of UT Southwestern s Center for the Genetics of Host Defense. The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, builds on work that earned Dr. Beutler a share of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his use of classic genetics approaches to identify the mammalian LPS (lipopolysaccharide) receptor TLR4, which engages LPS particles on Gram-negative bacteria and initiates an immune response. In so doing, Dr. Beutler demonstrated that the mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLRs) sense microbial infections and launch the body s immune response.  This is the first drug that is designed to activate the TLR4/MD-2 complex, whichnormally senses bacterial LPS. The results show that the drug elicits the same shape change in TLR4/MD-2 as LPS does, but achieves this change by binding to different contact points on the surface of the protein,  Dr. Beutler said. The researchers screened about 90,000 compounds for their ability to activate production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF ), a cell signaling protein involved in inflammation. Two compounds with immune-cell stimulating activity were identified, the strongest of which was named Neoseptin-1. Through chemical modifications, the researchers created the more potent Neoseptin. Dr. Beutler noted that the study was a multidisciplinary collaboration between his genetics laboratory; the structural biology laboratory of Dr. Hong Zhang, Associate Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics at UT Southwestern; and chemistry and genetics laboratories at The Scripps Research Institute, where Dr. Beutler worked prior to returning to UT Southwestern.  By studying how the drug becomes attached to the TLR4 receptor using X-ray crystallography, we were able to determine that unlike any other drug target interactions studied, this one involves two drug molecules binding to each other noncovalently (without a chemical bond between the two molecules  electrons) at the active site of the target protein,  he said. In mouse cell studies, Neoseptin-3 touched off an immune response similar to that caused by LPS. But it did so by having contact with different amino acids in the TLR4 and MD-2 proteins. In addition to being a chemically very different molecule from LPS, Neoseptin-3 also generated a milder immune response, he said. In contrast, LPS induces a strong response that can be toxic.","Published: February 9, 2016"

Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, helps keep our bodies healthy by ensuring that excess or potentially dangerous cells self-destruct. One way cells know when to pull the plug is through signals received by so-called death receptors that stud cells  surfaces. Researchers studying a death receptor called Fas have now found that for immune cells to hear the death knell, a largely overlooked portion of the receptor must coil into an intricate three-part formation. The findings revise scientists  understanding of how these receptors work and provide new ways to consider tackling diseases that can develop when apoptotic signals go awry, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. Slippery problem Transmembrane receptors like Fas have three parts: a region that protrudes outside the cell and receives signals, a region embedded in the cell membrane and a region that relays the signal for the cell to act upon. Until recently, scientists thought the middle portion was simply an anchor.  We weren t convinced the transmembrane region did anything,  said James J. Chou, professor of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology and co-senior author of the study. But hints had been emerging from Chou s lab and from others that there was more to the story. For example, researchers discovered mutations in Fas s transmembrane region that cause cancer.  This suggested the region played a role in apoptotic signaling and made us want to look more closely,  said co-senior author Hao Wu, the Asa and Patricia Springer Professor of Structural Biology and professor of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology at HMS and senior investigator at Boston Children s. Wu has for years been studying the family of receptors Fas belongs to, called tumor necrosis factor or TNF receptors. She wanted to know the atomic structure of Fas s transmembrane region because it would tell her something about the region s function. So she approached Chou, a specialist in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Chou s lab had to devise a technique to better mimic a real cell membrane s oily bilayer and coax the transmembrane proteins to assemble in a test tube. But in the end, the team got its atomic structure. Unexpected twist Wu and Chou had been scratching their heads over what they d found when they analyzed the DNA of the transmembrane region: The sequences suggested that the transmembrane proteins had helix shapes and that they also contained the amino acid proline, which  is supposed to be a helix breaker,  said Wu. How could they both be true? NMR allowed them to resolve the conundrum. The 3-D structure confirmed that the transmembrane region consisted of three identical protein helices wound together and revealed that proline introduced a  tiny kink  that allowed the helices to pack more tightly.  It s critical for stable assembly of the trimer,  said Chou. To the authors  knowledge, no one had seen proline do that before in transmembrane receptors. Collaborating with TNF specialist Richard Siegel, clinical director and senior investigator at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, the team found that the snapshot they captured represents the Fas transmembrane region s structure after it has been activated. They learned that when the extracellular region receives a  time to die  signal, it triggers the transmembrane region to coil into formation. Only then can the signal pass into the cell.  We didn t know how the three parts of the receptor cooperate to produce the signal,  said Wu.  This study provides the missing link to show how they all work together.   The textbooks need to be revised,  said Chou.  The transmembrane region is crucial in connecting extracellular signal binding and the chemical modifications that occur inside the cell.  Further work showed that the cancer-causing mutations researchers had spotted in the Fas transmembrane region deformed its delicate structure and prevented signals from passing through. One of the mutations struck proline itself.  The effects of some of the mutations are so subtle, it s unbelievable,  said Chou.  We wouldn t have seen them without obtaining the high-resolution structure.  A larger story This new understanding of how Fas receptors work at the molecular level could ultimately improve scientists  ability to treat certain conditions related to faulty apoptosis signaling. If a patient has a transmembrane mutation in Fas that prevents their immune cells from self-destructing and allows tumors to grow,  You could conceivably go through other death receptors  to deliver the message, suggested Chou. Alternately, if cells are self-destructing too readily, researchers might consider  inhibiting the receptor directly in this region  to reduce the death signal, said Wu. The study could have even wider impact.  Fas is really just a model system,  said Chou.  What excites me is that the discovery is likely to be applicable to the other members of the TNF receptor family,  such as DR5, currently being pursued as a drug target for killing pancreatic and colon cancers, and TNFR1, which may improve autoimmune diseases when suppressed. Already, Wu and Chou are exploring whether the transmembrane portions of other TNF receptors share Fas s three-pronged, proline-kinked structure.  Understanding the mechanistic basis of how these receptors signal means we can screen for drugs and antibodies in a more informed way and can do other creative things to kill cancer cells and not healthy cells,  said Chou.","Published: February 9, 2016"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/cytoskeleton-crew-191840,Cytoskeleton Crew Findings confirm sugar s role in helping cancers survive by changing cellular architecture  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) is a cell-signaling molecule that has now been implicated in a large number of women s cancers including breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers. New research led by a scientific team at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center provides important insights into the biology underlying PI3K s role in glycolysis, the metabolic process that enables cancer cells to thrive by generating biomass and energy. The new findings confirm the importance of sugar to cancer survival and provide essential new information for the development of PI3K-inhibitor drugs as targeted cancer therapies.  This study demonstrates that PI3K is a master regulator, integrating a cancer cell s architecture and its metabolism,  said corresponding author Gerburg Wulf, associate professor of medicine at HMS and an oncologist in the Cancer Center at Beth Israel Deaconess. How are sugar breakdown and cellular architecture coordinated? The answer, said Wulf, turns out to be a surprisingly simple biophysical mechanism.  In a normal cell, signaling from outside activates the cytoskeleton, the highly organized and flexible framework of the cell,  explained Wulf.  The cytoskeleton is not static; it s a dynamic assembly of fiber bundles that undergo constant turnover, breaking down the energy molecule ATP in order to maintain the cell s shape.  These fibers are composed of the protein actin, and Wulf s team discovered that when PI3K is activated and ATP breakdown is accelerated as occurs in cancer cells the actin fibers fall apart and release an enzyme called aldolase.  It turns out that enzymes sit on these actin fibers, like birds might sit on a telephone wire,  she adds.  If the wire is cut, the birds fly away. Similarly, when actin fibers are broken down, the aldolase enzymes fall off. We discovered that it s the process of  falling off  that activates aldolase and accelerates glycolysis.  How PI3K inhibition curbs sugar metabolism PI3K was first discovered 20 years ago by Lewis Cantley, director of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medical College and the study s co-senior author. When it functions normally, the PI3K pathway regulates key cell functions including growth, motility, proliferation and differentiation. But an overactive PI3K signaling pathway can contribute to the development of breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers. Based on these observations, the development of PI3K inhibitors has been a major focus of personalized cancer therapies.  Inhibiting PI3K leads to a profound inhibition of glucose breakdown,  explained Wulf.  This is particularly important for cancer cells because they rely heavily on the metabolism of sugar for their self-renewal, generating not only energy but also biomass, the building blocks with which DNA and proteins are made.  A cascade of enzymes catalyzes glycolysis, but a focused approach using mass spectrometry, conducted by co-author John Asara, HMS assistant professor of medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess, pinpointed the enzyme aldolase as the critical target of PI3K-mediated regulation.  Aldolase is distinct from other enzymes involved in glycolysis in that it catalyzes the breakdown of the 6-carbon backbone of sugar into two 3-carbon molecules,  said Wulf.  These 3-carbon building blocks can then be the starting points to generate new biomass that ultimately enables cell division and the expansion of the tumor mass.  This new discovery creates a previously unidentified link between a cancer cell s form and shape and its metabolic capabilities, say the authors, explaining that this method doesn t involve any nuclear transcription or translation, rather it is redistribution of the aldolase from the cytoskeleton into the cytoplasm that paces glycolysis.  This is a very important discovery in that it indicates that the highly motile actin long known as a hallmark of cancer cells and the property that makes them look transformed to the human eye is, in fact, playing a major role in regulating cancer metabolism,  said Cantley.  As a physician-scientist, I develop research questions based on the clinical needs of my patients,  said Wulf.  The need for new therapies to treat women s cancers, in particular metastatic breast cancer as well as ovarian and uterine cancers, is great. As we continue our investigations of PI3K, it s becoming clear that blocking this pathway alone is not enough to stop cancer growth and that PI3K inhibitors may be drugs that need to be combined with other drugs to effectively and specifically block tumor-cell metabolism. These new findings provide us with essential information as we work to identify the companion therapies that will prove to be good partners for PI3K inhibitors. ","Published: February 9, 2016"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/the-spice-of-life-211966,The Spice of Life Scientists discover important genetic source of human diversity  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute report that humans have a surprisingly high number of genes in which one of two copies has been randomly silenced. They suggest that the phenomenon is an important source of genetic diversity among people and also may help explain the genetic variation among cancer cells in a tumor. A team led by Alex Gimelbrant, HMS assistant professor of genetics at Dana-Farber found that genes with monoallelic expression, or MAE, contribute disproportionately to human genetic diversity. The human genome includes between 20,000 and 25,000 genes that encode the recipes for making proteins. Each gene in a cell exists in two copies, or alleles, one inherited from the father and one from the mother. The copies may be identical or different, but in most cases both alleles are expressed actively issuing instructions for making a protein. When only one of a pair of alleles is active, that gene is said to have monoallelic expression. A few examples of such genes have been known for several decades, but Gimelbrant and other scientists have more recently developed powerful tools for searching for them in the genome. Studies have estimated that MAE can occur in an estimated 10 to 25 percent of genes in many types of cells. For example, such genes are found in cells of the immune system and the olfactory system, where genetic diversity helps otherwise identical cells respond to many different combinations of stimuli. In such genes where only one allele is expressed, it s not because the other copy has been damaged or lost. Instead, said Gimelbrant, in a gene with monoallelic expression, there s an equal chance for either of the two copies to be expressed during early development but only one of the copies will be expressed. This random decision doesn t change the DNA in that cell, but the decision to express only one allele is  inherited  by the offspring of that cell, through what is called an epigenetic process. In other words, the identical genes in the daughter cells will also be monoallelic. In the new research, the investigators studied 4,227 genes with monoallelic expression to assess the extent of genetic variation of these genes and their contribution to human diversity. They said they were surprised to discover that these genes have unusually high genetic variation. As a result, the MAE genes  substantially increase the potential for cell-to-cell variability within an individual,  the authors wrote.  It looks like this is a very widespread mechanism that is responsible for genetic variation.  Not only widespread, but ancient: They traced this mechanism back to the Neanderthals and said it exists in chimpanzees. From an evolutionary standpoint, individuals whose cells have genetic variability may more successfully adapt to their environment. A well-known example is that of genes causing sickle cell anemia. Individuals who carry identical genes for the disease have a shorter life expectancy than those whose cells have two normal genes. But in parts of Africa where malaria is epidemic, people who are heterozygous one sickle cell allele and one normal allele are more resistant to developing malaria. Cancer tumors are made up of cells that grow and evolve much as populations do, and they are often found to be genetically heterogeneous. That is, the tumors include cells of several distinct genetic types, some of which may be vulnerable to a cancer drug while others are not. As a result, physicians need to try different drugs or combinations to prevent the tumor from escaping treatment.  We think this variation may be a result of monoallelic expression of cells in the tumor,  said Gimelbrant. MAE may also account for a situation in which two siblings, for example, may carry the same gene that raises the risk of cancer or some other disease, and yet one of them develops the condition while the other remains healthy.","Published: February 9, 2016"

It is a natural browning process common among certain organisms, including food. This same enzyme also plays a role in the type of skin cancer known as melanoma. This cancer s tell-tale spots are the result of a malfunction in the regulation of tyrosinase. The malfunction disrupts the pigmentation of the skin by melanin, the body s natural protection against the sun. Chemist Tzu-En Lin took advantage of the fact that tyrosinase occurs in both ripe fruit and human melanoma to develop an imaging technique capable of measuring tyrosinase levels and its distribution in human skin. Research was first conducted on ripe fruit and then on samples of cancerous tissue. It was shown that the level and distribution of tyrosinase was indicative of the stage of the disease. It is not very apparent in stage 1; in stage 2 it is present in large amounts and evenly distributed; and in stage 3 it is unevenly distributed. The team, which is directed by Hubert Girault at the Laboratory of Physical and Analytical Electrochemistry at Sion (EPFL Valais Wallis), determined that this enzyme is a reliable marker of melanoma growth.  The spots on human skin and on a banana peel are roughly the same size. By working with fruit, we were able to develop and test a diagnostic method before trying it on human biopsies,  said Dr. Girault. The researchers made a scanner with eight microelectrodes lined up like the teeth of a comb and as flexible as the fingers of a hand. These tiny sensors pass over the uneven surface of the skin without damaging it and measure the electrochemical response within an area of a few square millimeters. The electrodes calculate the quantity and distribution of tyrosinase, which allows the researchers to determine the stage of the melanoma. This system could obviate the need for invasive tests like biopsies. The next step will be to use this same scanner to view the tumors and eliminate them.  Our initial laboratory tests showed us that our device could be used to destroy the cells,  said Dr. Girault.","Published: February 9, 2016"

A synopsis of the study and its conclusions are outlined in a poster entitled  Novel rat models to study primary genital herpes simplex virus-2 infection.  Sheryl Wildt, Envigo s Global Manager of Genetic Quality and Breeding, commented,  There is an urgent need for a vaccine against herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2), not only because HSV-2 is a common sexually transmitted virus, but also because HSV-2 infection facilitates transmission of HIV. Limitations to HSV-2 genital mouse models and guinea pig models led us to investigate whether our Envigo rat stocks or strains were susceptible to HSV-2 infection and, if so, to determine if attenuated HSV-1 could serve as a protection against symptomatic HSV-2 infections in susceptible animals. To our knowledge, there are no previous studies describing rats as a genital model of HSV-2 infection.  The Envigo study demonstrated that several Envigo rat models are susceptible to genital HSV-2 infection, with the outcome varying between different stocks or strains. The F344/NHsd strain proved to be the most susceptible and may be suitable as an alternative or complementary animal model for efficacy studies for prophylactic vaccine candidates. The Hsd:Sprague Dawley  SD  stock, being the least susceptible, can be used to study protective immune mechanisms involved in the primary asymptomatic HSV-2 infection. This model also has the potential to recapitulate the human genital HSV-2 infection. Furthermore, Envigo also investigated if prior HSV-1 infection is protective against HSV-2 infection. All HSV-2 infected rats previously infected with attenuated HSV-1 survived and developed no genital or systemic symptoms. Consequently, the described Envigo rat models provide a new approach to investigate the protective effects of anti-viral microbicides and vaccine candidates as well as to study asymptomatic primary genital HSV-2 infection.","Published: February 9, 2016"

Focusing on specific regions of tumors in patients with lung cancer   the leading cause of cancer death worldwide   Dr. Ralph DeBerardinis and his team at CRI analyzed the process by which different areas of tumors regulate the sources of energy needed for growth, and the manner in which the surrounding cellular environment influences that metabolic activity. The findings, published in Cell, may pave the way for exploiting cancer metabolism to predict disease progression and treat cancer.  One of the compelling ideas cancer biologists have pursued for many years is that it might be possible to treat all cancers in a similar way by cutting off the fuel supply to the tumor cells   essentially starving them to death,  said Dr. DeBerardinis, Associate Professor of CRI and Pediatrics, Director of CRI s Genetic and Metabolic Disease Program, and Chief of the Division of Pediatric Genetics and Metabolism at UT Southwestern. Dr. De Berardinis  Continued  But we were surprised in our study to find how much metabolic variety there was among the tumors   in some cases detecting different metabolic activities even within different areas of the same tumor   which makes it unlikely that a  starvation bullet  to treat cancers can be developed.  The study also provides insight into a long-standing misconception about cancer metabolism. For nearly a century, researchers had relied upon the idea that a metabolic switch takes place when a benign tumor becomes cancerous, whereby oxidative metabolism is turned off and glycolytic metabolism is turned on. The CRI study found that there is no switch from one source of energy to the other; instead, both types of metabolism increase when a benign tissue becomes cancerous. The study also suggests that glucose is not the sole nutrient that solid tumors consume for energy, but is one of many nutrients, a finding that potentially expands the number of metabolic pathways that could be targeted to fight a tumor s progression. In addition, it appears that the metabolic preference of tumors that is determined by their genetics can be overridden by the cellular environment. Tumors   and even different regions of the same tumor   that receive a lot of blood flow were found to use many different nutrients for energy. Tumors and different areas of the same tumor that receive less blood flow were more likely to use glucose as the primary fuel.  Now that we have a much better handle on how metabolism operates in lung tumors, and where particular metabolic activities are located within a tumor, it should be easier to study exactly which activities predict and stimulate disease progression,  said Dr. DeBerardinis, who at UT Southwestern is also affiliated with the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth & Development, holds the Joel B. Steinberg, M.D. Chair in Pediatrics, and is a Sowell Family Scholar in Medical Research.","Published: February 9, 2016"

They also found evidence that this methylation signature may be present in many more types of cancer. The specific signature results from a chemical modification of DNA called methylation, which can control the expression of genes like a dimmer on a light switch. Higher amounts of DNA methylation (hypermethylation), like that found by the researchers in some tumor DNA, decreases a gene's activity. Based on this advance, the researchers hope to spur development of a blood test that can be used to diagnose a variety of cancers at early stages, when treatments can be most effective. The study appeared Feb. 5, 2016, in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics. ""Finding a distinctive methylation-based signature is like looking for a spruce tree in a pine forest,"" said Laura Elnitski, Ph.D., a computational biologist in the Division of Intramural Research at NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). ""It's a technical challenge to identify, but we found an elevated methylation signature around the gene known as ZNF154 that is unique to tumors."" Dr. Elnitski is head of the Genomic Functional Analysis Section and senior investigator in the Translational and Functional Genomics Branch at NHGRI. ""Finding the methylation signature was an incredibly arduous and valuable process,"" said NHGRI Scientific Director Dan Kastner, M.D., Ph.D. ""These findings could be an important step in developing a test to identify early cancers through a blood test.""

Living systems are achieved by complex chemical reaction dynamics far from equilibrium, such as gene expression networks, signalling networks, metabolic circuits and neural networks,  explain Masahiro Takinoue at Tokyo Institute of Technology and his colleagues. The researchers now demonstrate that their microdroplet system can offer the control over chemical fluxes needed to keep this kind of reaction far from equilibrium. Takinoue and his colleagues used a microfluidic system containing a droplet of water in oil with electrodes either side as the chemical reaction site. They then passed a train of water-in-oil droplets past the reactor droplet. As each droplet passed the reactor droplet, applying an A.C. voltage across the electrodes led to fusion, allowing chemical exchange. The shear force of the droplet train then caused fission, leaving the reactor droplet self-contained until voltage-induced fusion with the following droplet. The research team mathematically modelled how by switching the A.C. voltage on and off they could control the fusion/fission timing, and hence the chemical flux and reaction dynamics. As a model system, they then produced a microdroplet system of bromite (BrO3-), sulphite (SO32-) and ferrocyanide (Fe(CN)64-). The pH in the droplet oscillates as hydrogen cations are produced and consumed through autocatalytic reactions. Using pH-sensitive fluorescent molecules, the researchers could monitor these reaction dynamics and incorporate feedback.  Complicated microfluidic components, such as valves and mixers, are unnecessary,  point out the researchers, as the a.c. voltage pulse-modulated reactor provides chemical flux control. In addition the fast fusion response to the applied electric field allows a range of waveforms of the droplet train density to be studied, including sinusoidal, square and saw tooth. As a result it could provide a powerful tool for studying synthetic biology to understand life, as well as bio-inspired self-controlling and dynamic systems.","Published: February 9, 2016"

The more lesions spotted on an MRI, the worse the taste function of the patient, the multi-institutional team reported in the Journal of Neurology. The researchers, including lead author Richard Doty, PhD, director of Penn's Smell and Taste Center and professor of Psychology in Otorhinolaryngology: Head and Neck Surgery at Penn's Perelman School of Medicine, administered a standard taste test (sweet, sour, bitter, and salty) to 73 MS patients and 73 controls subjects, along with MRI of 52 brain regions known to be impacted by MS in both groups. See Also: First study of brain activation in multiple sclerosis using fNIRS They found that the neurological disease significantly influenced the ability to identify tastes, especially salty and sweet. Fifteen to 32 percent of MS patients which is nearly twice as high as previous studies found had taste scores below the 5th percentile of controls. What's more, taste scores were inversely correlated with lesion amounts and volumes in the large sectors of the frontal and temporal lobes, the higher regions of the brain, identified on the MRI. ""This study represents the most comprehensive study preformed to date on the influences of MS on the ability to taste,"" Doty said. ""It appears that a sizable number of these patients exhibit taste deficits, more so than originally thought. This suggests that altered taste function, though less noticeable than changes in vision, is a relatively common feature in MS. ""These findings give us a better insight about that relationship, as well as the areas of the brain that are more likely to impact the dysfunction when scarred from the disease."" Common symptoms associated with MS include vision loss (optic neuritis), a hallmark symptom of MS, fatigue, facial pain and cognitive difficulties, among others; however, the connection between taste problems and MS is less clear and reportedly rare. Some studies put the number as low as five percent and as high as 20 percent, though many were self-reported accounts or included smaller number of patients with little detail about testing. Also, patients often mistake olfactory issues with taste problems, skewing the numbers. Importantly, the correlation between taste dysfunction and the myelin-related lesions which are caused by the nerve damage from the disease has not been made. Isabelle A. Tourbier, a researcher in the department of Otolaryngology: Head and Neck Surgery and Smell and Taste Center at Penn, and Jayaram K. Udupa, PhD, chief of the Medical Imaging section in the department of Radiology at Penn, are co-authors on the study. The team also included researchers from Johns Hopkins University, Michigan State University, Columbia University, Izmir Institute of Technology in Turkey, and the Henry Jackson Foundation. MS affects the central nervous system, with more than 450,000 people in the United States living with the autoimmune disease, making it among the most common neurological illnesses in North America. Although MS can appear at any age, it most commonly begins between the ages of 20 and 40, and affects women twice as often as men. For the taste tests, concentrations of each of the four tastes were pipetted on the left and right sides of the front and back of the tongue for a total of 96 tests for each of the participants. Each identified the taste (sweet, salt, bitter, sour) and graded each test on a scale from ""very weak"" to ""very strong."" Learn More: One step closer to cell therapy for multiple sclerosis patients Based on the tests, the percentage of MS patients with identification scores falling the below the 5th percentile of the controls was 15.07 percent for caffeine, 21.9 percent for citric acid, 24.66 percent for sucrose, and 31.50 percent for sodium chloride, the researchers found. Such scores were inversely correlated with lesion volumes in the brain, including temporal, medial frontal, and superior frontal lobes, and the number of lesions in the left and right superior frontal lobes, right anterior cingulate gyrus, and left parietal operculum. Regardless of subject group, women outperformed men on taste measures, which mirrors what previous taste studies have found. It is likely due to the fact that women have more taste papillae and taste buds than men, the researchers note.

The new study, published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, proposes a new biomarker for cognitive aging and Alzheimer's disease: activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), the levels of which can be easily monitored in routine blood tests. The study also found that ADNP levels tested in the blood correlate with higher IQ in healthy older adults. The research was led by Prof. Illana Gozes, the incumbent of the Lily and Avraham Gildor Chair for the Investigation of Growth Factors and former director of the Adams Super Center for Brain Studies at TAU's Sackler Faculty of Medicine and a member of TAU's Sagol School of Neuroscience, conducted by TAU PhD student Anna Malishkevich and spearheaded by Dr. Gad Marshall, Dr. Aaron Schultz, and Prof. Reisa Sperling of Harvard University, and Prof. Judith Aharon-Peretz of Rambam Medical Center - The Technion Institute of Technology. Significant increases in ADNP RNA levels were observed in patients ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's dementia. ADNP levels tested in plasma and serum samples, as well as white blood cell RNA levels, distinguished among cognitively normal elderly, MCI, and Alzheimer's dementia participants. For the purpose of the cross-sectional study, the investigators analyzed blood samples taken from 42 healthy adults, MCI patients, and Alzheimer's disease patients at Rambam Medical Center in Israel. After comparing the ADNP expression in the blood samples, the researchers prepared plasma samples and once again compared the protein levels. ""This study has provided the basis to detect this biomarker in routine, non-invasive blood tests, and it is known that early intervention is invaluable to Alzheimer's patients,"" said Prof. Gozes. ""We are now planning to take these preliminary findings forward into clinical trials to create a pre-Alzheimer's test that will help to tailor potential preventative treatments."" This new research is based on Prof. Gozes' earlier investigation of neuronal plasticity and nerve cell protection at the molecular, cellular, and system level, and her discovery of novel families of proteins, including ADNP, associated with cross-communication among neural nerve cells and their support cells. Prof. Gozes focused on the potential utility of blood ADNP levels as an Alzheimer's biomarker. ""The more ADNP RNA found in the blood cells, the fewer aggregates found in the brain of elderly cognitively normal individuals,"" said Prof. Gozes. ""Interestingly, we also found that the more ADNP in the serum, the higher the person's IQ level."" Learn More: Novel biomarker predicts febrile seizure-related epilepsy, study finds These findings are corroborated by a separate study by an independent group that found that the ADNP protein is present in lesser quantities in serum samples from select mild Alzheimer's disease patients. However, in Prof. Gozes' studies, which approach advanced Alzheimer's disease patients, the ADNP mRNA levels in white blood cells dramatically rose above the levels measured in cognitively normal individuals. This finding suggests that dramatically increased ADNP mRNA blood levels in Alzheimer's patients may be either insufficient or damaging. ""We have found a clear connection between ADNP levels in the blood and amyloid plaques in the brain,"" said Prof. Gozes. ""Our study is the first to assess ADNP in elderly individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease, and its results open the door for further validation in larger, more informative studies.""

The study, led by the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest Health Sciences, found that younger and older adults show very different brain wave patterns when performing the same memory task. The study is published online in the journal Neurobiology of Learning and Memory. See Also: Is there a connection between heavy metals and aging? ""We know that our brains change over time, but fully understanding how we make and recall memories as we age has been a mystery,"" said Renante Rondina, a University of Toronto and Rotman graduate student in the Department of Psychology and lead author of the study. ""Our findings are really novel as they show distinct differences in brain activity from one generation to the next. By mapping these key differences, we may be able to identify new ways to predict, diagnose and screen for cognitive decline."" The findings show that rhythmic activity within key regions of the brain, including the hippocampus, an area that is involved with the formation and retrieval of memories, and the neocortex, the gray matter ""wrapping paper"" of the brain which is concerned with sight, hearing, attention, and high-level thinking, change with advanced age. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which measures the anatomy and structural integrity of the brain, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), which measures magnetic fields created by the brain's electrical activity, were used to track potential age-related differences as groups of younger and older adults performed a memory task. The median ages of the two groups were 24.8 and 65.9 years, respectively. Rondina explained that brains are made up of billions of cells, which use electricity to communicate with each other. As signals are sent from one cell to the next, rhythmic patterns of electrical activity are generated. ""Past studies have shown that brain waves travelling at slower speeds tend to be important for memory, while slightly faster speed brain waves play a role in our attention,"" said Rondina. ""Other studies have looked at brain wave patterns as we process and recall memories, but our study is one of the first to look at key differences between younger and older adults' brain waves as they make and recall new memories."" Learn More: High-fat diet postpones brain aging in mice While participant accuracy in the memory tasks was consistent across both groups, younger adults showed a surge in theta power (slower brain waves) that was predictive of their memory accuracy. In contrast, older adults demonstrated a rush of alpha oscillatory power (relatively faster brain waves) that was not observed in younger adults. ""It's remarkable to see how different the older participants' brain patterns are from the younger participants, while still maintaining accuracy,"" said Rondina. ""According to the MRIs, there were minimal differences in the brain structures in the two groups, yet the brain waves were very different. With additional study, these results may lead to new, more sensitive ways of screening or diagnosing cognitive decline."" Rondina says the study's results do not immediately change diagnosis or treatment options for age-related cognitive impairments, but it will be interesting to see the long-term implications of these results, as we continue to learn how our brains change as we age.

By focusing on first-degree family members of MS patients, the research team seeks to better understand the sequence of events that leads some people to develop the disease. Their work also sets the stage for developing and testing interventions with which to block the onset of MS. The research team introduces the Genes and Environment in Multiple Sclerosis (GEMS) project, a large prospective natural history study, in a publication in the Annals of Neurology. ""Early detection of MS means the possibility of earlier treatment, which could delay the accumulation of disability,"" said co-senior author Phil De Jager, MD, PhD, who directs the Program in Translational NeuroPsychiatric Genomics at the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at BWH. ""Our long-term goal is to map out the sequence of events leading from health to disease, in order to be able to identify and intervene early in individuals at high-risk of MS."" See Also: New MRI technique offers faster diagnosis of multiple sclerosis The GEMS study leverages the outreach efforts of patient advocacy groups such as the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, social media tools such as Facebook and electronic communication to recruit first-degree relatives (parent, sibling or child) of people who have been diagnosed with MS. More than 2,600 family members have been recruited from across the U.S. Family members can interact with the study via its Facebook page where updates on the project and MS-related news are shared. The study, which will ultimately enroll 5,000 first-degree relatives, will continue for the next 20 years. ""This first report from the GEMS study is important because it shows that we can recruit the large number of family members that is necessary to perform a well-powered study of MS risk factors,"" said lead author Zongqi Xia, PhD, of BWH's Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases. Upon enrollment in the study, participants completed a web-based questionnaire about their medical history, family history, environmental exposures and more. Participants also submitted a saliva sample for DNA extraction. ""Since the disease likely starts many years before the first symptom appears, we do not yet understand how genetic and environmental risk factors come together to trigger MS,"" said co-senior author Daniel Reich, MD, PhD, of the Division of Neuroimmunology and Neurovirology at the NINDS. ""When a patient comes to see a neurologist for the first time, the process of brain inflammation is well underway, since many lesions have few or no symptoms."" Although first-degree relatives are 20 to 40 times more likely to develop MS than the general population, their risk is still low: the researchers estimate that of 10,000 first-degree relatives, only about 62 will be diagnosed with MS over five years. Having a means to predict who is most at risk for developing MS not only means opportunity for early intervention, but also makes clinical trials for new treatments more feasible since the incidence of MS is low in the general population. Learn More: Pathological progression of multiple sclerosis documented for the first time In their preliminary analysis, the research team tested a method to calculate an individual's risk of MS, and identified a subset of family members that may have a higher risk of developing MS than the average family member.

We do not yet have a tool that we can use clinically to predict MS. To develop such tools further, and to develop a platform for testing strategies to prevent the disease altogether, we are expanding GEMS into a larger collaborative study that will accelerate the progress of discovery and bring together a community of investigators to overcome this important challenge,"" says De Jager.

The most effective therapies for MS will ultimately be those that prevent its onset, as halting inflammation and disease progression are much more difficult once the disease has become established.""

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/switch-lets-salmonella-fight-evade-immune-system-210869,Switch Lets Salmonella Fight  Evade Immune System Researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago have discovered a molecular regulator that allows salmonella bacteria to switch from actively causing disease to lurking in a chronic but asymptomatic state called a biofilm  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Biofilms cling to surfaces in the body, such as the bronchial tubes or artificial joints, often without causing illness. But they can be a reservoir of bacteria that detach and cause disease or infect new hosts. The biofilms are resistant to host defenses and antibiotics because their tightly-packed structure exposes little surface area for drugs to reach. Many pathogenic bacteria are able to switch from an infectious to a dormant state as a strategy for survival inside their hosts. Linda Kenney, professor of microbiology and immunology at the UIC College of Medicine and lead author of the study, had been studying how salmonella survive inside immune system cells called macrophages. These white blood cells patrol the body and engulf viruses and bacteria they encounter. They encase their prey in a bubble called a vacuole that protects them from the invader until it can be destroyed. Macrophages digest their quarry when the acidity inside the vacuole drops in response to the captive. But the bacteria have evolved a unique defense, enabling them to survive inside the vacuole and use the macrophage as a Trojan horse to travel elsewhere in the body undetected by other immune cells. Kenney knew that a type of salmonella that causes typhoid fever in humans, called Salmonella typhi, and its mouse counterpart, Salmonella typhimurium, were able to survive inside macrophage vacuoles. She noticed that these bacteria did two things: inside the vacuole, they formed a kind of syringe - a long, hollow filament to inject the vacuole with a host of proteins that altered it. They also quickly assumed the same acidity of the vacuole. ""These two defenses, together, allow salmonella to survive and replicate in the harsh conditions of the vacuole,"" Kenney said. Further experiments revealed that sensing and mirroring the acidity, or pH, of the vacuole is what triggers salmonella to form the syringe. ""The syringe-forming and pH-adjusting genes are signaled to turn on by the lower pH inside the vacuole,"" Kenney said. But these same salmonella, equipped to survive the hostile environment inside a macrophage vacuole, were also able to exist free in the body of the host -- as biofilms. ""I wanted to know how Salmonella 'decide' between these two very different lifestyles,"" Kenney said. Studying S. typhimurium, Kenney discovered that the molecular switch is a bacterial molecule called SsrB. As the macrophage vacuole starts to acidify, SsrB is activated and it turns on the genes needed to form the syringe and adjust the pH. When salmonella lives outside the vacuole, where pH levels are neutral, SsrB instead turns on genes for sticky proteins in the membrane that help bacteria bind to one another to form biofilms. Kenney said that many disease-causing salmonella evolved from harmless strains partly by acquiring new genes from other germs in a process called horizontal gene transfer. ""Salmonella acquired their pH-adjusting and syringe-forming genes in this way, as well as the switch that turns them on and off - SsrB,"" she said. ""The default mode, or its ancestral program, dictates that it make biofilms, cause no illness, and survive long enough to infect new hosts when the opportunity arises. The new genes allow it to survive the host's main defense -- the acidifying macrophage vacuole."" Understanding how bacteria switch from the disease-causing state to the biofilm state could help scientists develop anticancer drugs that encourage the formation of biofilms on tumors, Kenney said. ""When salmonella forms biofilms on tumors, it releases TNF-alpha, a powerful anti-tumor molecule,"" she said. ""If we can better control the formation of biofilms, we can target them to tumors for cancer therapy.""","Published: February 8, 2016"

This represents a follow-on investment from the Foundation based on the achievement of predefined, success-based milestones with the development program for a novel pneumococcal vaccine based on Affinivax s Multiple Antigen Presentation System (MAPS) platform. Proceeds from the funding will be used by Affinivax to advance its lead MAPS vaccine targeting Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) towards clinical testing. Affinivax is utilizing its novel Multiple Antigen Presentation System (MAPS) vaccine technology, developed initially at Boston Children s Hospital, to develop and commercialize a MAPS vaccine targeting Streptococcus pneumoniae.  MAPS overcomes the limitations of current conjugate vaccine technology, in which protection is limited to only 13 pneumococcal serotypes (or strains). In addition to offering a much simpler and cost-efficient manufacturing process, the MAPS vaccine is designed to provide broader protection against both invasive disease as well as colonization and disease transmission   offering the potential to protect against all pneumococcal serotypes. These advantages have been confirmed in early product development and preclinical testing.  This additional investment from the Gates Foundation validates the excellent progress we have made since we founded the company last year,  said Steven B. Brugger, CEO of Affinivax.  Based on the robust data from preclinical trials, demonstrating protection against both invasive disease and colonization, we will now advance our final vaccine candidate towards IND submission and proof-of-concept in clinical testing. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with the Gates Foundation to develop vaccines that can have a potential global impact on infectious disease.  Affinivax received an initial $4 million investment from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in October 2014 which was announced in conjunction with the launch of Affinivax. Proceeds from the initial funding, along with the additional investment announced today, will be used to develop Affinivax s MAPS technology platform and enable the development of novel vaccines for global impact to protect children and adults in both the developed and developing worlds, with an initial focus on the company s lead pneumococcal vaccine. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a bacterium frequently found in the upper respiratory tract of healthy children and adults, and can cause serious infections ranging from pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis, representing a major global health problem. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 1.6 million people, including more than 800,000 children under 5 years old, die every year from pneumococcal infections, with most of these deaths occurring in low-resource countries. The U.S. Center for Disease Control estimates that about 900,000 cases occur in the U.S. alone, resulting in up to 400,000 hospitalizations and 50,000 deaths annually.

When Californians file their state income taxes, there is a section near the end of the form that lists voluntary contribution funds. If you normally skip right past this section, give it a closer look this year: two of the funds looking for contributions are highly regarded cancer research programs administered by the University of California, the California Breast Cancer Research Fund and the California Cancer Research Fund. The voluntary contributions to date have had a real impact in the fight against cancer, supporting research and education to improve detection, treatment and access to care in California and beyond. Next-generation diagnosis With funding from the California Cancer Research Fund, administered by UC's Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program (TRDRP), researchers are working on better ways to detect cancer early, easily and accurately. Being able to diagnose and characterize cancers from a simple blood test, a so-called  liquid biopsy,  could revolutionize cancer treatment. Xiaohe Liu of SRI International in Menlo Park describes this approach as  the Holy Grail of cancer diagnostics.  The liquid biopsy isn t a distant dream: Liu s research is helping make it a reality, using an innovative technology called FAST (Fiber-optic Array Scanning Technology) to detect circulating tumor cells in the bloodstream, even at very low concentrations. This approach could increase survival rates and largely eliminate traditional biopsies, which are costly, invasive and take an emotional and physical toll on patients. The low cost will also make this technology accessible to disproportionately impacted patients in low-income communities. Avoiding cancer-causing compounds The best cure for cancer is to avoid it in the first place. The research led by Shanaz Dairkee at the Pacific Medical Center and Polly Marshall at Breast Cancer Over Time, funded by the California Breast Cancer Research Program, is looking into whether women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by stopping the use of personal care products that contain chemicals known to mimic estrogens in the body. These so-called ""xenoestrogens,"" which include phthalates and parabens, have been linked to mammary cancer in rodents and shown to cause pre-cancerous changes in human breast cell cultures. Despite those findings, they are prevalent in many personal care products.  XEs are abundant in common personal care items such as soap, shampoo, deodorant, body lotion, moisturizer, sunscreen, perfume, and facial makeup,  said Dairkee.  A number of studies show a decline in XE levels in the urine and blood of volunteers if they avoid the use of certain personal care products, as well as plastic food and beverage containers,  explained Dairkee.  Does such  detoxification  lead to cellular reprogramming whereby XE-susceptible tissues are purged of the earliest cancer precursors? Or are the deleterious effects of XE exposure upon the breast relatively fixed, but only in some, not all individuals?  Dairkee and Marshall s study plans to measure the impact of decreased exposure to xenoestrogens from personal care products on healthy human breast cells, leading to better understanding of what we should and shouldn t be putting on our bodies. Lowering barriers to care Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. among both men and women. The newest methods of screening for lung cancer, such as low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening, can significantly reduce mortality rates. But if patients don t have access to quality care, don t seek it in the first place, or can t communicate well with their doctors, improved screening won't reach all who could benefit from it.  How can we provide information to patients in the best possible way?  asks UCSF s Celia Kaplan. With funding from the California Cancer Research Fund, Kaplan aims to find out.  There are pros and cons with LDCT screening, so the physician and patient have to really be in communication,  said Kaplan.  There are other large barriers to care, including insurance, fear of cancer, stigma, and the availability of infrastructure to do the test and the necessary follow-ups.  Kaplan s research is surveying the barriers to care across California with the goal of providing clear recommendations and tools that will improve communication and increase screening. While studies like this on access to care can have a large effect on improving health outcomes, funding can be hard to come by.  The TRDRP is the first funding agency to take this research seriously and set aside the funds,  said Kaplan.","Published: February 8, 2016"

In a last-ditch effort, Bob s owner enrolled him in a clinical trial to receive a novel stem cell therapy treatment. Luckily for Bob and many other cats in the trial, the approach worked and Bob went on to live a normal, pain-free life. (He died several months ago of causes unrelated to FCGS.)  This is the first study to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of using this type of stem cell therapy for a naturally occurring, chronic inflammatory disease in cats,  said the study s lead author, Boaz Arzi, a veterinary dental surgeon at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Arzi first became interested in starting the clinical trial after seeing cats who had all or nearly all of their teeth removed to treat FCGS, but who still experienced the pain and suffering of the disease even after several courses of corticosteroids and antibiotics following teeth removal.  FCGS is a challenging disease to treat, and we were frustrated that some cats wouldn t respond to traditional treatment,  Arzi said.  We were banging our heads against the wall and this stem cell therapy was a last resort.  The technique involves taking a cat s own fat-derived stem cells, processing and characterizing them, and then giving them back intravenously to reduce inflammation and promote tissue regeneration. The study also identified a potentially useful biomarker that could determine if cats will respond to stem cell treatment.  We re the first researchers to come up with this patent-pending technique for any mammals, including humans,  Arzi said. Hope for humans too As a naturally occurring animal disease, FCGS also has the potential to serve as a useful model for the treatment of human chronic oral inflammatory disease   an approach increasingly known as  One Health.  Nasim Fazel, a board-certified dermatologist and dentist at the UC Davis Health System and co-author on the paper, has been working collaboratively with the veterinary medicine team to perform comparative studies between histopathologic characteristics and blood inflammatory biomarkers of FCGS and various chronic oral inflammatory conditions in humans such as oral lichen planus, aphthous stomatitis and vesiculobullous diseases.  Oral lichen planus, like FCGS, is a T-cell-mediated chronic inflammatory mucosal disorder. It bears similarities in disease presentation, clinical course and difficulty of treatment.  I was really excited to hear about their work because the cat disease behaved very similarly to what I saw in my human patients with oral lichen planus,  Fazel said. Based on the success of this research, she recently submitted a grant to establish a human clinical trial to use mesenchymal stem cell therapy to treat oral lichen planus.  We re in desperate need of novel therapies to treat chronic inflammatory mucosal disorders such as OLP, which are challenging to treat and of major impact to patients  quality of life,  Fazel said.  Having this opportunity to translate what we re learning in veterinary medicine to human medicine and working together to bring therapies discovered in the cat model to chronic oral inflammatory diseases in humans is exciting and has great potential.

Its preventive and therapeutic power does not depend on the animals  own immune response to viral infection.  The researchers are trying to address the public health need for better methods to keep flu at bay. Vaccinations can deter flu infections, but they are strain-specific. Flu viruses are notorious for forming new genetic subtypes that can evade vaccines and acquire resistance to antiviral medications. The influenza virus comes in three basic versions of core protein:  A, B, and C. Influenza virus also has thorny projections on  its outer shell: some of these consist of hemagglutinin and the rest of neuraminidase. Each of these proteins has an inner stem that stays pretty constant among different flu strains, and a coat that is prone to change.  These variations roughly help classify flu viruses.  The pandemic of 1918, for example, was an H1N1 flu.  Antibodies   minuscule security agents that chemically apprehend suspicious substances   previously have been developed to bind the less variable inner stems of the hemagglutinin spikes.  Such broadly neutralizing antibodies can be formidable opponents for a variety of flu viruses, but not without engaging one of the body s own disease fighting modalities. Deborah Fuller, a University of Washington associate professor of microbiology, and her colleagues, collaborated with the UW Institute of Protein Design, led by David Baker, to seek alternatives to these antibodies.  They succeeded in the computational design of a small protein that mimicked and even surpassed the binding affinity of the broadly neutralizing antibodies for a target on the flu protein. This designed protein was then tested to see if it could actually fend off flu infections. The protein was designated HB36.6. In mice, HB36.6 was administered through the nose and made its way into the lungs. Facing off with a slew of severe flu viruses, HB36.6 kept the pathogens from copying enough of themselves. Several experiments showed that the designed protein strongly fought off impending flu and was also useful in flu treatment. The designed protein prevented infection when given in a single dose up to 48 hours before flu virus exposure, and prevented disease when given daily after exposure.  The protein molecule accomplished this without the immune system cooperation the antibodies required. This is a significant distinction because antiviral developers want to avoid exacerbating inflammation that can make flu symptoms worse.  They also want an antiviral that does a good job in infants, the elderly and others with weakened immune responses. In a comparison study, the small protein outperformed the common anti-flu drug oseltamivir, brand name Tamiflu. A single dose of HB36.6 given the day after exposure to the virus offered better protection than 10 doses of oseltamivir given twice daily for five days. The two antivirals combined had an even better effect, further improving protection when compared to either drug alone. The results overall, according to the researchers, show the computationally designed protein had potent anti-viral efficacy and suggest the potential for developing a new class of antivirals for flu. The use of computational modeling to design such protein molecules is a new paradigm in drug discovery that may also lead to strategies against other viral diseases. The research was funded with grants from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the Life Science Discovery Fund, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Sciences Foundation.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genomic-signature-shared-by-five-types-of-cancer-196064,Genomic Signature Shared by Five Types of Cancer National Institutes of Health researchers have identified a striking signature in tumor DNA that occurs in five different types of cancer   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. They also found evidence that this methylation signature may be present in many more types of cancer. The specific signature results from a chemical modification of DNA called methylation, which can control the expression of genes like a dimmer on a light switch. Higher amounts of DNA methylation (hypermethylation), like that found by the researchers in some tumor DNA, decreases a gene's activity. Based on this advance, the researchers hope to spur development of a blood test that can be used to diagnose a variety of cancers at early stages, when treatments can be most effective.   Finding a distinctive methylation-based signature is like looking for a spruce tree in a pine forest,  said Laura Elnitski, Ph.D., a computational biologist in the Division of Intramural Research  at NIH s National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).  It s a technical challenge to identify, but we found an elevated methylation signature around the gene known as ZNF154 that is unique to tumors.  Dr. Elnitski is head of the Genomic Functional Analysis Section and senior investigator in the Translational and Functional Genomics Branch at NHGRI. In 2013, her research group discovered a methylation mark (or signature) around ZNF154 in 15 tumor types in 13 different organs and deemed it a possible universal cancer biomarker. Biomarkers are biological molecules that indicate the presence of disease. Dr. Elnitski s group identified the methylation mark using DNA taken from solid tumors.   No one in my group slept the night after that discovery,  Dr. Elnitski said.  We were so excited when we found this candidate biomarker. It s the first of its kind to apply to so many types of cancer.  In this new study, they developed a series of steps that uncovered telltale methylation marks in colon, lung, breast, stomach and endometrial cancers. They showed that all the tumor types and subtypes consistently produced the same methylation mark around ZNF154. ""Finding the methylation signature was an incredibly arduous and valuable process,"" said NHGRI Scientific Director Dan Kastner, M.D., Ph.D.  These findings could be an important step in developing a test to identify early cancers through a blood test.  The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center sequenced the tumor DNA that had been amplified using a technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Dr. Elnitski and her group then analyzed the results, finding elevated levels of methylation at ZNF154 across the different tumor types. To verify the connection between increased methylation and cancer, Dr. Elnitski s group developed a computer program that looked at the methylation marks in the DNA of people with and without cancer. By feeding this information into the program, they were able to predict a threshold for detecting tumor DNA. Even when they reduced the amount of methylated molecules by 99 percent, the computer could still detect the cancer-related methylation marks in the mixture. Knowing that tumors often shed DNA into the bloodstream, they calculated the proportions of circulating tumor DNA that could be found in the blood. Next steps Dr. Elnitski will next begin screening blood samples from patients with bladder, breast, colon, pancreatic and prostate cancers to determine the accuracy of detection at low levels of circulating DNA. Tumor DNA in a person with cancer typically comprises between 1 and 10 percent of all DNA circulating in the bloodstream. The group noted that when 10 percent of the circulating DNA contains the tumor signature, their detection rate is quite good. Because the methylation could be detected at such low levels, it should be adequate to detect advanced cancer as well as some intermediate and early tumors, depending on the type. Dr. Elnitski s group will also collaborate with Christina Annunziata, M.D., Ph.D., an investigator in the Women's Malignancies Branchand head of the Translational Genomics Section at NIH s National Cancer Institute (NCI). They will test blood samples from women with ovarian cancer to validate the process over the course of treatment and to determine if this type of analysis leads to improved detection of a recurrence and, ultimately, improved outcomes.  Ovarian cancer is difficult to detect in its early stages, and there are no proven early detection methods,  said Dr. Annunziata.  We need a reliable biomarker for detecting the disease when a cure is more likely. We are looking forward to testing Dr. Elnitski s novel approach using DNA methylation signatures.  Current blood tests are specific to a known tumor type. In other words, clinicians must first find the tumor, remove a sample of it and determine its genome sequence. Once the tumor-specific mutations are known, they can be tracked for appearance in the blood. The potential of the new approach is that no prior knowledge of cancer is required, it would be less intrusive than other screening approaches like colonoscopies and mammograms and it could be used to follow individuals at high risk for cancer or to monitor the activity of a tumor during treatment. Once the blood test is developed, the scientific community must conduct studies to ensure that it does not indicate the presence of cancer when it is not there or miss cancer when it is there. Dr. Elnitski does not yet understand the connection between tumors and elevated DNA methylation. It may represent derailment of normal processes in the cell, or it may have something to do with the fact that tumors consume a lot of energy and circumvent the cellular processes that keep growth in check. Researchers also don t know exactly what the gene ZNF154 does.  We have laid the groundwork for developing a diagnostic test, which offers the hope of catching cancer earlier and dramatically improving the survival rate of people with many types of cancer,  Dr. Elnitski said.","Published: February 8, 2016"

But VRAC s importance to cellular health is just beginning to be understood already it has been tentatively linked to stroke-induced brain damage, diabetes, immune deficiency and even cancer treatment resistance. The scientists showed that VRAC is a complex structure with five different protein subunits the precise mix of which determines its relief-valve properties. The team also determined that VRAC s relief-valve function is activated not by the physical swelling of a cell per se, but by a closely linked event: the low concentration of dissolved ions that results from a sudden flow of water into a cell.  Knowing how VRAC is assembled and how it works is important not only because it is a fundamental regulatory mechanism in cells, but also because it seems to have relevance for a variety of diseases and conditions,  said principal investigator Ardem Patapoutian, a professor at TSRI and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator. Sorting Through the Molecular Soup Scientists discovered VRAC s existence decades ago, but only recently began to identify its components. In early 2014, Patapoutian s laboratory and a separate group in Germany discovered independently that one VRAC subunit is a protein called LRRC8A (SWELL1), which is necessary for VRAC to function properly. It was apparent at the time, however, that VRAC has other subunits. In the new study, Patapoutian and his team sought a more complete understanding of how VRAC is put together and how it senses volume changes. Knowing that LRRC8A is always present in VRAC, co-first author Zhaozhu Qiu, a postdoctoral fellow in the Patapoutian lab and at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF), created test cells that produce LRRC8A with a special protein tag attached. The tagged LRRC8A were used as a handle to pull the full VRAC complex out of the molecular soup contained in cells. Co-first author Ruhma Syeda, also a postdoctoral fellow in the Patapoutian lab, led the effort to put purified VRAC complexes into model cell membranes (lipid bilayers) to measure the conductance of charged ions. The results were startling. Although an ion channel typically has a sharply defined single channel conductance, measurements of VRAC suggested a broad range of conductances. Prior research had suggested that the VRAC structure can include other members of the LRRC8 family besides LRRC8A, namely LRRC8B, LRRC8C, LRRC8D and/or LRRC8E. Qiu and Stuart Cahalan, another postdoctoral fellow, therefore created a set of cell lines in which genes for one or more of the LRRC8 proteins were deleted. With this and other methods, the team established that VRAC is in fact a diverse family of ion channels, each of which has approximately six protein subunits. At least one subunit of any VRAC structure is LRRC8A, but the other subunits appear to be a variable mix of LRRC8B-E proteins. That variability of composition leads to different charge-flow properties when channel complexes were measured in the minimalistic bilayer system. Swetha Murthy, a postdoctoral fellow, and Adrienne Dubin, an assistant professor of neuroscience (and co-corresponding author), determined that charge-flow properties of single VRAC channels on intact swollen cells were also dictated by the subunit combination.  We speculate that different cell types need different forms of VRAC to cope with their different environments that s an idea we re keen to test,  said Qiu.  This finding also suggests that subtle variations in VRAC s composition can have profound effects on how it works in cells and potentially contributes to disease,  said Patapoutian. How to Sense a Swelling Cell Perhaps the biggest unanswered question about VRAC has been: how does it sense the swelling of a cell?  People have scratched their heads over this for decades, because it s hard to imagine how a cell could directly measure an increase in its volume,  Patapoutian said. One possibility has been that VRAC senses a volume increase indirectly, by detecting the stretching of the cell membrane, as some sensory ion channels do. However, examining VRAC complexes in the simplified environment of lipid bilayers, the team found that they were not activated by membrane stretching. They were, however, readily activated when the usual concentration of dissolved ions was reduced. That made sense.  Local decrease in the ionic strength is an inevitable result when the water rushes in and the cell swells,  Syeda said.","Published: February 8, 2016"

Using an approach developed at Maisonneuve-Rosemont, consisting of an autograft to reduce tumour mass followed by a family allograft three to four months later to clean the bone marrow of myeloma cells with immune cells from a family donor (immunotherapy), the study resulted in a total cure rate of 41%, a record level using this strategy. Moreover, patients in complete remission six months after the allograft had a relapse-free survival rate of 60%. Overall, the autograft strategy followed by allograft resulted in relapse-free survival rates of 20-25% in the long term. ""In many hospitals, doctors have abandoned the use of allografts for multiple myeloma due to the risk of toxicity and relapse. Our results, on the other hand, have led us to offer the treatment to more patients, especially younger patients and those with poorer prognoses,"" said Dr. Roy. Other encouraging data Moreover, in the same study, the mortality rate associated with this treatment over ten years was 10%, an extremely low rate following a family donor allograft. And while 50% of patients experienced a relapse of their myeloma, the subsequent treatment showed marked efficacy: 50% of these patients were alive five years after the relapse. Based on these results, a new study aiming to reduce rates of relapse and complications is currently underway at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, with still preliminary but very encouraging results.","Published: February 8, 2016"

Singlet oxygen molecules (a highly reactive form of oxygen) are able to kill or inhibit growth of cancer cells in the body due to their toxicity. Co-lead author on the paper, Ewa Goldys, Deputy Director of the CNBP and Professor at Macquarie University explained,  Photodynamic therapy is where light sensitive compounds are placed near diseased cells, then activated by light, producing short lived molecular by-products that can destroy or damage the cells being targeted.   In this case, X-rays (a form of light) were used to stimulate cerium fluoride (CeF3) nanoparticles which had been placed near a group of cells. Singlet oxygen was produced as a by-product of the X-ray and CeF3 interaction, which was then successfully measured.  Goldys believes the research is significant, as this is the first time that anyone has been able to quantify accurately, the number of singlet oxygen molecules produced in this type of procedure.  Singlet oxygen molecules are a far more reactive form of oxygen but they can only kill cancer cells if generated in sufficient quantity , said Goldys.  In our testing we established that therapeutic radiation dose X-rays, produce enough singlet oxygen molecules to be effective in photodynamic therapy.  According to Goldys, photodynamic therapy has traditionally utilised near-infrared or visible light which has been unable to penetrate far into the body, limiting its use to cancer treatment, on or near the surface of the skin.  We re looking to target cancer cells deeper in the body hence the use of X-rays, which can really penetrate into deeper levels of tissue, and are already used in medical diagnostic and therapy.  Concluded Goldys,  What we ve shown through our measurements is the applicability of the photodynamic therapy approach to effectively treat tumours within.   The beauty of this type of treatment is that it uses different biological pathways to kill cells as compared to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other current cancer practices.  Deep tissue photodynamic therapy will potentially provide new treatment options for the cancer patients of the future.  Next steps with this research will see differing nanoparticles tested and measured, for effectiveness in singlet oxygen production.","Published: February 8, 2016"

In order to localize proteins and decipher their function in living cells, researchers label them with fluorescent molecules. However, the delivery of protein markers is often insufficient. A group of researchers from the Goethe University, working in close collaboration with US colleagues, has now found a solution for this problem. They report on a process that uses pressure to deliver chemical probes in a fine-tuned manner into living cells. ""Although more and more protein labeling methods utilize synthetic fluorescent dyes, they often suffer from problems such as cell permeability or low labeling efficiency. Moreover, they cannot always be combined with other protein labeling techniques"", explains Dr. Ralph Wieneke from the Institute of Biochemistry at the Goethe University. Recently, the working group led by Wieneke and Prof. Robert Tamp  developed a marker that localizes selected proteins in cells with nanometre precision. This highly specific lock-and-key element consists of the small synthetic molecule trisNTA and a genetically encoded His-tag. In order to deliver this protein marker into cells, the researchers from Frankfurt, together with colleagues from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, USA, applied a procedure in which a mixture of cells together with the marker were forced through narrow constrictions. This process is called cell squeezing. Under pressure, the cells incorporate the fluorescent probes with an efficiency rate greater than 80 percent. In addition, the process enabled to squeeze one million cells per second through the artificial capillary in high-throughput. Since the marker binds very efficiently and specifically to the target protein and its concentration can be precisely regulated within the cell, the researchers were able to record high resolution microscopy images in living cells. Moreover, they were able to trace proteins with the marker only when activated by light. Thus, cellular processes can be observed with high precision in terms of space and time. The researchers can even combine their labeling methods with other protein labeling techniques in living cells to observe several proteins simultaneously in real time. ""Utilizing cell squeezing, we were able to deliver a number of fluorescently labeled trisNTAs in cells. This tremendously expands the scopes of conventional as well as high resolution microscopy in living cells"", explains Prof. Robert Tamp . In future, it will be possible to follow dynamic processes in living cells in time and space at high resolution.","Published: February 8, 2016"

The deal also expands an existing collaboration between the companies to provide Takeda with additional access to Mersana s Fleximer  antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) platform and grants Mersana an option at the end of Phase 1 to co-develop and co-commercialize one of these programs in the United States. In addition, the companies will co-develop new payloads for use with ADCs. XMT-1522 is an investigational, Fleximer-based ADC therapy that targets HER2-expressing tumors, including breast, gastric and non-small cell lung cancers. Preclinical data suggest that XMT-1522 may have anti-tumor activity in patients with HER2 low-expressing cancers as well as in patients with HER2 high-expressing cancers that do not respond to currently available HER2-targeting therapies. Mersana anticipates filing an Investigational New Drug application (IND) for XMT-1522 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in mid-2016.  We believe XMT-1522 has the potential to make a dramatic difference for HER2 low-expressing patients who currently have limited treatment options, and are confident that our Fleximer-based technology can address significant patient needs not currently met by other ADC platform technologies,  said Anna Protopapas, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mersana.  Takeda s knowledge of oncology and commitment to ADCs as a key therapeutic approach make the company the best partner for us to progress our transformative platform and advance XMT-1522 into the clinic.  Takeda and Mersana will co-develop XMT-1522, and Mersana will lead execution of the Phase 1 trial. Mersana will retain full commercial rights in the United States and Canada while Takeda will have rights in rest of world. Beyond development and commercialization of XMT-1522, the expanded partnership also grants Takeda access to additional targets within Mersana s Fleximer-based ADC platform, with Mersana retaining the right to select one program at the end of Phase 1 for co-development and co-commercialization in the United States. Takeda and Mersana will also work together, leveraging Takeda s proprietary small molecule libraries, to identify and develop novel payloads that both parties will be able to use in new ADC therapies.  This is our third collaboration with Mersana in less than two years. We see great potential for Mersana s Fleximer technology, combined with our oncology expertise and resources, to extend the benefits of targeted therapy with ADCs to underserved cancer patient populations,  said Andrew Plump M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical and Scientific Officer, Takeda.  We, along with the global oncology community, have made great strides in our fight against cancer, and we know that achieving our aspiration to cure cancer relies on great partnerships and innovation. We look forward to progressing these collaborations and, together, advancing the science of cancer care.  Takeda signed agreements with Mersana through its wholly owned subsidiary, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., under which, Mersana will receive an upfront payment of $40 million and an additional payment of $20 million upon clearance of the IND for XMT-1522 by the FDA. Subject to the success of the XMT-1522 and ADC programs, Mersana is eligible to receive milestone payments of more than $750 million combined, as well as royalties. Takeda will also invest up to $20 million in equity in future rounds of Mersana financing.","Published: February 8, 2016"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/food-triggers-creation-of-regulatory-t-cells-194831,Food Triggers Creation of Regulatory T Cells IBS researchers document how normal diet establishes immune tolerance conditions in the small intestine  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Our immune system evolved to attack foreign materials entering our body. Food is technically foreign, but it is somehow tolerated by the immune system so that our body can absorb the nutrients. The immune system has built-in tolerance mechanisms that harness itself from responding to benign foreign antigens beneficial to our system, like food. When such tolerance fails, we suffer from an overt immune reaction, such as food allergies, which can be severe enough to be fatal. Despite the increasing incidence and severity of food allergies, the details on how immune tolerance to dietary antigens is normally established remain largely unknown. Scientists from the Academy of Immunology and Microbiology (AIM) within IBS in South Korea have recently uncovered one of the key mechanisms in the small intestine that triggers this process. A key mechanism used by our body to induce immune tolerance is by induction of regulatory T (Treg) cells, a subset of white blood cell that orders other T cells to stand down. In the gut, a special subset of Treg cells, called peripheral Treg (pTreg) cells, exists in both the small and large intestine. Previous research showed that pTreg cells are created in the large intestine in response to the normal commensal intestinal bacteria, which play a vital symbiotic role in our health. pTreg cells were also believed to exist in the small intestine to inform the immune system on which food antigens can enter our body. The IBS research team has now discovered that normal diet does indeed induce the creation of the pTreg cells in the small intestine. Experiments with Mice To determine whether normal food prompts mucosal immunity in the intestines, the research team generated a special type of mice, dubbed  antigen-free  mice that were not used in research since the 1980 s. Through a painstaking process, these antigen-free mice were generated from germ-free parents who are completely devoid of any microorganisms. Like their parents, antigen-free mice are also germ free, but they are also fed a meticulously assembled, ultra-refined  elemental  diet comprised of basic building blocks of life that keeps them alive and healthy, but is free of antigens (macromolecules) that can activate the immune system. In essence, antigen-free mice were generated in order to test whether typical food antigens actually contributed to the development of pTreg cells in the small intestine. The result was that like germ-free mice, the antigen-free mice were depleted of pTreg cells in their colon, but what was new and exciting was that they also lacked pTreg cells in their small intestines. Hence, it became clear that normal dietary antigens were responsible for signaling pTreg cells to be generated at this site. Dietary Evolution: Liquid to Solids To determine how early in ontogeny pTreg cells develop the IBS researchers compared the effect of milk vs. a solid food diet in pre and post-weaned mice. Neonatal mice on milk possessed only a few pTreg cells in the small intestine. Later, when these mice were weaned onto a solid food diet, large numbers of pTreg cells in the small intestine emerged rapidly within a few weeks. However, when neonatal mice were weaned onto an antigen-free elemental diet or a diet free of proteins, but only their amino acid building blocks, they didn t develop pTreg cells in the small intestine. From this they concluded that the majority of pTreg cells in the small intestine develop in response to antigens derived from proteins in a solid food diet. These findings beg the question: Why don t all neonatal mice that haven t had a chance to eat solid food (and develop pTreg cells) immediately get food allergies when weaning off of milk? According to researcher Kwang Soon Kim,  In early life, the intestinal environment is more skewed to generate a tolerogenic response, presumably helped by certain tolerance-inducing components in the milk, and from the rapid generation of pTreg cells upon introduction of solid food.  Hence, mother s milk and newly generated pTreg cells appear to work together to prevent food allergies when toddlers begin to enjoy rice and other solid food. This idea is also supported by the researchers  finding that when neonatal mice were allowed to grow into adults without pTreg cells, i.e., without exposure to solid food, they` become much more susceptible to experimentally induced food allergy. Forward Thinking A recent study from the UK called LEAP (Learning Early About Peanut allergy) set out to prove that  regular eating of peanut-containing products, when started during infancy, will elicit a protective immune response instead of an allergic immune reaction . The results were astounding; 17% of the children who avoided peanut-containing products developed allergies by the age of 5. Remarkably, only 3% of the children who ate peanut-containing products developed allergies by the same age. The trial, taken as a microcosm, confirms AIM s director Surh s assertions,  our data could explain why children suffer from a higher incidence of food allergy than adults and why childhood allergy spontaneously dissipates with time.  With the results from both Korea and the UK the presence of both diet and microbe-induced populations of pTreg cells may be required for the development of complete tolerance to food antigens. Food allergies are on the rise, affecting 1 in every 13 children in America, so it is becoming critical to understand how to control and eliminate allergic responses. While this study didn t focus directly on food hypersensitivity treatments, the antigen-free mice provided a better understanding of the processes involved in food allergies. This work may be a small part of something larger as Professor Surh said,  I believe that dietary antigens might also affect autoimmune diseases in other organs . This work brings us one step closer to understanding how the body s immune response works and what we can do to control it.","Published: February 8, 2016"

Dr Frost was trained at Harvard Medical School and in November started her new laboratory at the UT Health Science Center's Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies. Dr Frost and two co-authors showed for the first time that lamin dysfunction can cause the death of neurons. The team made this finding in a fruit fly disease model initially and confirmed it in postmortem brain tissue of people who had Alzheimer's disease, whose families donated their brains to research. ""Human brain donation is a very critical part of this work,"" Dr Frost said. ""It was important to show that what we found in the fly is really relevant to human disease."" Dr Frost and her colleagues used a technique called super-resolution microscopy to analyze the fruit fly and human specimens. They found peculiar features that looked like tunnels in the lamin of Alzheimer's-affected specimens. A cell nucleus from a normal, healthy brain is shown at left. The lamin nucleoskeleton forms the perimeter around the nucleus. By contrast, tunnel-like anomalies are evident in the nucleus of the Alzheimer's disease-affected cell shown at right.

Inflammation increases the risk for depression. More specifically, inflammation induces behavioral changes similar to depression that are often associated with illness, including fatigue, difficulty concentrating, lack of motivation, and reduced experience of pleasure. See Also: New evidence reveals link between brain inflammation and major depression The authors recruited 23 patients with hepatitis C who were beginning treatment with interferon-alpha (INF- ). This treatment provokes an immediate inflammatory response, confirmed by measuring cytokines in the blood. Four hours after INF-  administration, a specialized type of imaging, called magnetization transfer imaging, was performed that showed evidence of microstructural changes in the striatum when compared to scans conducted prior to INF-  administration. This suggests that the striatum is highly sensitive to IFN- . IFN-  also induced fatigue and depression in the patients, particularly over weeks 4 through 12 of treatment. Interestingly, the early striatal structural change predicted the later emergence of fatigue, but not depression, in the study participants. Changes in the striatum were heterogeneous with some changes associated with the risk for fatigue, while other changes seemed to be protective against developing fatigue. ""Inflammation-related fatigue and depression are big clinical problems,"" said Dr. John Krystal, Editor of Biological Psychiatry. ""This study highlights that the brain regions central to reward and motivation are directly altered by inflammation in ways that that appear to predispose or protect against developing fatigue but not depression.

Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) neuroscientists say rest for more than a day is critical for allowing the brain to reset neural networks and repair any short-term injury. The new study in mice also shows that repeated mild concussions with only a day to recover between injuries leads to mounting damage and brain inflammation that remains evident a year after injury. See Also: Comprehensive concussion literature analysis lays foundation for evidence-based guidelines ""It is good news that the brain can recover from a hit if given enough time to rest and recover. But on the flip side, we find that the brain does not undertake this rebalancing when impacts come too close together,"" says the study's lead researcher, Mark P Burns, PhD, assistant professor of neuroscience at GUMC and director of the Laboratory for Brain Injury and Dementia. This first-of-its-kind study, published in the March 2016 issue of American Journal of Pathology, modeled repeated mild head trauma as a means to investigate brain damage that occurs after a sports, military or domestic abuse injury.

Children with Down syndrome who have motor speech disorder characteristics have historically been diagnosed as having childhood dysarthria. Meanwhile, symptoms of childhood apraxia of speech may have been missed based on the assumption that they coud not have both disorders. The study, published in the International Journal of Speech-Language Pathology, provides evidence that children can have both motor speech disorders. See Also: Brain area that integrates speech s rhythms found Shelley Velleman, chair of the Department of Communications Sciences and Disorders at the University of Vermont, and her colleagues conducted motor speech assessments on seven children with Down syndrome in comparison with typically developing children. They also analyzed the motor speech and non-speech oral motor skills of all participants using an investigator checklist of characteristics of apraxia, dysarthria as well as other non-specified motor speech disorders. The results support Velleman's hypothesis that children with Down syndrome who exhibit symptoms of both disorders can, in fact, have overlapping symptoms, and should be treated for all of them. ""Children have been automatically placed in one of those boxes,"" Velleman says, ""when the reality is that many kids have a combination, so you have to look at all of the symptoms and treat the child accordingly or it's not going to be very helpful."" The finding is especially significant because of the different ways in which speech pathologists work with children who have apraxia compared to those with dysarthria. Therapy for dysarthria, a neuromotor disorder, is largely compensatory because the motor pathways are damaged and cannot be repaired. Consequently, clinicians teach techniques that increase intelligibility or clarity of speech. Conversely, most individuals with apraxia benefit more from therapy focusing on motor planning training as opposed to compensation. ""With dysarthria, kids' brains know what to do, but they can't carry it out because the muscles they use to speak have low tone or are weak,"" says Velleman. ""With apraxia the muscles can do it, but it's a matter of the brain not being able to communicate with the muscles. So if you took a kid with apraxia and you worked on dysarthria to try to get a nice strong ""S"" sound, well that's nice, but they won't be able to do it when they need to."" Velleman advises therapists to treat the symptoms they see regardless of the diagnosis. ""The most important thing is to figure out the symptoms,"" she says. ""If they have three symptoms of dysarthria, three of apraxia and three of something else like a phonological disorder, don't worry about an official diagnosis; go ahead and treat all of the symptoms.""

In a new study that appears in The FASEB Journal, scientists show that a gene called ""DISC1,"" which is believed to play a role in mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and some forms of depression, influences the function of pancreatic beta cells which produce insulin to maintain normal blood glucose levels. See Also: Study shows long-term effects of type 2 diabetes on the brain, thinking ""Studies exploring the biology of disease have increasingly identified the involvement of unanticipated proteins DISC1 fits this category,"" said Rita Bortell, PhD, a researcher involved in the work from the Diabetes Center of Excellence at the Universityof Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts. ""Our hope is that the association we've found linking disrupted DISC1 to both diabetes and psychiatric disorders may uncover mechanisms to improve therapies, even preventative ones, to alleviate suffering caused by both illnesses which are extraordinarily costly, very common, often quite debilitating."" To make their discovery, Bortell and colleagues studied the function of DISC1 by comparing two groups of mice. The first group was genetically manipulated to disrupt the DISC1 gene only in the mouse's pancreatic beta cells. The second group of mice was normal. The mice with disrupted DISC1 gene showed increased beta cell death, less insulin secretion and impaired glucose regulation while control mice were normal. The researchers found that DISC1 works by controlling the activity of a specific protein (GSK3 ) already known to be critical for beta cell function and survival. Inhibition of GSK3  resulted in improved beta cell survival and restored normal glucose tolerance in mice with disrupted DISC1. Alterations in the DISC1 gene were originally associated with increased risk of schizophrenia, but further studies have also found DISC1 alterations in individuals with bipolar disorder and major depression.

The scientists conducted a series of experiments on male mice and published their findings in the journal Frontiers in Neuroscience. Researchers from the Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (ICG SB RAS), MIPT, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and Stony Brook University and School of Medicine studied the changes that occurred in the brains of mice demonstrating aggressive behavior, which attacked other mice and won in fights. After a win, these mice became even more aggressive, and new neurons appeared in their hippocampus. In addition to this, in mice that were allowed to continue fighting certain changes were observed in the activity of their nerve cells. The scientists hope that the new information on the neurobiological bases of aggression will not only help in understanding this important phenomenon, but will also encourage research in other areas and even help in finding causes of autism and other similar disorders in humans. See Also: Neurobiologists find chronic stress in early life causes anxiety, aggression in adulthood In order to explain exactly how aggression affects the formation of new neurons, how it alters the functioning of the brain and what autism has to do with all of this, we need to take a careful look at various aspects of the recently published study. ""Once again I am amazed at how the basic building blocks that make up complex behavior are similar in different organisms and it is truly fascinating how they can be combined with other blocks to create an enormous variety of behavioral reactions in animals and humans,"" said Grigori Enikolopov, the head of MIPT's Laboratory of Brain Stem Cells and corresponding author of the study. This is how the experiment itself was conducted: pairs of male mice were placed in a cage bisected by a partition. The partition allowed the animals to see, hear, and smell each other, but did not allow physical contact. Every day, in the early afternoon, the partition was removed and the observations began: It did not normally take long for fights to break out. After two or three encounters the winner was established and was then (after three minutes, or sometimes less to avoid injuries to the defeated male) separated from its neighbor again. After repeating the process for three days in a row, the scientists changed the mice in the cages, randomly placing defeated males with a new neighbor (but, most importantly, each time a defeated male was placed in the same cage as another winning male). In one group, after three weeks of these rotations, winners were prevented from entering into confrontation, and in another group the mice continued to fight with one another. C57BL male laboratory mice. Credit: Alexei Timoshenko  The scientists also conducted a series of tests to demonstrate the effect of aggression not on the brain, but on behavior. For example, the mice were placed in a cross-shaped maze (plus-maze) where one corridor was closed and the other was an open space. The more time that the mice preferred to spend in the dark, closed space, the more their behavior could be described as ""avoiding risk"". The mice were placed in a cage with a transparent partition and another male on the other side - the more time the mice spent close to the barrier, the higher the level of potential aggression. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that the active animals in the study tend to attack their partners if the opportunity arises (tests were also performed to prove this). All the tests showed that males with winning experience in a number of fights display a more ""brazen"" attitude - they approach the transparent partition more often and initiate an attack on their opponents more quickly. If the mice were deprived of fighting for a period of time before the test, they became even more aggressive:Tthe latency to the first attack was almost three times less, and the fights themselves lasted for longer. But what is particularly interesting is that at the same time their level of anxiety increased. A male who succeeded in tearing out patches of hair from the back of a weaker mouse would rather avoid open spaces, preferring to sit in the dark wherever possible. Read more: Social anxiety is highly heritable but is affected by environment Mice of different lines may even exhibit different behavior when fighting. In a confrontation, C57BL mice normally pull out patches of hair from their opponent's back. The fights are rarely fatal, but cases of this have been known to occur. The methods used in the experiments were not chosen by chance. Natalia Kudryavtseva, one of the authors of the study (Head of the Sector of Social Behaviour Neurogenetics at ICG SB RAS), is an internationally recognized leader in the study of the biological bases of aggression, and the behavioral model and method of studying aggression in mice has been developed over a period of decades. The study of aggression in the context of the function of the brain at the level of individual cells was made possible as a result of the progress achieved in neuroscience in recent decades. Three statements are now considered to be reliably proven: Despite the fact that DNA is the same in all cells, different genes have a different status, and a cell stops the production of unnecessary proteins. By controlling the activity of genes, neurons can also rebuild themselves, and activating stem cells in the brain can lead to the generation of new nerve cells - in order to build the neural networks that play an essential role in memory for example.

Credit:  Smagin et al., Front Neurosci, 2015  Studies in the field of the neurobiology of memory, which were first conducted in the mid-20th century, have shown that learning or even simply encountering something new sets off a series of molecular changes in neurons and certain genes, which scientists call immediate early genes (IEGs), are activated to produce long-term transformations in the brain. If a test sample of an animal's brain is taken shortly after a learning experiment and combined with special labels of the protein encoded by c-fos, scientists are able to observe the changes triggered by the experiment. This is exactly what the authors of the paper did to trace the effects of aggression at cellular level. Monitoring c-fos levels is one of the standard methods of actively searching for changes in nerve cells. In this particular study, the scientists examined the hippocampus and the amygdala. It is often said that the amygdala is associated with emotions, and the hippocampus with memory, and this is generally true but it should be clarified that despite this, memory is not localized in the hippocampus, and to experience emotions even mice need more than just the amygdala. Comparing the activity of the amygdala and the hippocampus enabled scientists to trace the influence of the aggression experiment on two key structures at once. Past evidence suggested that in aggressive and socially active mice, more new neurons are produced in the hippocampus, and in specially bred lines of mice with increased aggressive behavior, the level of neurogenesis is also higher than those who were selected on the basis of reduced aggression. In this experiment, scientists discovered that with repeated fights the level of the c-fos protein increases in the hippocampus, but decreases in the amygdala. And if the mouse is prevented from being involved in further fights, these changes do not occur in the function of immediate early genes, although new neurons still develop. The researchers also conducted a number of additional tests and experiments to interpret the observations made. In relative terms, the effect varied from around ten percent to double the amount of new neurons and for all four lines of mice used in the experiments the effect was statistically significant. This means that it is unlikely to be a coincidence; obtaining such a result exclusively due to the individual differences of the animals has a very low level of probability (no more than a few percent). Learn More: Newborn neurons in the adult brain may help us adapt to the environment The new publication confirms a previous theory: Mice that are accustomed to fighting not only behave differently, but their brain starts to function in a different way. The number of new cells of the hippocampus increases, and if the mice are allowed to continue fighting, the activity of existing cells also changes. New cells seem to be one of the key mechanisms of the increase in aggression and, perhaps, also anxiety, although scientists are not yet certain of this: the winning reputation of an aggressive and dominant mouse would almost certainly need to be backed up by new fights, but this is not something that will help to reduce anxiety. Compared to previous data, the new results are slightly confusing in some areas. It was previously demonstrated that increased anxiety is normally accompanied by a reduction in neurogenesis, but in this case it is the other way around - males with more new neurons in the hippocampus preferred to avoid going out into open, lit areas. It could be that a win produced an effect opposite to the effect of anxiety, it could also be that the researchers have come across a new phenomenon: further tests will be needed to find out the truth. However, the conclusion regarding the activity of cells of the amygdala is interesting not only in the context of fundamental principles of behavior in mice. The scientists note that in humans also the amygdala is involved in a number of pathological processes, including the formation of autism. Increased anxiety, stereotypical repetitive behavior, impaired ability to communicate with others. These symptoms were observed in the mice from the experiments described above and are partially similar to the symptoms of autism. Perhaps this may be a link that will eventually lead to progress not only for scientists, but also for doctors. Moscow Institute of Physics and TechnologySmagin DA et al.

Scientists at the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute have made a key finding of the striking differences in how the brain's cells can change through experience. Their results are published in PLoS One. ""Neurons can undergo long-term changes in response to experience such as learning, emotions, or other activity,"" said Michael Friedlander, executive director of the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute. Friedlander co-authored the paper with his former graduate student and postdoctoral fellow, Ignacio Saez. ""Neuroscientists have focused much of their attention on understanding the neuroplasticity of ... synapses."" See Also: An eye opening look at adult visual plasticity Synapses translate an electrical signal from one neuron into a chemical signal to modify the receiving neuron. The chemical signal triggers an electrical signal in the receiving neuron, and the process continues. Synapses may become stronger or weaker by changing efficiency of the chemical communication process in response to repeated bouts of co-activation of the two interconnected neurons. This process synaptic plasticity can cause changes that persist beyond the co-activation period for mere minutes through a lifetime. Outside experience can be internalized as a physical reorganization of the brain's synaptic communication process. This is especially important during the brain's development but also throughout life as experiences such as learning continually modify the brain's synaptic circuitry. ""Until recently, scientists had thought that most synapses of a similar type and in a similar location in the brain behaved in a similar fashion with respect to how experience induces plasticity,"" Friedlander said. ""In our work, however, we found dramatic differences in the plasticity response, even between neighboring synapses in response to identical activity experiences."" Don't Miss: Synapses: stability in transformation Friedlander and Saez reported that neurons whose excitatory synapses are in a certain states of plasticity, based on previous experiences, assort themselves into groups to converge onto specific individual neurons in the developing brain. ""Individual neurons whose synapses are most likely to strengthen in response to a certain experience are more likely to connect to certain partner neurons, while those whose synapses weaken in response to a similar experience are more likely to connect to other partner neurons,"" Friedlander said. ""The neurons whose synapses do not change at all in response to that same experience are more likely to connect to yet other partner neurons, forming a more stable but non-plastic network."" The researchers observed this like-type synaptic plasticity buddy system in a rodent model, using an isolated part of the cerebral cortex responsible for processing vision. The scientists recorded electrical activity from individual neurons after activating groups of neighboring neurons. They then compared that recording to the electrical activity elicited in response to the activation of only a single neighboring neuron. The synapses were trained by repeating the activation process, to mimic learning. Learn More: First direct evidence for synaptic plasticity in fruit fly brain When the scientists applied a pharmacological agent to the neurons that blocked synaptic inhibition, they saw that training elicited more dramatic and varied plasticity at excitatory synapses. The plasticity responses of different groups of synapses on a given neuron were more similar when inhibition was blocked, which effectively grouped together like-type neurons by their learning responses. ""While we've known for years that neurons of similar types tend to richly interconnect, this is the first demonstration that such assortment processes apply to synaptic plasticity,"" Friedlander said.

Yet, little is known about the brain changes that produce these beneficial health effects. New research from Carnegie Mellon University provides a window into the brain changes that link mindfulness meditation training with health in stressed adults. Published in Biological Psychiatry, the study shows that mindfulness meditation training, compared to relaxation training, reduces Interleukin-6 (IL-6), an inflammatory health biomarker, in high-stress, unemployed community adults. See Also: Meditation might slow the age-related loss of gray matter in the brain The biological health-related benefits occur because mindfulness meditation training fundamentally alters brain network functional connectivity patterns and the brain changes statistically explain the improvements in inflammation.

For the randomized controlled trial, 35 job-seeking, stressed adults were exposed to either an intensive three-day mindfulness meditation retreat program or a well-matched relaxation retreat program that did not have a mindfulness component.

Although previous research has shown that these clumps, called amyloid plaques, are present shortly after a brain injury, this study shows the plaques are still present over a decade after the injury. The findings, by researchers from Imperial College London, may help explain why people who have suffered a serious brain injury appear to be at increased risk of dementia. See Also: Insight into cause of Alzheimer's symptoms: Amyloid plaques may be strangling blood flow Although extensive research now suggests major head injury increases dementia risk in later life, scientists do not know the biological changes that cause this effect.  The consequences of a head injury have been called a hidden disability although patients may seem to have outwardly made a good recovery, when we see them in clinic years later they can have persistent problems which affect their daily life, for example impairments in concentration and memory,  said Dr Gregory Scott, the lead author of the paper, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial.  Research is increasingly showing that a blow to the head, such as that sustained in a road accident, triggers biological processes in the brain that burn away in the background for years,"" added Dr Scott.  Although previous research has shown that some head injury patients have these amyloid plaques shortly after the incident, these findings suggest these plaques are still present in the brains of patients over 10 years later. This helps shed light on why brain injury patients seem to be at increased risk of dementia and may help us develop treatments that reduce this risk.  In the research, published in the journal Neurology, the team studied nine patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries. Many had sustained these in road traffic accidents, such as being hit by a car, between 11 months to 17 years prior to the study. Although they had no physical disabilities from the injury, many still suffered daily problems with memory and concentration. The patients, who were aged between 38-55, underwent a brain scan that used a technique that allows scientists to view amyloid plaques. These proteins are thought to be a hallmark of Alzheimer s disease, and their formation may trigger other changes that lead to the death of brain cells. The team also scanned the brains of healthy volunteers, and people with Alzheimer s disease. The patients with head injury were found to have more amyloid plaques than the healthy volunteers, but fewer than those with Alzheimer s disease. In the head injury patients, the amyloid plaques were found to be centred mainly in two brain areas:  the posterior cingulate cortex   a highly active area in the centre of the brain involved in controlling attention and memory, and the cerebellum - a region at the base of the brain involved in motor control and coordination.

Although this is small-scale study, explained Dr Scott, it provides hope for developing treatments in the future that may help treat the long-term effects of head injuries. ""This is a preliminary study, and it s important to stress that these head injury patients didn t have Alzheimer s disease. However it supports the idea that the window of treatment for brain injury is potentially months or even years after the initial event. If we can find out exactly what processes are going on in the brain, it may be that we can intervene and improve long-term outcomes for patients.

Researchers of a new study published in Biological Psychiatry report successful reduction of depressive symptoms in patients using a novel non-invasive method of vagus nerve stimulation, or VNS. Despite the growing number of medications and neurostimulation approaches available, residual symptoms may be both distressing and disabling. Traditional vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a neurostimulation technique that has been used to alleviate treatment-resistant symptoms of depression. Clinical trials suggested that it produced modest benefit that emerged over long periods of time. However, it was also costly and required risky neurosurgery to implant the vagal nerve stimulators. See Also: Neurostimulation: What is being said in the media and academic literature? In this new study, Drs. Peijing Rong and Jiliang Fang at the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, collaborating with Jian Kong's research team at Harvard Medical School, investigated a new, modified form of VNS called transcutaneous VNS, which instead stimulates the vagus nerve through electrodes clipped onto the ear, similar to how headphones rest inside the ear. Patients with major depressive disorder who volunteered for the study received either transcutaneous VNS or sham (placebo) VNS and underwent a functional neuroimaging scan both before and after one month of treatment. Compared to patients who received sham VNS, the patients who received real VNS showed significant improvement of their depressive symptoms. This improvement was associated with increased functional connectivity between the default mode network and precuneus and orbital prefrontal cortex, an important network in the brain known to be altered in depression. ""The transcutaneous approach may make this treatment for depression more accessible to people with depression, providing it proves to retain the efficacy of the more direct form of vagal nerve stimulation,"" said Dr. John Krystal, Editor of Biological Psychiatry.

CRISPR-Cas9 s popularity continues to grow ever since its first use in genome editing in January, 2013. What makes CRISPR-Cas9 so remarkable is its astonishing efficiency and availability; relatively speaking, it is easy to use. Last year, scientists at the Center for Genome Engineering within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) published a paper in Cell Stem Cell describing how they corrected an inverted gene sequence which effectively cured a type of Hemophilia. The Jin-Soo Kim group at IBS has also used CRISPR-Cas9 to perform a process without using foreign DNA to modify crops. It is such an incredibly useful tool and holds so much potential for the future that it was the focus of the International Summit on Human Gene Editing in Washington DC in December 2015. The future of CRISPR applications is only limited by the imaginations of the scientists using it. CRISPR-Cas9 is an exceptional tool, but the technology isn t perfect. When used, it sometimes produces insertions and deletions, known as indels, at unintended off-target sites. Since unintended gene cleaving could result in an unexpected mutation, it is crucial to detect any errors in the CRISPR-Cas9 process. On January 19th in Genome Research, the Kim team at IBS presented a tool they ve dubbed multiplex Digenome-seq (digested genome sequencing), which can map out genome-wide specificities of several CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases simultaneously to find both intentional and unwanted indels quickly and cheaply. First author Daesik Kim explains that  Digenome-seq differs from other cell-based methods in that it detects DNA cleavages in vitro, rather than in cells, using cell-free genomic DNA.  An advantage of using cell-free DNA is that it produces precise analysis results because chromatin, which is normally found in the cell, doesn t interfere with the process. Also, because the DNA in question doesn t need to be amplified en masse using PCR before investigation; Digenome-seq is easier, faster and cheaper to use than previous methods. Digenome-seq works by combining cell-free target DNA with Cas9 protein and sgRNA (single guide RNA) in vitro. The sgRNA leads the Cas9 to the target and off-target site on the DNA where it gets cleaved by the Cas9 endonuclease. In the study, researchers identified on- and off-target sites cleaved in vitro and measured indel frequencies at hundreds of off-target sites in cells which could potentially become unintended mutations. Their accuracy is then scored using a system the IBS team developed called the OTI (off-target effect index) which compares the ratio of off-target to on-target frequencies. Unlike previously used monoplex processes that can only work with one sgRNA at a time, multiplex Digenome-seq performs simultaneous analysis of numerous sgRNAs to detect all of their on-target and off-target sites simultaneously. This multiplex process is faster, more efficient and more cost effective than previous methods. In addition to its speed, Digenome-seq is able to detect more off-target indels than other methods like HTGTS or Guide-seq. IBS Director Jin-Soo Kim said  CRISPR-Cas9 is an incredible scientific breakthrough and will continue to be the research focus of biologists around the world.  He added that  This technique can be used to choose target sites with the least off-target effects, a method essential for therapeutic applications of CRISPR-Cas9.  With superior accuracy, cost savings and speed, multiplex Digenome-Seq appears to be the new standard for testing CRISPR-Cas9 specificity.","Published: February 5, 2016"

The study may explain how cancer cells corrupt a  quality control  mechanism in tissues that is usually responsible for removing damaged or underperforming cells. Dr Alan Worsley, senior science information officer at Cancer Research UK said the  intriguing  results could help turn healthy cells into a barrier to tumours, but cautioned that further research was needed.  Tumours often need to elbow healthy cells out of the way in order to grow,  he said.  This intriguing study in fruit flies suggests that if researchers can turn off the signals that tell healthy cells to die, they could act as a barrier that boxes cancer cells in and stunts their growth.  We don't yet know if the same thing would work in patients, but it highlights an ingenious new approach that could help to keep early stage cancers in check.  The researchers, based at the Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute at the University of Cambridge, worked with fruit flies which had been genetically engineered to develop tumours in their intestines. They showed for the first time that expanding tumours trigger neighbouring healthy cells into initiating a cellular suicide mechanism called apoptosis. But in flies that were engineered so these surrounding healthy cells were resistant to the trigger, the scientists found they were able to contain the tumour and stop it from spreading. While further research in human cells is still needed, drugs which inhibit cell death are already being trialled in the prevention of organ damage, and if they are proven to be safe they could be tested as a possible way to halt tumour growth. Study leader Dr Eugenia Piddini also believes the team s findings may explain how cancer cells that have spread may trigger damage and failure of these distant organs by killing off healthy residents.  We know that as cancer spreads through the body it can cause organ failure,"" she said. ""Our finding suggests a possible explanation for this: if the tumour kills surrounding cells, there will come a point where there are no longer enough healthy cells for the organ to continue to function.   It sounds counterintuitive not to encourage cell death, as this means you're not attacking the tumour itself,"" she added. ""But if we think of it like an army fighting a titan, it makes sense that if you protect your soldiers and stop them dying, you stand a better chance of containing - and even killing - your enemy.

But somehow Mitra Fabian s iceberg sculpture  B9    made from recycled pipette tips   looks ingenious in a  real world  setting. Mitra Fabian is a sculptor and installation artist who strives to serve a larger purpose when creating her art.  My choice of material is influenced in part by a desire to avoid generating waste,"" she explains. ""I like to recycle materials that would otherwise be destined for the landfill."" Mitra almost exclusively works with manufactured material, the leftovers, the by-products, the remnants of human industry.  Currently residing in the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California, Mitra's choice of pipette tips for the 'B9' sculpture was in part by the large number of biomedical companies in the area. ""They often have surplus or out-of-date stock which they are happy to donate,  Mitra explains.  A pipette tip is a plastic component that attaches the orifice end of a micropipette to accurately aspirate and dispense liquids. The need to transfer specific volumes of liquid in both the laboratory and industrial environments has existed for at least two centuries. The earliest serological and volumetric pipettes were large, long glass devices, capable of aspirating and dispensing relatively large liquid volumes of up to perhaps 100 mL. During the first half of the twentieth century, greater emphasis was placed upon the use of smaller sample and reaction volumes or ""micro-pipetting"" within the laboratory environment, which necessitated the development of considerably smaller and exceedingly more accurate liquid transfer devices. The pipette tip was invented in 1957 with the development of the first micropipette.  The modern pipette tip generally assumes the form of a highly tapered conical structure and is generally molded from polypropylene. The large-bore ""sealing end"" of the tip allows it to be attached to the hand-held pipette, while the much narrower ""orifice end"" employs a narrow aperture to accurately control the flow of liquid into and out of the tip in response to the mechanical action of the pipette. The modern tip is an inexpensive, disposable (consumable) tool, used in a repetitive manner in vast numbers. Pipette tips are often augmented with a porous polyethylene filter to prevent aerosol contamination of the pipette.  So, what was Mitra's esthetic behind 'B9'?  I was looking for some translucent plastics that conduct light in interesting ways. I d used pipette tips in previous projects, but only clear or yellow tips and, when I came across these blue pipette tips, they immediately reminded me of the sea and ice. At the time, there was a lot in the news about icebergs and global warming, and B9 was the result   it s actually named after a real iceberg.  Mitra gives us the scoop on her experience with pipette tips. ""It was, frankly, a complete nightmare putting that piece together! I hadn t realized when I started was that it would be virtually impossible to glue the tips together. I went through around 20 different kinds of colorless, translucent glue hoping to find something that would work, but to no avail. In the end I just had to really jam them together and use friction to hold them in place."" Mitra's experience sounds very similar to those in the lab   the pounding and rocking that can be heard in any lab to jam the tips onto regular pipette shafts! Mitra's artistry is highly respected amongst pipette tip manufacturers like Rainin, a subsidiary of Mettler Toledo, who is committed to finding new ways to further minimize their environmental footprint. Rishi Porecha, Pipette Product Manager at Rainin explains, ""We are committed to producing the highest quality products in the most sustainable and environmentally-sensitive manner available. From production and packaging to marketing and distribution, we are actively applying sustainable technologies and techniques today, and have committed to finding new ways to further minimize our environmental footprint in the future. We are grateful for individuals like Mitra who are able to find alternative solutions to help minimize plastic waste"".  About Mitra FabianMitra Fabian, who was born in Iran and raised in Boston, received a BA in Art with a minor in Anthropology from Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. She later received an MFA from California State University, Northridge. Mirta is currently a professor at West Valley College teaching sculpture and ceramics. Fabian began showing her work nationally in 1997. Her work has been featured in shows at the Museum of Contemporary Craft, the Laguna Art Museum, the Armory Center for the Arts, San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art, Bemis and prominent galleries in Los Angeles and San Francisco.

The original report compiles the findings of research conducted amongst nearly 70 of the United States most influential companies and organisations.  Overall, the US pharma industry and domestic manufacturers are showing increased confidence of renewed growth and even the returning of some lower cost manufacturing work that has, in previous years, been outsourced overseas. This turnaround in the US market s revenue potential is being driven by concerns of quality in some Asian markets and a marked shift in the drug development pipeline towards difficult to formulate drugs and biosimilars. For generics manufacturers, we are seeing a trend towards API sourcing within the United States and near-field manufacturing sites for companies based outside the USA   e.g. Mexico and Canada. The primary reason behind these domestic and near-field sites is an increased regulatory confidence in the standards of manufacturing, due to the proximity of FDA inspectors.  The TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership), TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership)and TPA (Trade Promotion Authority) are surprisingly welcomed by generic manufacturers   despite the potential patent extensions to biosimilars   as the belief is that these partnerships are making domestic generic manufacturers more competitive with their overseas rivals. However, smaller generic firms are likely to be acquired or cease production due to the GDUFA (Generic Drug User Fee Amendment) fees, which companies have to pay at a standard flat rate (irrespective of volumes or role in the supply chain).  For contract manufacturing, the US market is now as hot as it has been at any other time in the last 10-years, with a scramble occurring across international players to get a domestic manufacturing foothold in the market. Moreover, these acquisitions are being driven by the need to acquire specialist technical capabilities and perhaps more significantly, sterile and biologic capabilities. International companies with the dual benefits of development capabilities in the US and generic facilities in lower cost regions look extremely well placed for sizeable future growth.  The future for domestic companies should see them both grow organically due to the favourable conditions, with consolidations occurring among smaller players. But for international companies supplying into the US, we are now at a crucial tipping point, whereby they need to urgently enter the USA market with domestic assets or risk getting left behind.  Manufacturers are also opening new divisions across diagnostics and biomarkers, with the licensing of these tests representing significant new revenue opportunities. Accelerating the US market s manufacturing dominance is a drug pipeline that will see future patented candidates and higher margin generics shifting towards biologics and biosimilars. Regulatory approvals for biologics are by their nature more complicated, so there is also a trend to license biosimilars to existing manufacturing partners. In fact, it is predicted we will see many CDMOs that undertook the development work, maintaining contract services agreements into commercialization, and even, once a product goes generic. The report highlights that small molecules are not dead as profit generators, and that, the  areas in between  such as ADCs and conjugation, particularly for oncology products, are providing new business opportunities with high margins.  The shift in big pharma s R&D pipeline is having a knock-on effect for both manufacturers and contract service providers, who are looking to quickly revaluate their assets and reinvest in smaller more flexible capabilities. With European and US manufacturers now hoovering-up smaller technical and biologics assets. The collective view of the respondents is that the US CMO market, already worth over $10 billion, is predicted to expand significantly faster than the overall pharmaceutical industry, and will be boosted by the outsourcing of non-core businesses, and an increasing amount of specialty and biotechnology companies without in-house capabilities.  The major threat to growth both for manufacturers and contract services providers comes in the form of the impending serialisation deadline. Whilst some companies have began to install compliant capabilities, the general consensus among US manufacturers is that we are still some way behind and the industry needs to quickly begin implementation if it is to stand any chance of being ready in time.   The reported return of API manufacturing to the USA is a massive positive for the regional industry - with costs rising in Asia, the move towards high-value drugs and the risk/cost analysis strongly favouring future US growth. The American market is also now well placed to be a leader in biologics, and with the growth in personalised medicine, biomarkers and combination drugs the domestic manufacturing base seems well suited to capitalise. With this as a background, it is important that international companies without regional facilities, look to secure a foothold in the American market or invest in a prescriptive new business strategy. This is why CPhI and InformEx are so vital to future growth, as they afford both domestic and overseas companies the opportunity to make contacts and establish new working relationships in what is by far the biggest pharma market in the world.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/smallscale-protein-production-a-big-business-for-uw-spinoff-209680,Small Scale Protein Production a Big Business for UW Spinoff  It s only a slight oversimplification to say that making proteins is the entire job of the DNA that comprises our chromosomes  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Proteins form complex structures. They make enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions, form structural components of cells, serve as transporters that move various molecules around inside cells. In the context of biotechnology   where useful proteins are conjured in the lab   a big problem, Fritz Schomburg says, is that proteins misbehave. They fail to form in the fermenter or, more often, fold the wrong way, making them unusable and unsalable. It may take some tweaking, but eventually, Schomburg s firm, Lytic Solutions, figures out how to brew and purify the required quantity of the correctly folded protein, and ships it to his customers. Fritz Schomburg, founder of Lytic Solutions in Madison, with one of the firm s fermenters, where bacteria grow and produce protein for use by pharmaceutical firms or customers in the biomedical industry.  One important group of synthesized proteins   antibodies   is created in nature by the immune system. Science has harnessed lab-made antibodies for use in diagnosis and therapy, and Lytic specializes in making antibodies and the proteins required to purify them. Proteins can take millions of possible configurations, and although Schomburg says making proteins is a  craft,  it s a very 21st century craft, as proteins are at the center of advanced biomedical research and treatment. For example, when antibodies to cancer cells are joined to toxic compounds, the antibodies connect to the tumor and precisely deliver the toxin while sparing healthy cells. According to a 2015 study, the world market for monoclonal (identical) antibodies is expected to grow from $75 billion in 2013 to $125 billion in 2020. In some ways, Lytic is a typical UW-Madison spinoff: Biology and especially biochemistry have spawned a wide range of commercial successes. But unlike many young biotech spinoffs, it earns its income not from federal research grants, but from shipping product. Proteins are extremely difficult and costly to synthesize using chemistry lab techniques, but bacteria that have been genetically altered to do the job in six fermentation vessels that litter Lytic labs in an unprepossessing building on Madison s south side. Growing bacteria to make protein is not quite as simple as dumping yeast (a different type of microbe) into warm, sugary water to make bread. Each fermenter is heavily plumbed with tubing carrying water, sugar or other nutrients. It is hooked up to computers, sensors, controls, pumps and heating or cooling circuits that start the reaction and then siphon off the heat created by the feverish growth of bacteria. Once mature, the bacterial cells must be broken apart before the protein is purified, analyzed, packaged and shipped to the customer in portions ranging from less than a millionth of a gram to a kilogram or so. Finding customers is not difficult for a firm that comes through on its promises, Schomburg says.  Most of our business comes from repeat clients, who understand you are going to do what you told them you would do. If we can t, we thoroughly explain the issues and work with clients to retool the protein to produce an effective replacement for their needs.  Schomburg learned to make proteins while getting a Ph.D. in the lab of UW Madison biochemistry Professor Richard Amasino, which was exploring the genes and proteins that govern the  switch  that causes a plant to start flowering. Then he grew fascinated by art glass. While getting a master of fine arts degree at the UW, he invented combinations of pigments that cause glass to change colors in different light, and embarked on a brief career as a glass sculptor. At home, he grew orchids for shipment around the world   until his landlord had other ideas. Tiring of glass and orchids, Schomburg returned to proteins and started Lytic Solutions, where he works alongside two fellow Ph.D. s, in 2009. Producing protein was a logical career move for someone who likes a challenge, he says.  Every project is new and different, and it can be frustrating, but when something is solved, it s cathartic. If it s too easy, it s boring. If it s too difficult, you will never achieve anything. But if it s hard enough, and still solvable, that s wonderful. ","Published: February 5, 2016"

This experiment was able for the first time to conclusively prove that mitochondria are major triggers of cell ageing. This brings scientists a step closer to developing therapies to counteract the ageing of cells, by targeting mitochondria. Defying ageing in the cell As we grow old, cells in our bodies accumulate different types of damage and have increased inflammation, factors which are thought to contribute to the ageing process.  The team carried out a series of genetic experiments involving human cells grown in the laboratory and succeeded in eliminating the majority, if not all, the mitochondria from ageing cells. Cells can normally eliminate mitochondria which are faulty by a process called mitophagy. The scientists were able to  trick  the cells into inducing this process in a grand scale, until all the mitochondria within the cells were physically removed. To their surprise, they observed that the ageing cells, after losing their mitochondria, showed characteristics similar to younger cells, that is they became rejuvenated. The levels of inflammatory molecules, oxygen free radicals and expression of genes which are among the makers of cellular ageing dropped to the level that would be expected in younger cells. New thinking on mitochondria Dr Jo o Passos of the Institute for Ageing said:  This is a very exciting and surprising discovery. We already had some clues that mitochondria played a role in the ageing of cells, but scientists around the world have struggled to understand exactly how and to what extent these were involved.   These new findings highlight that mitochondria are actually essential to the ageing of cells.  The team led by Newcastle University and involving other universities in the UK and the US, also deciphered a new mechanism by which mitochondria contribute to ageing. They identified that as cells grow old, mitochondrial biogenesis, the complex process by which mitochondria replicate themselves, is a major driver of cellular ageing.   This is the first time that a study demonstrates that mitochondria are necessary for cellular ageing,  said Dr Clara Correia-Melo of the Newcastle University Institute for Ageing and the lead author of the study.  Now we are a step closer to devising therapies which target mitochondria to counteract the ageing of cells. ","Published: February 5, 2016"

Mirvetuximab soravtansine is an experimental ADC for FR -positive cancers that has shown notable activity for FR -positive ovarian cancer in early clinical testing. Mirvetuximab soravtansine contains a monoclonal antibody that enables it to bind to FR -positive tumor cells with ImmunoGen's DM4, a maytansinoid cancer-killing agent, attached to kill these cells. In preclinical research conducted by ImmunoGen and academics, ADCs with maytansinoids have been found to enhance the maturation and activation of the dendritic cells of the immune system that stimulate antitumor responses.1,2 Keytruda is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells.

Approximately 15 other research institutions have formed similar partnerships with the company including Georgetown University s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center in Washington, D.C., the Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania, and several medical centers in Europe enabling a worldwide network for researchers to access the biological specimens.  Collecting and properly preserving human tissue is critically important to cancer research, but it s difficult to fund and requires a specialized set of skills and expertise to build such a program,  said David C. Linehan, M.D., the Seymour I Schwartz Professor and Chair of the URMC Department of Surgery, and director of clinical operations at the Wilmot Cancer Institute. Linehan will be the supervising investigator for the URMC-Indivumed partnership.  Our collaboration allows this to occur in an organized, coordinated way that will benefit all cancer researchers here at Wilmot and the URMC,  Linehan said. Top-quality tissue-banking is an invaluable resource for both cancer treatment and research. When it comes to deciding on cancer treatment, more often doctors are considering a tumor s unique gene characteristics and whether those pathways can be targeted with newer drugs. But in order to run the sophisticated tests that reveal a cancer s precise genomic fingerprint, very high quality tumor specimens and tissue samples must be properly preserved with protocols designed to support genomic analysis. And in cancer research, it s challenging to collect and reproduce meaningful data without a reliable bank of tissue that has been preserved in a consistent way. Importantly, Linehan said, the URMC-Indivumed tissue bank will include information that correlates with patient survival, response to treatment, and whether the tumor was resistant to certain therapies, for example.  This partnership allows us to engage in precision medicine in a much more substantive way,  said Stephen Dewhurst, Ph.D., Vice Dean for Research at the UR School of Medicine and Dentistry.  Indivumed is a world-class operation and is very interested in collaborating with our researchers to drive innovation. By participating in the Indivumed global network, we ll have access to a critical mass of biological samples and clinical data for use in unique clinical trials for our community.  The program starts immediately, and includes collection of many types of cancerous tissues such as pancreatic, colorectal, lung, and breast. Wilmot patients will be asked to consent to having their tissue included in the bank for research purposes.

The results suggest that pharmaceutical compounds or other therapeutic methods that produce elevated levels of TTP in humans may offer an effective treatment for some inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis.  Inflammation has been proven to play a major role in a number of normal processes in humans, but it also fosters diseases, many of which are increasing in prevalence and severity. The development of new therapies for treating inflammatory diseases could greatly reduce the growing health burden. With this goal in mind, Perry Blackshear, M.D., D.Phil., a researcher at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, led the team that genetically altered the TTP gene in mice, so that the animals produced higher than normal amounts of the TTP protein. The mice were then tested using experimental models of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis. Experimental models are used to study processes thought to be involved in human diseases, and to evaluate and select therapies that affect these processes. ""Mice with more TTP in their bodies were resistant to the inflammation that accompanied these experimental models of disease,"" Blackshear said. ""We also found evidence of how TTP is providing this protection."" Blackshear said TTP exerts its beneficial effect by targeting several messenger molecules that encode cytokines, proteins known to be involved in inflammation. TTP binds to these molecules and destabilizes them, resulting in lower levels of cytokines and, thus, decreased inflammation. Blackshear anticipates that TTP-based treatments would be cost effective and easy to administer. Future work will seek to identify compounds that have similar effects on the levels of TTP in the body. ""Many current therapies for these inflammatory diseases are expensive and require the medicines be introduced into the body under the skin, in the muscle, or by intravenous injection,"" said Sonika Patial, D.V.M., Ph.D., a research fellow in Blackshear s research group and lead author on the paper. ""Our ideal treatments would be administered orally in pill or liquid form.""","Published: February 5, 2016"

The compound changed the pH of the tumor environment, from acidic to more alkaline, and kept the cancer from growing. With this work, researchers showed for the first time that they can modulate pH in solid tumors using intentionally designed nanoparticles.   Cancer kills because of metastasis,  said Som, who is working on a doctorate in biomedical engineering in addition to a medical degree.  The pH of a tumor has been heavily correlated with metastasis. For a cancer cell to get out of the extracellular matrix, or the cells around it, one of the methods it uses is a decreased pH.  The researchers set out to find new approaches to raise the pH of the tumor and do so only in the tumor environment. In water, the pH in calcium carbonate increases as high as 9. But when injected into the body, the team discovered that calcium carbonate only raises the pH to 7.4, the normal pH in the human body. However, working with calcium carbonate presented some challenges.  Calcium carbonate doesn t like to be small,  Som said.  Calcium carbonate crystals are normally 10 to 1,000 times bigger than an ideal nanoparticle for cancer therapy. On top of that, calcium carbonate in water will constantly try to grow, like stalactites and stalagmites in a cave.  To solve this issue, Som worked with other researchers in the School of Engineering & Applied Science to create two unique solutions. Teaming up with researchers in the lab of Pratim Biswas, PhD, the Lucy & Stanley Lopata Professor and chair of the Department of Energy, Environmental & Chemical Engineering, they developed a method using polyethyleneglycol-based diffusion to synthesize 20- and 300-nanometer-sized calcium carbonate. Working with Srikanth Singamaneni, PhD, assistant professor of materials science, they developed another method to create 100-nanometer-sized calcium carbonate by building on a method known as ethanol-assisted diffusion. By harnessing the complementary expertise of the different labs, the researchers developed a solvent made of albumin to keep the calcium carbonate nanoparticles from growing, allowing them to be injected into the body intravenously. Commonly, nanoparticles have been made with gold and silver. However, neither are present in the human body, and there are concerns about them accumulating in the body.  Calcium and carbonate are both found heavily in the body, and they are generally non-toxic,  Som said.  When calcium carbonate dissolves, the carbonate becomes carbon dioxide and is released through the lungs, and calcium is often incorporated into the bones.  Som and the team injected the calcium carbonate nanoparticles into the mouse fibrosarcoma model daily, which kept the tumor from growing. However, when they stopped injecting the nanoparticles, it started growing again. Going forward, the researchers plan to determine the optimal dose to prevent metastasis, improve targeting to tumors and determine if it could be used with chemotherapy drugs.","Published: February 5, 2016"

Researchers led by UW Madison chemistry Professor Robert J. Hamers explored the effects of the compound nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC), an emerging material manufactured in the form of nanoparticles that is being rapidly incorporated into lithium ion battery technology, on the common soil and sediment bacterium Shewanella oneidensis.  As far as we know, this is the first study that s looked at the environmental impact of these materials,  says Hamers, who collaborated with the laboratories of University of Minnesota chemist Christy Haynes and UW Madison soil scientist Joel Pedersen to perform the new work. NMC and other mixed metal oxides manufactured at the nanoscale are poised to become the dominant materials used to store energy for portable electronics and electric vehicles. The materials, notes Hamers, are cheap and effective.  Nickel is dirt cheap. It s pretty good at energy storage. It is also toxic. So is cobalt,  Hamers says of the components of the metal compound that, when made in the form of nanoparticles, becomes an efficient cathode material in a battery, and one that recharges much more efficiently than a conventional battery due to its nanoscale properties. Hamers, Haynes and Pedersen tested the effects of NMC on a hardy soil bacterium known for its ability to convert metal ions to nutrients. Ubiquitous in the environment and found worldwide, Shewanella oneidensis, says Haynes, is  particularly relevant for studies of potentially metal-releasing engineered nanomaterials. You can imagine Shewanella both as a toxicity indicator species and as a potential bioremediator.  Subjected to the particles released by degrading NMC, the bacterium exhibited inhibited growth and respiration.  At the nanoscale, NMC dissolves incongruently,  says Haynes, releasing more nickel and cobalt than manganese.  We want to dig into this further and figure out how these ions impact bacterial gene expression, but that work is still underway.  Haynes adds that  it is not reasonable to generalize the results from one bacterial strain to an entire ecosystem, but this may be the first  red flag  that leads us to consider this more broadly.  The big challenge will be keeping old lithium ion batteries out of landfills, where they will ultimately break down and may release their constituent materials into the environment. The group, which conducted the study under the auspices of the National Science Foundation-funded Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology at UW Madison, also plans to study the effects of NMC on higher organisms. According to Hamers, the big challenge will be keeping old lithium ion batteries out of landfills, where they will ultimately break down and may release their constituent materials into the environment.  There is a really good national infrastructure for recycling lead batteries,  he says.  However, as we move toward these cheaper materials there is no longer a strong economic force for recycling. But even if the economic drivers are such that you can use these new engineered materials, the idea is to keep them out of the landfills. There is going to be 75 to 80 pounds of these mixed metal oxides in the cathodes of an electric vehicle.  Hamers argues that there are ways for industry to minimize the potential environmental effects of useful materials such as coatings,  the M&M strategy,  but the ultimate goal is to design new environmentally benign materials that are just as technologically effective.","Published: February 5, 2016"

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genetic-cause-of-rare-allergy-195742,Genetic Cause of Rare Allergy Institute has identified a genetic mutation responsible for a rare form of inherited hives induced by vibratory urticaria  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Running, hand clapping, towel drying or even taking a bumpy bus ride can cause temporary skin rashes in people with this rare disorder. By studying affected families, researchers discovered how vibration promotes the release of inflammatory chemicals from the immune system's mast cells, causing hives and other allergic symptoms. Their findings, published online in the New England Journal of Medicine on Feb. 3, suggest that people with this form of vibratory urticaria experience an exaggerated version of a normal cellular response to vibration. The study was led by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both part of NIH. ""Investigating rare disorders such as vibratory urticaria can yield important insights into how the immune system functions and how it reacts to certain triggers to produce allergy symptoms, which can range from mild to debilitating,"" said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. ""The findings from this study uncover intriguing new facets of mast cell biology, adding to our knowledge of how allergic responses occur."" ""This study illustrates the power of a multidisciplinary team, involving clinicians, geneticists and basic immunologists, to get to the heart of a medical mystery,"" said Dan Kastner, M.D., Ph.D., scientific director of the Intramural Research Program at NHGRI and a co-author of the study. ""It also underscores the tremendous potential of new genomic techniques."" In addition to itchy red welts at the site of vibration on the skin, people with vibratory urticaria also sometimes experience flushing, headaches, fatigue, blurry vision or a metallic taste in the mouth. Symptoms usually disappear within an hour, but those affected may experience several episodes per day. Mast cells, which reside in the skin and other tissues, release histamine and other inflammatory chemicals into the bloodstream and surrounding tissue in response to certain stimuli, a process known as degranulation. To assess potential mast cell involvement in vibratory urticaria, the researchers measured blood levels of histamine during an episode of vibration-induced hives. Histamine levels rose rapidly in response to vibration and subsided after about an hour, indicating that mast cells had released their contents. The researchers also observed increased tryptase, another marker of mast cell degranulation, in skin around the affected area. ""Notably, we also observed a small increase in blood histamine levels and a slight release of tryptase from mast cells in the skin of unaffected individuals exposed to vibration,"" said Hirsh Komarow, M.D., of NIAID's Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, the senior author of the study. ""This suggests that a normal response to vibration, which does not cause symptoms in most people, is exaggerated in our patients with this inherited form of vibratory urticaria."" The NIH team realized that the first family's symptoms matched those of a different family described by researchers at Yale University in 1981. Through a collaboration with Yale, the NIH team obtained DNA samples from 25 members of that family. Two family members came to NIH for evaluation, and they put the scientists in contact with a third family with similar symptoms. To identify the genetic basis of the disorder, the scientists performed genetic analyses, including DNA sequencing, on 36 affected and unaffected members from the three families. They found a single mutation in the ADGRE2 gene shared by family members with vibratory urticaria but not present in unaffected people. The scientists did not detect the ADGRE2 mutation in variant databases or in the DNA of more than 1,000 unaffected individuals with a similar genetic ancestry as the three families. ""This work marks, to the best of our knowledge, the first identification of a genetic basis for a mast-cell-mediated urticaria induced by a mechanical stimulus,"" said Dean Metcalfe, M.D., chief of NIAID's Laboratory of Allergic Diseases and a study co-author. The ADGRE2 gene provides instructions for production of ADGRE2 protein, which is present on the surface of several types of immune cells, including mast cells. ADGRE2 is composed of two subunits -- a beta subunit located within the cell's outer membrane, and an alpha subunit located on the outside surface of the cell. Normally, these two subunits interact, staying close together. People with familial vibratory urticaria produce a mutated ADGRE2 protein in which this subunit interaction is less stable, the investigators found. After vibration, the alpha subunit of the mutant protein was no longer in close contact with the beta subunit. When the alpha subunit detaches from the beta subunit, the researchers suggest, the beta subunit produces signals inside mast cells that lead to degranulation, which causes hives and other allergy symptoms. The research suggests that the ADGRE2 subunit interaction plays a key role in the mast cell response to certain physical stimuli, which could have implications for other diseases in which mast cells are involved. Next, the scientists plan to study what happens to the alpha subunit post-vibration and to unravel the cellular signaling leading to degranulation. They also plan to recruit more families with vibratory urticaria to further study the disorder and look for additional mutations in ADGRE2 and other genes. NIAID conducts and supports research at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses.","Published: February 5, 2016"

Together, the two companies will evaluate the combination to treat serious infections caused by metallo  lactamase MBL-producing Gram-negative pathogens, a difficult-to-treat sub-type of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), for which there are currently very limited treatments, thus presenting a new treatment option for patients with MBL-producing pathogens. Under the terms of the agreement, Allergan will maintain commercialization rights in the U.S. and Canada and AstraZeneca will maintain commercialization rights in all other countries. ATM-AVI is the first drug candidate to be developed under a public-private partnership agreement between AstraZeneca and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). Announced in September 2015, the goal of this strategic alliance is to develop a portfolio of drug candidates over the next five years with dual uses in treating illnesses caused by bioterrorism agents and antibiotic-resistant infections. ""The rate of antibiotic resistance continues to increase worldwide, representing a truly global threat that requires collaboration and sustained commitment from industry and government to develop solutions,"" said David Nicholson, Executive Vice President, Global Brands Research and Development, Allergan. Nicholson continued, ""As a leader in anti-infectives, we are dedicated to the ongoing research and development of innovative products, like ATM-AVI, for patients with difficult-to-treat infections who, today, have very few or no effective options."" Aztreonam is not inactivated by MBLs, as a single agent it has limited utility because the vast majority of MBL-producing pathogens also express serine- -lactamases that can inactivate it. With avibactam's ability to inhibit many serine- -lactamase enzymes, aztreonam's activity is restored against pathogens that co-produce MBLs and serine enzymes, thus presenting a new treatment option for patients.

The mathematical model, developed by researchers from the University of Cambridge, is the first biologically realistic account of the process, and is able to predict not only behavior, but also neural activity. The results, reported in The Journal of Neuroscience, could aid in the understanding of conditions from obsessive compulsive disorder and addiction to Parkinson's disease. See Also: The role of dopaminergic neurons in decision making The model was compared to experimental data for a wide-ranging set of tasks, from simple binary choices to multistep sequential decision making. It accurately captures behavioral choice probabilities and predicts choice reversal in an experiment, a hallmark of complex decision making. Our decisions may provide immediate gratification, but they can also have far-reaching consequences, which in turn depend on several other actions we have already made or will make in the future. The trouble that most of us have is how to take the potential long-term effects of a particular decision into account, so that we make the best choice. There are two main types of decisions: habit-based and goal-based. An example of a habit-based decision would be a daily commute, which is generally the same every day. Just as certain websites are cached on a computer so that they load faster the next time they are visited, habits are formed by 'caching' certain behaviors so that they become virtually automatic. An example of a goal-based decision would be a traffic accident or road closure on that same commute, forcing the adoption of a different route. ""A goal-based decision is much more complicated from a neurological point of view, because there are so many more variables - it involves exploring a branching set of possible future situations,"" said the paper's first author Dr Johannes Friedrich of Columbia University, who conducted the work while a postdoctoral researcher in Cambridge's Department of Engineering. ""If you think about a detour on your daily commute, you need to make a separate decision each time you reach an intersection."" Habit-based decisions have been thoroughly studied by neuroscientists and are fairly well-understood in terms of how they work at a neural level. The mechanisms behind goal-based decisions however, remain elusive. Now, Friedrich and Dr M t  Lengyel, also from Cambridge's Department of Engineering, have built a biologically realistic solution to this computational problem. The researchers have shown mathematically how a network of neurons, when connected appropriately, can identify the best decision in a given situation and its future cumulative reward. ""Constructing these sorts of models is difficult because the model has to plan for all possible decisions at any given point in the process, and computations have to be performed in a biologically plausible manner,"" said Friedrich. ""But it's an important part of figuring out how the brain works, since the ability to make decisions is such a core competence for both humans and animals."" Learn More: How various brain areas interact in decisions The researchers also found that for making a goal-based decision, the synapses which connect the neurons together need to 'embed' the knowledge of how situations follow on from each other, depending on the actions that are chosen, and how they result in immediate reward. Crucially, they were also able to show in the same model how synapses can adapt and re-shape themselves depending on what did or didn't work previously, in the same way that it has been observed in human and animal subjects. ""By combining planning and learning into one coherent model, we've made what is probably the most comprehensive model of complex decision-making to date,"" said Friedrich. ""What I also find exciting is that figuring out how the brain may be doing it has already suggested us new algorithms that could be used in computers to solve similar tasks,"" added Lengyel. The model could be used to aid in the understanding of a range of conditions. For instance, there is evidence for selective impairment in goal-directed behavioral control in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder, which forces them to rely instead on habits. Deep understanding of the underlying neural processes is important as impaired decision making has also been linked to suicide attempts, addiction and Parkinson's disease.

Their contributions include a large proportion of our peripheral nerves, the melanocytes that provide skin color and protection from damaging UV light, as well as many different cell types in our face, including muscle, bone, cartilage and tooth-forming cells. See Also: Stem cells from teeth can make brain-like cells The proper functioning of these cells is critical for human development and health. When neural crest biology fails, various birth defects and illnesses cleft lip/palate, Hirschsprung and Waardenburg syndromes, melanoma and neuroblastoma result.  A better study of these cells is crucial, therefore, to aid in clinical efforts to diagnose and treat such conditions. But access to these embryonic cells in humans is very difficult. As an alternative, scientists turned to models based in embryonic stem cells. While protocols to generate human neural crest cells from human embryonic stem cells have progressed since the first report 11 years ago, they still have considerable limitations for their use in basic and clinical research. This is because these protocols commonly use ingredients or components not well defined, such as blood serum which contains many unknown components of varying concentrations.  Some protocols result in large clusters of cells, impairing the identification of specific molecules and their roles during neural crest cell formation.  Furthermore, the fastest of these protocols takes 12 days (of very costly culture conditions) to convert human embryonic stem cells to neural crest cells.  Oftentimes the protocols provide low yields, making the isolation of the desired neural crest cells a time-consuming and technically challenging process. Work done by a research team led by an associate professor of biomedical sciences in the School of Medicine at the University of California (UC), Riverside now addresses these problems by providing a robust, fast, simple and trackable method to generate neural crest cells.  The proposed method can facilitate research in basic sciences and clinical applications alike.  Our study provides a superb model to generate neural crest cells in just five days starting from human embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent cells, using a simple and well-defined media with all ingredients known and accounted for,  said Mart n I. Garc a-Castro, whose lab led the study published in the journal Development.  Our cost-effective, efficient and fast protocol allows a better analysis of the relevant signals and molecules involved in the formation of these cells.  Our results suggest that human neural crest cells can arise independently from and prior to the formation of mesoderm and neural ectoderm derivatives, both of which had been thought to be critical for neural crest formation.  The mesoderm is the middle layer of the embryo in early development.  It lies between the endoderm and the ectoderm, the latter being the outermost layer.  Garc a-Castro s previous work on birds already challenged the dogma suggesting that neural crest cells form without mesodermal or neural contribution.  Unpublished results from his lab have also confirmed the same using rabbit embryos as a mammalian model. Learn More: Scientists engineer toxin-secreting stem cells to treat brain tumors With regard to identifying specific molecules and their roles during neural crest cell formation, Garc a-Castro s new work demonstrates the critical role played by a molecule known as WNT and highlights contributions from protein families called FGFs and BMPs. Briefly, WNT proteins are signaling molecules that regulate cell-to-cell interactions during development and adult tissue homeostasis. The FGF protein family controls a wide range of biological functions.  BMPs induce the formation of bone and cartilage and form tissues throughout the body.  Our work provides strong evidence of the critical and initiating role of WNT signals in neural crest cell formation, with later contributions by FGF and BMP pathways,  he said. Garc a-Castro emphasized that the proper function of neural crest cells is essential for human development and health.  The study of these cells is essential to improve clinical efforts to diagnose, manage, and perhaps prevent diseases and conditions linked to them, and our lab has already launched efforts towards facial clefts   lip and or palate   and melanoma, and we hope to make substantial progress in both areas thanks to this novel protocol,  he said.

This deprivation results in hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), which can lead to long-term neurological issues such as learning disabilities, cerebral palsy or even death. Researchers have known for some time that male infants are more vulnerable to HIE than females, but why this gender difference exists has remained a mystery. See Also: How do neural cells respond to ischemia? In a study published in the journal eNeuro, researchers at the Waisman Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, led by Pelin Cengiz, associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics, show that a particular protein found in the brains of both male and female mice is present at higher levels in females, which offers them stronger protection against this type of brain injury. ""People often think that biological sex differences start to arise only after puberty, but they actually start in the womb and persist until the tomb,"" says Cengiz, paraphrasing a 1999 statement by the Institute of Medicine. ""So, treatment approaches that may work for newborn boys may not work for girls, and vice versa. We need to get it right to develop effective therapies."" The protein is called estrogen receptor  , or ER  for short, and the researchers set out to learn how it confers its gender-specific protective effects. Their first clue lay with a particular drug known to protect female but not male newborn mice from the effects of brain injury caused by HIE. The drug works by turning on a cascade of protective effects in the brain in response to oxygen deprivation and reduced blood flow. The team learned that, like the drug, ER  also causes a similar cascade in infant mice and the protein is actually required for the drug to be effective. The researchers found that female mice lacking the ER  protein could not activate protective factors following HIE, even when treated with the drug. When the researchers studied the brains of male and female mice that could make the ER  protein, they learned that levels of this protective protein were significantly higher in female compared to male brains following oxygen deprivation and reduced blood flow. ""Under normal circumstances the brains of male and female mice have similar amounts of ER ,"" says Cengiz, who is now exploring why ER  levels increase in female but not male brains after HIE. Learn More: Scientists catch brain damage in the act Understanding the mechanism of how female brains are more resistant to damage from oxygen deprivation and reduced blood flow is a first step toward helping newborns of both sexes recover after suffering from HIE and live functional lives. It could also lead to more effective therapies and treatments for both genders, Cengiz says. But more work needs to be done. For one thing, Cengiz and her colleagues looked at only the hippocampus region of the brain, which is linked to memory and learning and is involved in other neurological roles. The hippocampus is also a site where new neurons are continually generated throughout the lifespan. ""We focused on the hippocampus because we see memory and learning disabilities in many of the children affected by HIE,"" says Cengiz, ""and it is also the part of the brain that is most often injured after HIE."" While it could be years before human babies benefit, each molecular mystery researchers unravel provides a potential new road to developing new therapies, Cengiz says, noting: ""We are driven by the desire to improve outcomes for all newborns who suffer brain injury from HIE.""

""We knew that the compaction into chromatin makes genes inaccessible to the cellular machinery necessary for gene expression, and we also knew that enzymes opened up the chromatin to specify which genes were accessible and could be expressed in a cell, but until now, we didn't know the mechanism by which these enzymes functioned,"" said B. Franklin Pugh, Evan Pugh Professor, Willaman Chair in Molecular Biology, and professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Penn State University and one of the two corresponding authors of the paper along with Matthieu G rard of the University of Paris-Sud in France. The discovery was achieved by an international collaboration of scientists from the Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission in France (Commissariat   l' nergie atomique et aux  nergies alternatives), the National Center for Scientific Research in France (Centre national de la recherche scientifique), the University of Paris-Sud in France, Southern Medical University in Guangzhou in China, and Penn State University in the United States. The researchers first mapped the location of several ""chromatin-remodeller enzymes"" across the entire genome of the embryonic stem cells of the mouse. The mapping showed that remodeller enzymes bind to particular nucleosome  beads  at the sites along the wrapped-up DNA that are located just before the gene sequence begins.  These sites are important because they are the location where the process of expressing genes begins - - where other proteins required for gene expression team up for the process of turning a gene on. The researchers then tested how the chromatin-remodeller enzymes impact gene expression by reducing the amount of each of these enzymes in embryonic stem cells. The scientists found that some chromatin-remodeller enzymes promote gene expression, some repress gene expression, and some can do both. ""The correct expression of genes is necessary to define the identity and function of different types of cells in the course of embryonic development and adult life,"" said Pugh. ""Chromatin-remodeller enzymes help each cell type accurately express the proper set of genes by allowing or blocking access to the critical section of DNA at the beginning of genes.""","Published: February 4, 2016"

Aged and damaged cells frequently undergo a form of proliferation arrest called cellular senescence. These fading cells increase in human tissues with aging and are thought to contribute to age-related increases in both cancer and inflammation. The secretion of such inflammatory compounds as cytokines, growth factors, and proteases is called the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, or SASP. In a study,  genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme, called MLL1, in both human cells and mice prevents the deleterious activation of the DNA damage response, which causes SASP expression.  Since tumor-promoting inflammation is one of the hallmarks of cancer, these findings suggest that MLL1 inhibitors may be highly potent anti-cancer drugs through both direct epigenetic effects on proliferation-promoting genes, as well as through the inhibition of inflammation in the tumor microenvironment,  says first author Brian Capell, MD, PhD, a medical fellow in the lab of Shelley Berger, PhD, the Daniel S. Och University Professor in the Departments of Cell & Developmental Biology, Genetics , and Biology. Berger is also the director of the Penn Epigenetics Program. Capell is an instructor and attending physician in the Department of Dermatology and is a postdoctoral fellow in the Berger lab. The mechanism of this inhibition is through the direct epigenetic regulation by MLL1 of critical proliferation-promoting cell cycle genes that are required for triggering the DNA damage response in the body. MLL1 is an enzyme that adds methyl groups to loosen chromatin, the proteins around which DNA winds, so that part of the genome can be  read  and translated into proteins   its epigenetic role. However, MLL1 is also commonly mutated in numerous human cancers, particularly in pediatric and adult blood cancers.  We show that MLL1 inhibition blocks the expression of inflammatory genes in both senescent and cancerous human cells, including those derived from human breast cancer  Capell said. Knowing that MLL1 has been implicated in cell-cycle regulation, when the researchers inhibited MLL1, proliferation-promoting genes were shut down and the DNA damage response and resulting inflammation was suppressed. Indeed, in the case of applying this result to fighting cancer, this is a desired effect, since an increase in inflammation can promote both the development and progression of cancer.  In cancer, this could be a potent one-two punch, by blocking both proliferation-promoting genes as well as the cancerous inflammation,  Capell explained.  One could imagine taking an MLL1 inhibitor as a primary treatment, but also as an adjuvant therapy to tamp down the rampant inflammation caused by drugs like chemotherapies. More speculatively, given that the SASP has been implicated in numerous other age-related disorders, it will be worth testing the effects of MLL1 inhibition in other aging and inflammatory disease models.

The team hopes the discovery will lead to better methods for diagnosing and treating these cancers, which cannot always be cured with surgery.  Treating pediatric brain cancer patients with the wrong chemotherapy can cause lasting harm, and this finding should enable us to avoid that in many cases through a more accurate diagnosis,  said study co-leader Adam C. Resnick, PhD, an assistant professor of Neurosurgery at Penn Medicine. He expects that the finding also will lead to discoveries of similar tumor-driving mechanisms in other forms of cancers in both children and adults. The study emerged from a multi-center collaborative effort led by Penn, CHOP, and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. The broad aim of the collaboration has been to gain a more detailed understanding of the genomic abnormalities underlying the most common childhood brain cancers, known as pediatric low-grade gliomas. Researchers already know that certain sub-types of these gliomas are driven mostly by mutations or duplications to genes in the growth-related, mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Drugs that block MAPK signaling are beginning to be investigated in clinical trials with pediatric patients. In this study, however, Resnick and his colleagues sought to characterize abnormalities in pediatric gliomas sub-types that are not driven by MAPK-pathway mutations. With dozens of laboratories collaborating in the study, the team was able to put together the largest-ever genomic dataset from these rare tumors, comprising 249 cases. They found that besides MAPK-related alterations the most common genetic abnormalities were those involving a growth-driving gene, MYB, which normally is active only during the fetal phase of life. The MYB alterations were especially frequent in one particularly rare pediatric glioma subtype, angiocentric glioma. In fact, all of the 19 angiocentric glioma samples had detectable MYB alterations, and there was evidence that most of these alterations involved one specific abnormality: a deletion of chromosomal DNA that left one end of MYB fused to a normally separate gene, QKI. Investigating further, the team found that the MYB-QKI gene fusions appeared to be driving these brain tumors in three different ways. First, although MYB is normally not expressed in the developed human brain, the gene arrangement in angiocentric gliomas leads to abnormal expression and transcriptional activity of MYB via the MYB-QKIgene fusion and indeed the fused MYB-QKI works as an oncogene to drive tumor formation. Second, the fusion deletes enough of QKI to disrupt its chief function, which appears to be tumor suppression, thus QKI fails to exert its usual braking effect when the rate of cell division becomes aberrant. The third, most new and interesting mechanism turned out to involve a combination of elements from the two genes.  We found that the fusion event brings QKI-related enhancer elements close enough to MYB s promoter region to activate it, thereby driving MYB-QKI expression,  said Payal Jain, a PhD student in the Cell and Molecular Biology program at Penn and working in Resnick s laboratory. In addition, MYB-QKI can drive its own expression, propelling a positive feedback loop in these tumors. Taking all of this together, a cell attempting to protect itself from excessive growth by dialing up QKI s usual growth-slowing activity would instead boost the expression of the fused MYB-QKI with its overall growth-promoting activity. Experiments in mice confirmed that the MYB-QKI fusion in injected test cells is sufficient to create tumors. In the short term, the findings should enable physicians to identify pediatric gliomas that contain these mutations, thus sparing some children MAPK-targeted therapy that may not work. The discovery also suggests strategies for future new therapies for example, blocking the epigenetic dysregulation that helps drive MYB-QKI activity. Such therapies may end up being applicable to a much wider range of cancers.  Gene fusions are common in cancers, and we think it s likely that some will be found to work via combinatorial mechanisms like those we ve uncovered in this study,  Resnick said. Jain, Resnick, and their colleagues will follow up with investigations of other gene fusions and abnormalities found in pediatric gliomas in the hope that specific treatments can be developed for all subtypes of these cancers.  Pediatric brain tumors are rare, so it s only through large collaborations like this one that we can bring together enough samples and data to do such meaningful studies,  Resnick said. Collaborating with Resnick on the project was Phillip Storm, MD, an associate professor of Neurosurgery and Neurosurgery division chief at CHOP.

Foetuses produce small amounts of bile acids on their own, but here we are talking about much larger quantities. The bile acid appears to be produced by the mother and then transferred to the foetus via the placenta , says senior author to recently released article Kenichi Miharada. A large part of bile acid is in fact toxic for cells, but undergoes a purification process when transferred through the placenta, letting only harmless bile acid through to the foetus. It has been known that bile acid is produced in the foetal liver, but not why. Kenichi Miharada discovered that bile acid supports the production of blood stem cells in the foetal liver, and enables them to develop normally. The additional contribution from the mother is important for the foetus to develop normally.  Our hypothesis is that the consequence of a damaged placenta, which for various reasons is unable to transfer bile acids to the foetus, can lead to leukaemia or other blood diseases later in life, and we will continue our research to see if this hypothesis holds up , says Kenichi Miharada. Researchers have not yet managed to get the blood-forming stem cells to produce new stem and blood cells in a laboratory. The problem with making blood stem cells proliferate outside the body is that the artificial growth gives rise to an accumulation of abnormal proteins in a part of the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum, ER. Among other things, this so-called ER stress, if the stress is severe and chronic, cause cell death. Researcher Kenichi Miharada has previously shown that it is possible to reduce ER stress chemically by adding bile acids to the cell culture. Bile acids, which are produced naturally in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, support the protein production during the cell division process.  Compared to other ways of trying to develop stem cells to treat blood diseases, this method is safer and quicker, because it does not involve using any artificial substances or any genetic modifications, merely a substance that already exists inside the body , he explains.","Published: February 4, 2016"

It s a significant one, because up until now, crystals have grown in rigid, structured formations. One of the forms we re most familiar with is the snowflake, with a web of straight lines connecting to making a grid that grows into the crystalline flake. Crystals form this way because their molecules are predisposed to align themselves in a way that links them via the strongest electrochemical bond available. If molecules are floating freely, as they are in a water vapor for example, they are able to follow this default course to connect with other molecules and, eventually, form a crystal   an ice crystal, or snowflake, in the case of water molecules. But, as the adage holds: no two snowflakes are alike. This is because the formation of a crystal can be affected by the environment in which it forms. Li uses this molecular property to engineer his hollow crystal spheres. His  crystalsomes  are named for their similarity to liposomes   tiny bubbles with the same membrane as cells that are being explored for use as biological packages for delivering drug treatments. But Li and his team estimate that their crystalsomes could actually be better at making the delivery than their namesake, because crystals hold up a bit better than liposomes both on the way into and within the body.  Mechanical properties of polymeric materials could be improved by forming crystalline structures,  Li said.  While precisely tuning crystallization within a nanoscale curved space is challenging, we envisage that this novel structure could shed light on investigating spherical crystallography and drug delivery.  Li was able to overcome crystal s edge-forming tendencies by containing it inside a droplet. A rough equivalent of this would be forcing a single snowflake to form inside a tiny snow globe, rather than in the open expanse of the atmosphere. For his nanoscopic version of the snow globe, Li employed a little trick that you might recognize if you ve ever tried to make vinaigrette. He created a tiny bubble of oil to encase water molecules. When the surfactant bubble was cooled to the appropriate temperature, the molecules inside began to crystalize. But rather than forming an angular web of connections, the molecules, instead, lined up along the interior of the oil bubble   crystallizing in a hollow, spherical shape. Early tests indicate that the crystalsome is a few hundred times stronger than liposomes, which makes them a sturdier option for medicine encapsulation. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Li s team is now exploring ways to control the shape and strength of the spheres by making them out of different molecules.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genetic-mechanism-behind-cancercausing-mutations-195786,Genetic Mechanism Behind Cancer Causing Mutations Researchers at Indiana University has identified a genetic mechanism that is likely to drive mutations that can lead to cancer  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.The study finds the enzyme APOBEC3G -- a known trigger for mutations that occur as benign tumor cells transform into cancerous malignancies that spread throughout the body -- appears to cause these harmful changes by mutating genes during the replication of DNA. The research, conducted in the bacteria Escherichia coli, was supported in part by IU's $6.2 million grant to investigate bacterial evolution from the U.S. Army Research Office. Patricia Foster, the principal investigator on the grant and a professor in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences  Department of Biology, is senior author on the study. The study also received support from the Wayne State University School of Medicine, whose researchers provided expertise on APOBEC3G and helped analyze the data. All experiments were carried out at IU. ""Many tumors accumulate mutations during their growth, which leads to the subsequent characteristics that permit metastasis,"" Foster said. ""Based upon the results revealed in bacteria in our study, we believe that the APOBEC family of enzymes create some of these mutations specifically during the rapid growth of these tumors."" The results could have implications for personalized medicine, a growing movement to tailor treatments and therapies based upon individualized genetic information. For example, since it is possible to identify tumors potentially vulnerable to the enzyme by using current DNA sequencing technology, a physician treating these tumors might want to explore temporarily suppressing expression of this enzyme, she said. An important organism for studying genes, E. coli allows scientists to observe genetic changes over thousands of generations in a relatively short time span. The results apply to humans as well as bacteria since the basic mechanisms of DNA replication are the same across all species. Normally, the APOBEC family of enzymes plays an important role in the human immune system by driving changes in immune cells that aid in defense against viruses, possibly including the HIV/AIDS virus. But IU scientists found the harmful influence of the enzyme family arises from the complex way that two halves of every double-stranded DNA molecule must unravel to replicate during cellular division -- splitting into two temporarily single-stranded DNA chains thousands of ""links"" in length to serve as templates for the new copy. These links are the four chemicals, or nucleobases, that comprise all DNA: cytosine, or C; guanine, or G; adenine, or A; and thymine, or T. As these paired chemicals are split in half to be copied, one of the two single-stranded bits of DNA -- known as the lagging strand template -- is highly vulnerable to genetic mutation, Foster said. This ""gap in the armor"" occurs because the enzyme that builds a new string of DNA -- known as a DNA polymerase -- must repeatedly traverse the nucleobases in the lagging strand template thousands of times during the course of replication, stopping further down the chain from the base pair previously inserted on the past loop along the chemical chain. Each of these polymerase ""hops"" creates a long stretch of DNA that temporarily remains as a single strand. The complex process -- driven by the fact that the two DNA strands are oriented in opposite directions and polymerases copy in only a single direction -- introduces more opportunities for errors in the lagging strand template compared to the continuous, step-by-step process that replicates the other half of the split strand of DNA, called the leading strand template. ""We're talking about thousands of bases exposed without a complimentary strand throughout the whole replication cycle,"" Foster said. ""If I were going to design an organism, I would make two types of copying enzymes, one that could go each way. But that s not how it works; no organism has ever evolved a more efficient way to replicate DNA."" The mechanism by which the APOBEC family of enzymes drives mutation is cytosine deamination, in which a cytosine -- the ""C"" nucleobase -- transforms into uracil, one of the four bases in RNA that doesn t play a role in DNA replication. But the presence of uracil during DNA replication can cause an error when a thymine -- the ""T"" nucleobase -- replaces a cytosine. APOBEC enzymes specifically target the C's in single-stranded DNA for deamination. The disruptive effect of the enzyme on genetic replication in the study was observed in a strain of E. coli whose ability to remove the dangerous uracils had been switched off. To conduct the experiment, Foster s lab observed the effect of APOBEC3G on approximately 50 identical lineages of E. coli over the course of nearly 100 days, with each day encompassing 20 to 30 bacterial generations. Over time, a unique pattern of nucleotides was detected in the mutated DNA, a chain of three cytosine molecules, or C-C-C, the same genetic signature found in other studies of the enzyme family. And these mutations were four times more likely to be found on the lagging-strand template than on the leading-strand template. ""These results strongly suggest that these mutations occur as APOBEC3G attacks cytosines during DNA replication, while they're most exposed on the lagging strand template,"" Foster said. ""This basic mechanism appears to be the same in bacteria and in human tumors cells.""","Published: February 4, 2016"

The cryo-EM images also helped the researchers establish, at atomic resolution, the sequence of structural changes that normally occur in the protein, p97, an enzyme critical for protein regulation that is thought to be a novel anti-cancer target. The study appeared online January 28, 2016, in Science. Sriram Subramaniam, Ph.D., of the National Cancer Institute s (NCI) Center for Cancer Research, led the research. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.  Cryo-EM is positioned to become an even more useful tool in structural biology and cancer drug development,  said Douglas Lowy, M.D., acting director, NCI.  This latest finding provides a tantalizing possibility for advancing effective drug development.  To determine structures by cryo-EM, protein suspensions are flash-frozen at very low temperatures; nevertheless, the water around the protein molecules stays liquid-like. The suspensions are then bombarded with electrons to capture their images. To produce three-dimensional protein structures using cryo-EM, researchers generate thousands of two-dimensional images of the molecules in different orientations, which are then averaged together. This type of imaging procedure has gained in popularity in structural biology research because it allows for the observation of specimens that have not been stained or fixed in any way, enabling visualization of the specimens under near-native, or natural, conditions. Earlier structural studies of full-length p97 by a well-established technique known as X-ray crystallography have been limited so far to medium resolution (3.5   to 4.7  ). With cryo-EM, however, researchers were able to image full-length p97 at an overall resolution of 2.3  , which is much finer, allowing them to visualize key regions of the protein in atomic detail. Most significantly, the mode of binding and contact sites of a small molecule inhibitor of p97 activity could be observed directly. Drug development efforts often involve mapping the contacts between small molecules and their binding sites on specific proteins. With this latest finding, the resolutions achieved were significant enough to discern both the shape of the protein chain and some of the hydrogen bonds between the protein and the small molecule inhibitor.  Our latest research provides new insights into the protein structures and interactions that are critical for the activity of a cancer cell, and this knowledge will hopefully enable the design of clinically useful drugs,  said Subramaniam. Subramaniam and colleagues recently used cryo-EM to understand the functioning of a variety of molecules, including proteins and receptors found in brain cells. The level of detail achieved in their new study however, resolutions of 2.3   and 2.4   for p97 with and without the bound inhibitor, are second only the 2.2   resolution structure reported last year in Science for an enzyme, also by the same group of NCI researchers.","Published: February 4, 2016"

Some of the people had long-term memory difficulties, others working-memory issues. With long-term memory difficulties, people can't remember how to spell words they once knew and tend to make educated guesses. They could probably correctly guess a predictably spelled word like ""camp,"" but with a more unpredictable spelling like ""sauce,"" they might try ""soss."" In severe cases, people trying to spell ""lion"" might offer things like ""lonp,"" ""lint"" and even ""tiger."" With working memory issues, people know how to spell words but they have trouble choosing the correct letters or assembling the letters in the correct order ""lion"" might be ""liot,"" ""lin,"" ""lino,"" or ""liont."" The team used computer mapping to chart the brain lesions of each individual and found that in the long-term memory cases, damage appeared on two areas of the left hemisphere, one towards the front of the brain and the other at the lower part of the brain towards the back. In working memory cases, the lesions were primarily also in the left hemisphere but in a very different area in the upper part of the brain towards the back. ""I was surprised to see how distant and distinct the brain regions are that support these two subcomponents of the writing process, especially two subcomponents that are so closely inter-related during spelling that some have argued that they shouldn't be thought of as separate functions,"" Rapp said.

Left untreated, depression could have implications for a fetus's health. But treating the disease during pregnancy may carry health risks for the developing fetus, which makes an expecting mother's decision whether to take medication a very difficult one. To better understand how antidepressants affect fetuses during pregnancy, scientists studied exposure in mice. They report their findings in the journal ACS Chemical Neuroscience. See Also: Age matters: Discovering why antidepressants don't work well for kids In recent years, the number of pregnant women taking antidepressants has been on the rise. Studies have suggested that common antidepressants known as selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) could affect the health of these women's children. How they might do this is unclear. For example, pregnancy could affect the metabolism of SSRIs in the body and in turn a fetus's exposure to them. Alexandre Bonnin and colleagues at the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute (University of Southern California) wanted to gain more insight into how SSRIs are metabolized and travel in mothers and their fetuses. The researchers administered a widely prescribed SSRI, citalopram, to pregnant mice and tracked what happened to the drug. They found that the medication and its primary metabolite travel quickly to fetuses and their brains. Also, two hours after administrating the drug, the fetuses had higher concentrations of the drug in their blood than their mothers. In addition, they found important differences in fetal drug exposure depending on the stage of pregnancy.

A team of behavioral scientists studied dogs of different ages working on a specially designed touchscreen computer and discovered that although all dogs were capable of learning, older dogs learned more slowly than younger ones. No age-related differences were found regarding long-term memory. The results are published in the journal Age. The effect of aging on cognitive processes such as learning, memory and logical reasoning have so far been studied almost exclusively in people. See Also: Learning with all the senses: Movements and images facilitate vocabulary learning Using a series of touchscreen tests, Lisa Wallis and Friederike Range have now studied these domains in pet dogs of varying ages. The study was conducted with 95 Border Collies ranging in age from five months to 13 years. The dogs regularly came to the Clever Dog Lab on the Vetmeduni Vienna campus accompanied by their owners to conduct the tests on a touch-sensitive monitor. The dogs were trained to touch symbols on a screen using their nose. Credit: Lisa Wallis/Vetmeduni Vienna   Border Collies have a reputation for being fast learners. They were bred over generations for characteristics that are important in shepherding. In recent years they have become a popular breed of pet dog, probably because they are so easy to train. This is why we had access to enough test animals from this breed,  explains study director Friederike Range. The dogs were divided into five age groups and tested in four tasks. These were designed to test three cognitive abilities: learning, logical reasoning and memory. The tests revealed differences in cognitive ability depending on the age of the dogs. The first part required the animals to learn to correctly select four from a total of eight abstract pictures on a touchscreen. The dogs were shown two pictures on the screen at a time. One picture had a positive association the dogs were rewarded with a food treat for touching this picture while the second picture had a negative association touching this picture did not result in a treat but in a time-out. The four  positive  pictures were presented in different combinations with the  negative  pictures. Learn More: Brain training using sounds can help aging brain ignore distractions  Older dogs required more trials than younger ones before they were able to solve the task correctly. The test also showed that older dogs are less flexible in their way of thinking than younger ones. As in people, older dogs find it more difficult to change old habits or what they have learned,  explains Lisa Wallis, the study s first author. After the Border Collies reached a learning criterion they were again shown two pictures on the touchscreen. This time, one of the pictures was new for the animals. The second  one was familiar from the previous test where it had a negative association. The dogs should identify it as the  wrong  one. The novel picture would therefore be the  correct  one. Hence, the dogs had to choose through inference by exclusion.  The older the dog, the better it performed, while younger dogs were unable to master this task. This is probably due to the fact that older dogs more stubbornly insist on what they have learned before and are less flexible than younger animals,  says Range.  Six months after the first learning tests, the researchers repeated the touchscreen trials using the same eight abstract pictures as before in order to test the dog s long-term memory skills. The test revealed no significant age differences. Nearly all dogs remembered the correct pictures as positive. The results of this study provide measures associated with normal cognitive aging in Border collies, and thus could be used as a basis for breed comparisons as well as early recognition and treatment of certain cognitive deficits.

The new technology, called massively parallel sequencing, is the most advanced tool in the field of forensic biology and can provide more information from each DNA sample including identification and ancestry.  Massively parallel sequencing provides deeper mining of DNA and may provide more information in missing persons or mass disaster cases when an identification using conventional methods fails,  said Hughes-Stamm.  The study will focus on identifying the most efficient sample preparation methods that maximize DNA quality and quantity for sequencing and developing the most effective data interpretation strategies for the vast amount of data-obtaining from the MPS forensic identify panels in order to improve our ability to resolve more missing person cases.  Currently, DNA identification of human remains is performed using reference samples from close family members or direct comparison with personal items used by the victim. However, relatives may not be found, and individual DNA samples may be unreliable. The new MPS systems allow more, and smaller, DNA markers to be analyzed in each sample from badly degraded samples, thus increasing the possibility of success in identifying the deceased. Because MPS represents a fundamental shift in chemistry when identifying human remains, new procedures may be needed to retrieve sufficiently pure DNA prior to sequencing. The study, which will be conducted over a two-year period, will use cadavers from the Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science Facility, one of only six body farms in the country, to test the best DNA extraction methods to maximize the use of MPS technology. Currently, there are two different MPS platforms marketed for forensic applications, and SHSU and UNTHSC each have at least one of the machines, allowing both to be analyzed simultaneously. In addition, the UNTHSC processes the majority of missing person identifications not only for the state of Texas but also for the entire United States. Testing of the new technology will start by first using the current DNA testing methods with challenging biological samples to see how the results will then compare when the two MPS platforms are used, Hughes-Stamm said. The latest NIJ grant follows on the heels of another study conducted for the agency at SHSU, which examined new techniques to preserve tissue samples and speed up the identification process following mass disasters, such as hurricanes, tsunamis, terrorist attacks, wars, or acts of genocide. SHSU is the first institution in the country to offer an interdisciplinary doctoral degree in forensic science to meet the growing needs of public and private crime labs and to train faculty for higher education programs in the expanding field. The program offers courses in controlled substance analysis, trace evidence, pattern evidence, forensic biology, and forensic toxicology, to name a few.","Published: February 3, 2016"

The findings, by researchers from Imperial College London, may help explain why people who have suffered a serious brain injury appear to be at increased risk of dementia. Although extensive research now suggests major head injury increases dementia risk in later life, scientists do not know the biological changes that cause this effect.  The consequences of a head injury have been called a hidden disability - although patients may seem to have outwardly made a good recovery, when we see them in clinic years later they can have persistent problems which affect their daily life, for example impairments in concentration and memory,  said Dr Gregory Scott, the lead author of the paper, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial.  Research is increasingly showing that a blow to the head, such as that sustained in a road accident, triggers biological processes in the brain that burn away in the background for years,"" added Dr Scott.   Although previous research has shown that some head injury patients have these amyloid plaques shortly after the incident, these findings suggest these plaques are still present in the brains of patients over 10 years later. This helps shed light on why brain injury patients seem to be at increased risk of dementia   and may help us develop treatments that reduce this risk.  In the research the team studied nine patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries. Many had sustained these in road traffic accidents, such as being hit by a car, between 11 months to 17 years prior to the study. Although they had no physical disabilities from the injury, many still suffered daily problems with memory and concentration. The patients, who were aged between 38-55, underwent a brain scan that used a technique that allows scientists to view amyloid plaques. These proteins are thought to be a hallmark of Alzheimer s disease, and their formation may trigger other changes that lead to the death of brain cells. The team also scanned the brains of healthy volunteers, and people with Alzheimer s disease. The patients with head injury were found to have more amyloid plaques than the healthy volunteers, but fewer than those with Alzheimer s disease.  In the head injury patients, the amyloid plaques were found to be centred mainly in two brain areas:  the posterior cingulate cortex   a highly active area in the centre of the brain involved in controlling attention and memory, and the cerebellum - a region at the base of the brain involved in motor control and coordination.  In a second part of the study, the team assessed damage to so-called white matter. This is the  wiring  of the brain, and enables brain cells to communicate with each other. The results showed that amyloid plaque levels in the posterior cingulate cortex were related to the amount of white matter damage, suggesting that injury to the brain s wiring may be linked to the formation of amyloid plaques. Although this is small-scale study, explained Dr Scott, it provides hope for developing treatments in the future that may help treat the long-term effects of head injuries. ""This is a preliminary study, and it s important to stress that these head injury patients didn t have Alzheimer s disease. However it supports the idea that the window of treatment for brain injury is potentially months or even years after the initial event. If we can find out exactly what processes are going on in the brain, it may be that we can intervene and improve long-term outcomes for patients. ""The works also highlights how damaging brain injury can be   and fuels the public health debate about what we can do to protect ourselves against head injuries.""","Published: February 3, 2016"

We are delighted to broaden our collaboration with GSK, which is also fully committed to the development of this revolutionary T-cell therapy,  commented James Noble, Adaptimmune s Chief Executive Officer.  We believe that our affinity enhanced T-cell programs have the potential to deliver important clinical benefit to cancer patients, and it is therefore essential that we accelerate our efforts to meet their needs. We are working closely with GSK to expedite development of our affinity enhanced T-cell therapy targeting NY-ESO, and if we succeed in generating pivotal data consistent with that of our ongoing studies, we believe it has the potential to be the first engineered T-cell therapy to reach the market.  Dr. Axel Hoos, SVP Oncology R&D GSK said,  At GSK we re progressing a pipeline of immuno-oncology therapies to stimulate anti-tumor immunity in patients. As we highlighted to investors at our R&D event last year, this Adaptimmune collaboration is a key element of that pipeline and is part of a comprehensive program for cell and gene therapy. With this expanded collaboration, we have the opportunity to accelerate the lead program in synovial sarcoma toward pivotal trials and also to investigate several other tumor types and combine the T-cell therapy with immune-modulating therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors.    Under the terms of the expanded agreement, the companies will accelerate the development of Adaptimmune s NY-ESO therapy into pivotal studies in synovial sarcoma and will explore development in myxoid round cell liposarcoma. Additionally, the companies may initiate up to eight proof-of-principle studies exploring combinations with other therapies, including checkpoint inhibitors. According to the expanded development plan, the studies will be conducted by Adaptimmune with GSK effectively funding the pivotal studies and sharing the costs of the combination studies via a success based milestone structure.   Previous guidance relating to the collaboration disclosed potential cash payments to Adaptimmune of approximately $350m over the first 7 years from 2014 in relation to NY-ESO and two further programs. Given the changes announced today, and the advances made across the collaboration, Adaptimmune is updating and expanding this disclosure. Under the terms of the expanded agreement, the potential development milestones Adaptimmune is eligible to receive solely in relation to the NY-ESO program could amount to approximately $500 million, excluding previously received payments, if GSK exercises its option and successfully develops NY-ESO in more than one indication and more than one Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) type.  In addition, Adaptimmune would receive tiered sales milestones and, as previously disclosed, mid-single to low double digit royalties on worldwide net sales. GSK has the right to nominate up to four additional targets in due course and Adaptimmune is eligible to receive further significant undisclosed milestone payments in relation to these earlier stage target programs. Adaptimmune has also reiterated its prior cash burn guidance, which remains unchanged as the majority of the expansion and acceleration costs will be funded by GSK.

Since the sequencing of the complete human genome in 2000, scientists have puzzled over the role of the remaining 98 per cent. In recent years it has become apparent that a lot of this non-coding DNA is actually transcribed into non-coding RNA. However, there is still a debate as to whether non-coding RNA is just ""noise"" or whether it serves any function in the cell. Part of the reason for this uncertainty is that it is very difficult to knock-out non-coding RNA without damaging the DNA, which can lead to off-target effects and false results. Now a team of scientists from Bath, Cambridge and the USA has identified a piece of non-coding RNA -- transcribed from a stretch of DNA that doesn't code for a protein -- that stops cells turning cancerous. The researchers hope their discovery will help develop new treatments for cancer. Dr Adele Murrell, from the University of Bath's Department of Biology & Biochemistry, led the study. She explained: ""The number of cells in our body are balanced by the level at which cells replicate and replace the ones that die. Sometimes the switches that control this growth get stuck in the 'on' position, which can lead to cancer. ""As the tumour grows and the cancer cells get crowded, they start to break away from the tumour, change shape and are able to burrow through tissues to the bloodstream where they migrate to other parts of the body, which is how the cancer spreads. This process is called metastasis and requires a whole network of genes to regulate the transformation of cell shape and mobilisation. Dr Lovorka Stojic, from Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, the first author of this work identified that GNG12-AS1, a strand of non-coding RNA, prevents the growth switch getting stuck and suppresses metastasis. The specific genomic region where this non-coding RNA is located often gets damaged in breast cancer patients - this control is removed and the cancer cells spread."" She found that this non-coding RNA fragment maintains healthy cells through two mechanisms: Firstly by regulating the levels of DIRAS3, one of its neigbouring genes that is involved in cell replication; secondly by suppressing a network of genes that prepare cells to change their shape and prepare for metastasis. The team were able to distinguish between these two mechanisms by using smaller interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to either specifically stop the non-coding RNA from being made, or to degrade the RNA immediately after it was made. Both approaches led to cells changing their shape and transforming into migratory cells. However, only the first approach affected DIRAS3 and the cell cycle. The team anticipates their findings could be used understand how other non-coding RNAs function and to develop potential gene therapies to treat cancer. The research was funded by Cancer Research UK. Dr Kat Arney, science communication manager at Cancer Research UK, said: ""Only a tiny fraction of our DNA contains actual genes, and we know that at least some of the bits in between - often dismissed as 'junk' - play important roles in controlling how genes get switched on and off at the right time and in the right place. ""Research like this is helping is to unpick the precise details about how these regions work, shedding light on their potential role in the development of cancer and pointing towards new approaches for tackling the disease.","Published: February 3, 2016"

For this potential to be realized, however, scientists must find a way to safely deliver the CRISPR machinery and a corrected copy of the DNA into the diseased cells.   MIT researchers have now developed a way to deliver the CRISPR genome repair components more efficiently than previously possible, and they also believe it may be safer for human use. In a study of mice, they found that they could correct the mutated gene that causes a rare liver disorder, in 6 percent of liver cells   enough to cure the mice of the disease, known as tyrosinemia.  This finding really excites us because it makes us think that this is a gene repair system that could be used to treat a range of diseases   not just tyrosinemia but others as well,  says Daniel Anderson, associate professor in MIT s Department of Chemical Engineering and a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES). Anderson is one of the senior authors of a paper describing the findings. Wen Xue, an assistant professor in molecular medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, is also a senior author. The paper s lead author is Hao Yin, a research scientist at the Koch Institute. Find and replace The CRISPR system relies on cellular machinery that bacteria use to defend themselves from viral infection. Researchers have previously harnessed this system to create gene-editing complexes composed of a DNA-cutting enzyme called Cas9 and a short RNA that guides the enzyme to a specific area of the genome, directing Cas9 where to make its cut. When Cas9 and the short guide RNA targeting a disease gene are delivered into cells, a specific cut is made in the genome, and the cells  DNA repair processes glue the cut back together, often deleting a small portion of the genome. However, if a corrected copy of the gene is also delivered when the cut is made, the DNA repair can lead to correction of the disease gene, permanently repairing the genome. In 2014, Anderson and colleagues described the first use of CRISPR to repair a disease gene in an adult animal. In that study, they were able to cure tyrosinemia in mice. However, delivery of the genetic components required a high-pressure injection, a method that can also cause some damage to the liver.  That was the first demonstration of using CRISPR/Cas9 to do genetic repair in an adult animal,  Anderson says.  We were excited by this demonstration but wanted to find a way to develop a drug form of the repair machinery that would be both safer and more efficient.  The researchers also wanted to boost the percentage of cells that had the defective gene replaced. In the previous study, about one in 250 liver cells were repaired, which was enough to successfully treat tyrosinemia. However, for many other diseases, a higher percentage of repair would be needed to provide a therapeutic effect. In the new study, Anderson and colleagues developed a combined nanoparticle and viral delivery system to deliver the CRISPR repair machinery. First, they created a nanoparticle from lipids and messenger RNA (mRNA) that encoded the Cas9 enzyme. The other two components   the RNA guide strand and the DNA for the corrected gene   were embedded into a reprogrammed viral particle based on an adeno-associated virus (AAV). The researchers first injected the virus about a week before the lipid nanoparticles, giving the liver cells time to begin producing the RNA guide strand and the DNA template. When the nanoparticles carrying the Cas9 mRNA strand were injected, the cells began producing the Cas9 protein, but only for a few days because the mRNA eventually degraded. This is long enough to perform gene repair, but prevents cas9 from lingering in the cells and potentially disrupting other parts of the cells  genome.   There s some concern that if you had Cas9 in your cells for too long of a period of time, it might cause some genomic instability,  Anderson says.  We think the use of the mRNA nanoparticle provides an additional level of safety by making sure the enzyme is not present for too long a period of time.  High accuracy With this method, about one in 16 cells had the gene corrected, a 15-fold improvement over the 2014 study. The researchers also found that this approach generated less off-target DNA cutting than methods in which the Cas9 gene is integrated into a cell s genome.  We did a genome-scale analysis and we have a very high level of on-target effects but almost no off-target effects,  Yin says.  This is quite a promising development,  says Terence Flotte, dean of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, who was not part of the research team.  This combination of two different delivery modalities solves a number of hurdles that would otherwise make it difficult to do a gene correction in hepatocytes.  Anderson s lab has developed similar lipid nanoparticles that are now in clinical development. AAV viral particles are in clinical trials for other purposes, making the researchers optimistic that this CRISPR delivery method could be used in humans, although more studies are needed. The researchers have applied for patents on this technique, which they believe could be used to treat wide range of diseases, especially those of the liver.  There are a range of metabolic diseases and other liver disorders where if you fix a mutated gene you might be really able to have an impact on human health,  Anderson says.

In addition to their potential to bring much-needed precision and safety to the form of cancer immunotherapy known as CAR T cell therapy, these versatile new sensors, known as synNotch receptors, can also be inserted into cells such as nerve and muscle cells. The receptors may have uses in regenerative medicine, in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, and in basic biological research.  SynNotch receptors provide us with one of the most flexible ways we have to reprogram the behavior and function of almost any cell,  said Wendell A. Lim, PhD, chair and professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at UCSF, and senior author of the two new papers.  One of the most exciting applications is in engineering therapeutic cells   we can now provide these cells with highly precise instructions about how to recognize and respond to disease.  CAR T cell therapy has been much in the news for its unprecedented success in treating a form of blood cancer known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL. CAR T cells are so-called because an engineered Chimeric Antigen Receptor   a T cell receptor with an antibody  head  that recognizes a specific cancer-associated molecule called an antigen   is inserted into the immune system s T cells to guide them to tumor cells, which they then kill. The therapy works well in ALL because the disease affects white blood cells known as B cells, all of which carry a unique antigen known as CD19. By designing the CAR antibody head to target CD19, B cells can be selectively eradicated. A major side effect of this treatment, however, is that healthy B cells carrying the CD19 antigen are also eliminated by CAR T therapy, a loss that patients are generally able to tolerate. But CAR T cell therapy has not been effective against the solid tumors that affect the breast, prostate, brain, lungs, and other organs, because   unlike in B cells   there is no single target antigen present in these tumors that is not also found in healthy cells. As a result, CAR T cell therapy directed at antigens in solid tumors has caused serious, sometimes lethal side effects when healthy tissues are also attacked by the CAR T cells. To get around this problem, said Lim, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and director of the UCSF Center for Systems and Synthetic Biology, CAR T cells need to be able to finely discriminate between cancer cells and healthy cells. The UCSF team accomplished this goal with synNotch, using the new sensor to create a cellular  AND gate  that endows T cells with the sort of precision that Boolean search terms bring to Internet search engines. In effect, synNotch can direct T cells to perform tasks such as  find cells with tumor antigen A, but activate the T cell s killing program only when tumor antigen B is also present.  The synNotch receptor is an engineered version of a naturally occurring receptor called Notch, which plays crucial roles in the body s development from embryo to adult. Notch, which sticks through cell walls like a straw though a coconut shell, works in a unique fashion. When the portion of Notch protruding outside the cell recognizes a particular target molecule, the section within the cell is released, freeing this portion to travel to the cell nucleus, where it switches specific genes on or off. The UCSF team, led by Leonardo Morsut, PhD, and Kole T. Roybal, PhD, both postdoctoral fellows in the Lim laboratory, found that they could exploit this unusual configuration by swapping out the Notch components that lie outside and inside the cell with components that match a desired biological function. The product of this modular engineering strategy is synNotch, a receptor that can recognize any target molecule, and in response, execute any genetic program. For the version of synNotch described in Cell, Roybal customized the extracellular portion of Notch so the receptor would recognize an antigen found on tumors, and inserted the synNotch receptor into T cells. The intracellular portion of Notch was also tweaked, so that it would activate the genes necessary to create a CAR in the same cell. The CAR was designed to recognize a tumor antigen different from the antigen recognized by the synNotch receptor. The researchers then implanted two distinct tumors into mice, one expressing only the antigen targeted by the CAR, and the other expressing both the antigen recognized by the CAR and that recognized by the synNotch receptor. When synNotch-equipped T cells were injected into the mice, the T cells did not attack tumors expressing only the antigen targeted by the CAR, because the synNotch activation necessary for the CAR to be present did not occur. If both antigens were present, however, synNotch activation prompted the expression of the CAR receptor, which then recognized the second antigen and launched the T cell s killing program. The synNotch-equipped T cells were remarkably effective and selective: they completely eradicated tumors expressing both antigens, and the effect was durable   all the mice who carried these double-antigen tumors remained alive when the experiments were concluded, 30 days after treatment. Lim said it is possible to insert multiple synNotch receptors into CAR T cells, but he believes that only one to three synNotch receptors may be necessary to considerably enhance the selectivity of these cells. Through genomic sequencing it should be possible to identify unique combinations of proteins that occur only in a patient s tumor and not in his or her healthy cells, he said, and then create synNotch CAR T cells to precisely target the cancer.  The kinds of engineered T cells that we can now construct give us the exciting potential to create precision cancer therapeutics that take advantage of all the genomic and proteomic information we are currently gathering on disease,  said Lim.  This genomic information now becomes actionable. ","Published: February 3, 2016"

But many of these test methods still present problems. A microreactor developed as part of an EU-funded collaborative research project enables cultured liver cells to be used as test samples. Unlike animal testing, this novel method enables the assessment of potentially toxic substances on tissue in real time.  Serious efforts are underway to significantly reduce the number of animal tests carried out for research purposes. The latest EU Cosmetics Regulation, which came into force in 2013, bans the sale of cosmetic products containing ingredients that have been tested on animals. But it is difficult to find alternatives, not only for the cosmetics industry but also in the field of pharmaceutical research. In many cases, there are no other suitable methods of toxicity testing available. Numerous research groups are therefore working on the development of new, viable test formats.  One of the most promising approaches involves the use of cultured liver cells. The liver is the most important organ when it comes to eliminating toxins from the body. It therefore makes sense to use liver cells to test the toxicity of substances. But this isn t as easy as it sounds. It has to be ensured that all cells are equally exposed to the substance being tested. And a further problem in the case of liver cells is that they rarely survive for longer than a few days in a laboratory environment. This makes it virtually impossible to carry out experiments to determine the long-term effect of toxic substances on a living organism.  Watching how liver cells react in real time  As part of the HeMiBio (Hepatic Microfl uidic Bioreactor) project, researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology IZI in Potsdam in collaboration with partners at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have developed a microbioreactor in which liver cells can be kept alive and observed for a period of one month. The particular advantage of this device is that it allows researchers to watch how liver cells react to toxic substances directly and in real time.  Up to now, both in animal testing and in conventional lab tests, measurements have usually only been made at the end of the test,  says Dr. Claus Duschl, head of the cellular biotechnology department at the IZI.  The procedure consists of administering different doses of an active ingredient and subsequently analyzing the areas of dead tissue or the dead animal. It is not possible to determine the precise effect of the active ingredient on the cells using this method.  Sensors measure oxygen consumption  The microbioreactor changes all this. Its miniature sensors gather real-time data on the amount of oxygen being taken up by the liver cells at any instant. Oxygen consumption is high when the cell s metabolism is stimulated. If the cell dies, the oxygen consumption falls. By reading this curve, cell biologists are even capable of pinpointing the metabolic processes taking place in a cell at a specific point in time. The HeMiBio project partners make use of this information. When a toxic substance is placed in the microreactor, the sensors record a detailed picture of the changing levels of oxygen consumption. These measurements make it possible to precisely identify the stages of the metabolic process that are affected or halted by the active ingredient.  While working on this project with cell biologists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, we have been able to verify various hypotheses by selectively replacing specific metabolic products whose synthesis had been blocked by the toxic substance,  Duschl explains.  As we had surmised, the metabolic process then continued unaffected to the next stage.  One of the tasks of Duschl s team was to design a suitable reactor vessel containing numerous microfluidic channels, in collaboration with their partners in Israel. One of the main challenges was to ensure that all cells were equally supplied with the growth medium, so they are evenly distributed and do not form clumps. But this fi ne distribution was a source of other problems, for the wider the distance between the cells, the weaker the signals captured by the sensors.  What we needed was a sensor technology capable of dealing with a high concentration of cells, without the risk of interference effects that would falsify the test results.  The IZI project team came up with the idea of using tiny polymer particles containing a luminescent dye. This dye emits a phosphorescent glow when exposed to a monochromatic LED light source, which excites individual electrons and raises them to a higher energy level. The electrons return to their original energy level within a fraction of a second, and the remaining energy is emitted in the form of phosphorescent light. The time required by the electrons to lower their energy level is directly related to the concentration of oxygen in the surrounding air.  In other words, the time this takes indicates the presence of metabolic activity, and can be used to measure the effect of the toxic substance.  This is an important factor because it enables scientists to gain a better understanding of the way specific categories of substances affect the human organism and understand why some of them are toxic while others have a therapeutic effect.  Simulating metabolic processes  The participants in the project have proved that the microreactor functions as intended. But they still have plenty more work to do. Because many different types of cells are active in the liver, the researchers now want to populate the reactor with various combinations of cells.  In this way, we will be able to improve our ability to simulate metabolic processes,  says Duschl. Eventually the researchers hope to be able to combine tissue samples from different organs in a single reactor.  But we still have a long way to go,  says Duschl. Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration IZM in Berlin are also participating in the HeMeBio project. In collaboration with colleagues in Belgium, they have developed a more advanced reactor based on highly complex microfluidic structures. The first tests are underway, and the results are extremely promising. ","Published: February 3, 2016"

We don t know, scientifically speaking, what exactly it is. We do know for sure when it ends, but to make matters even more inscrutable, the timing of death is determined by factors that are in many cases statistically random. Researchers in the lab of Walter Fontana, Harvard Medical School professor of systems biology, have found patterns in this randomness that provide clues into the biological basis of aging. The research team, led by Novartis Fellow Nicholas Stroustrup, found a surprising statistical regularity in how a variety of genetic and environmental factors affect the life span of the Caenorhabditis elegans worm. Their findings suggest that aging does not have a single discrete molecular cause but is rather a systemic process involving many components within a complex biological network. Perturb any node in the system, and you affect the whole thing. The study offers an alternative to research that seeks to identify a specific master aging mechanism, such as protein homeostasis or DNA damage.  There are many important molecular changes that occur with age, but it might not make sense to call all of them  causes of aging,  per se,  said Stroustrup, first author on the paper.  Off the shelf In order to study life span dynamics at the population level, Stroustrup constructed the Lifespan Machine, a device comprising 50 off-the-shelf flatbed scanners purchased from an office supplies store. Each scanner has been retooled to record 16 petri dishes every hour, totaling 800 dishes and 30,000 worms. The scanners capture images at 3,200 dots per inch, which is a resolution high enough to detect movements of eight micrometers, or about 12 percent of the width of an average worm. Stroustrup subjected the worms to interventions as diverse as temperature changes, oxidative stress, changes in diet and genetic manipulations that altered, for example, insulin growth factor signaling. The Lifespan Machine recorded how long it took the worms to die under each condition. Stroustrup then aggregated the data, generated life span distribution curves for each intervention and compared results. The life span distributions provided considerably more information than just changes in average life span. The research team measured variations arising in ostensibly identical individuals, looking at how many worms died young versus how many made it to old age under each condition. This comprehensive view was important for capturing the dynamics and randomness in the aging process. Clear as a bell curve In one sense, the findings were not surprising: different circumstances produced different life spans. Turning up the heat caused the worms to die quickly, and turning it up higher only increased that rate. Pictured as bell-shaped distributions, certain interventions produced a thinner, high-peaked bell, while others resulted in a more drawn-out and protracted bell. Despite these obvious differences, the researchers found an unexpected uniformity among the curves, observing what statisticians call  temporal scaling.  Stated for the rest of us, if you were to take all of the bell-shaped curves and expand or contract them along the X-axes (which in this study represented time), they would become statistically indistinguishable. Simply compressing the protracted bell would produce a high-peaked bell, or vice versa. The two bells have, in a rigorous sense, the same shape. The various interventions seemed to affect the duration of life in the same way across all individuals in the same population, regardless of whether chance or randomness had a short or long life in store for them. No matter which genetic process or environmental factor the researchers targeted, all molecular causes of death seemed to be affected at once and to the same extent.  Life span is a whole-organism property,  said Fontana,  and it is profoundly difficult to study it molecularly in real time. But by discovering this kind of statistical regularity about the endpoint of aging, we have learned something about the aging process that determines that endpoint.  Most important, said Fontana, this regularity suggests that there is profound interdependence in the physiology of an organism, and changes in one physiological aspect affect all others to determine life span. The researchers believe that their discovery will influence how scientists study, and even define, aging for people as well as worms.  The researchers now plan to study in more detail how broad statistical regularities can emerge from the action of diverse molecular mechanisms, seeking to determine exactly how alteration of one mechanism can affect all others.","Published: February 3, 2016"

Reproducing Lewy bodies in animals in order to model the disease for research and drug screening has proven notoriously difficult, leaving a gap in Parkinson s research and treatment. EPFL scientists have now shown where the discrepancy between humans and animals lies. Using the knowledge, the scientists have produced cellular and mouse models that reproduce the evolution of Parkinson s disease more accurately for both fundamental research and drug development.  A century-long problem Lewy bodies consist mainly of a protein called  alpha-synuclein . Abundant in the brain, alpha-synuclein is normally involved in the transmission of neuronal signals. But in Parkinson s disease, alpha-synuclein clumps up, aggregates and finally tangles into stringy knots called fibrils; these are what form the Lewy bodies. Even though this has been known for almost a century, we still do not know why they form or how they contribute the progression of Parkinson s disease. The main reason is that we do not have animal models that accurately reproduce the formation of Lewy bodies. In humans, Lewy bodies form when the brain produces twice the normal amount of alpha-synuclein. When mice, which are often used to model human diseases, are used to model Parkinson s, they are genetically engineered to overproduce it. But human alpha-synuclein does not form fibrils and Lewy bodies when produced in mice. The homologue interaction Mice produce three types of their own synuclein, which are similar to human alpha-synuclein. Because of this, they are referred to as its  homologues . One possibility is that the way human alpha-synuclein interacts with its homologues might be preventing it from forming Lewy bodies in mice. To determine if this is the case, Hilal Lashuel and his team at EPFL looked at what happened when human alpha-synuclein was produced in neurons from mice that were genetically engineered to miss either one or all three of their synuclein homologues. The study, led by PhD student Mohamed-Bilal Fares, showed that mouse neurons that were missing one or all three homologues successfully formed clumps that are similar to Lewy bodies. Tests on mouse brains yielded similar results. Finally, the scientists found that the mouse homologues directly interact with earlier intermediates formed during the aggregation of human alpha-synuclein into Lewy bodies. The mouse homologies interfere with their growth and spread throughout the brain. What all this means is that human alpha-synuclein does not form Lewy bodies in mice because its homologues in the animal prevent it from doing so. This discovery explains why it is so difficult to model Parkinson s disease in normal mice, which have all of their synuclein homologues. In other words, the key to successfully modeling the disease in mice is to genetically suppress their homologues of human alpha-synuclein. A new model Working off their genetically engineered mice and neuronal cultures, the team developed and characterized new models for Lewy bodies for the scientific and medical community. Hilal Lashuel expects that the new insights will advance the development of neuronal and in vivo models that reproduce features of Parkinson s disease, and allow screening for new drugs.  We now have a very well-characterized model that offers a powerful tool for rapid screening of molecular pathways involved in Parkinson s disease,  he says.  But because it can also allow us to understand how human alpha-synuclein forms fibrils inside neurons and how that contributes to the progression of the disease, we can develop better drugs and intervention strategies to prevent this disease.

It is the ability of iPSCs to differentiate to other cell types that makes them so valuable for laboratory research, however not all iPSCs offer the same differentiation capacity, some cell lines are markedly defective. ""When generating iPSCs it is clearly beneficial to identify 'good' and 'bad' cell lines"" explains Dr Lee Stirling, who led the research team whilst a Research Associate at the UCL Cancer Institute. ""Good cell lines offer optimal differentiation capacity and are therefore the most useful for research. However establishing the quality of these cell lines using traditional ways of assessment is costly and time-consuming. We were looking to find a way to expedite this process and we think part of the solution lies in using DNA methylation as a biomarker for differentiation capacity"". DNA methylation is a physical modification to the genetic material (DNA) of a cell, which can alter the behaviour of that cell. In this study, the team were looking for a particular type of methylation that only occurs in stem cells, known as non-CG methylation, to see if they could identify a link between non-CG methylation and differentiation capacity of iPSCs. Dr Stirling says: ""The role of a pluripotent stem cell is to generate all three germ layers: mesoderm, endoderm and ectoderm. These germ layers then develop into all cells of the body. For this study, we focussed specifically on a pluripotent stem cell's ability to differentiate into the endodermal lineage - the lineage for organs such as liver, pancreas and thyroid gland. Once we had collected and examined our data we were immediately struck by a link - we could confidently report that a reduction in non-CG methylation is associated with impaired differentiation capacity into endodermal lineages."" ""The main point of this study is that we have found an epigenetic biomarker that can help us distinguish iPSCs that have a diminished capacity for differentiation. This discovery can be used to reduce costly and time-consuming analysis methods, while simultaneously offering improvements in large-scale assessment of iPSC lines for clinical and therapeutic applications."" adds Dr Stirling. The research team hope that not only will their discovery be used in the short-term as an efficient analysis method of cell lines for research purposes but, going forward, findings can be used as a starting point for discovering the developmental processes associated with methylation patterns in iPSCs. Dr Stirling concludes: ""In time, I'm confident that understanding these principles will impact our understanding of cancer cell behaviour and, eventually, form a solid base for regenerative medicine strategies.""","Published: February 3, 2016"

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/mapping-regulatory-elements-200212,Mapping Regulatory Elements Systematically searching DNA for regulatory elements indicates limits of previous thinking ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. All the tissues in the human body are made from proteins, and for every protein, there s a stretch of DNA in the human genome that  codes  for it, or describes the sequence of amino acids that will produce it. But these coding regions constitute only about 1 percent of the genome, and scattered throughout the other 99 percent are sequences involved in regulating gene expression, or determining which coding regions will be translated into proteins. And when. Researchers at MIT and Harvard Medical School describe a new technique for systematically but efficiently searching long stretches of the genome for regulatory elements. And in their first application of the technique, they find evidence that current thinking about gene regulation is incomplete.  Conventional assays have chopped out little pieces of the genome and asked whether they re sufficient for driving gene expression,  says David Gifford, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT and one of the new paper s senior authors.  There are two limitations to that. The first is that it may be that something is sufficient for gene activation, but that does not mean that it s necessary. And vice versa: If something is necessary, it may not be sufficient. So these assays really don t reveal the complete story on the function of genomic DNA.   The other problem with these assays is that they are not done in a native context,  Gifford adds   that is, the excised segments of DNA are not in their normal location within the genome.  We were interested in using a direct assay that revealed the necessity of a genomic sequence in its native context   in the cell, in the place in the genome where it normally resides. We mutate it right where it normally functions.  Nisha Rajagopal, a postdoc in Gifford s group, is lead author on the paper. Richard Sherwood, a research fellow at Harvard Medical School, is the other senior author, and they re joined by seven other researchers in both Gifford s and Sherwood s groups. Unmarked paths In recent years, one of the main techniques for identifying regulatory elements in the genome has been the use of so-called histone marks. In the cell, DNA is usually wrapped into tight coils around proteins called histones. The ends of the histones frequently have modifications   such as the addition of acetyl or methyl groups. Those modifications are the histone marks, and certain marks appear to be associated with the suppression or promotion of gene expression. Biologists find histones bearing these marks, slice out the segments of DNA wrapped around them, and sequence the DNA. When they find the corresponding sequences in the map of the genome, they can begin conducting narrowly targeted experiments to try to identify regulatory elements. The MIT and Harvard researchers  technique, however, has identified regions of the genome that appear to play a crucial role in gene regulation, but which have not previously been associated with histone marks.  Science is always subject to a set of assumptions,  Gifford says.  What this whole study demonstrates, in my opinion, is that it s important to think carefully about our assumptions. It doesn't disprove the assumptions categorically, but it in some sense demands further exploration of what is necessary for genomic function.  Gifford and his colleagues  technique is an application of the CRISPR gene-editing system. CRISPR is a method for cutting DNA; the researchers found a way to space those cuts at regular intervals around a protein-coding region of interest. In the new paper, they report experiments in which they exhaustively searched spans of tens of thousands of base pairs, or DNA letters, around each of four known protein-coding regions. RNA guides To make cuts at regular intervals, the researchers designed 4,000 guide RNAs, small biological molecules that lead the CRISPR cutting enzyme to the right locations in the genome. In the researchers  experiments, the guide RNAs are manufactured inside the cell. For all the guide RNAs, the researchers constructed DNA templates, which the cells naturally absorbed. On average, each DNA template showed up in about 1,000 cells. Each cell converted exactly one DNA template into a guide RNA, which led the CRISPR cutting enzyme to a specific location in the genome. At each of those locations, the CRISPR enzyme cut the DNA. When the cells tried to repair those cuts, the DNA sequences at the repair sites became garbled. In some cases, the garbling prevented the cells from manufacturing the appropriate proteins, indicating regions of functional importance. The researchers then conducted a second set of experiments, targeting just those regions, to determine the precise sequences whose modification interrupted protein production. Around each of the four protein-coding sequences they investigated, they found multiple stretches of roughly 1,000 base pairs that showed strong signs of regulatory activity, but which histone marks had not previously identified. It could be, Gifford says, that those stretches were present in only a subset of cells, and that they were in fact associated with histone marks; the standard technique for identifying histone modifications relies on average measurements across the cell population, so it could miss outliers. Gifford, Rajagopal, and colleagues are continuing to investigate these regions, to determine just what s going in them.","Published: February 3, 2016"

Many manufacturers stopped used bisphenol A, a chemical that is used to strengthen plastic, after studies linked it to early puberty and a rise in breast and prostate cancers However, bisphenol S, or BPS, a common replacement for BPA in plastics, has also been linked to health risks. New UCLA-led research demonstrates some of the mechanisms that make BPS just as harmful as BPA. The study found that BPS speeds up embryonic development and disrupts the reproductive system in animals.  Our study shows that making plastic products with BPA alternatives does not necessarily leave them safer,  said Nancy Wayne, the study s senior author, a reproductive endocrinologist and professor of physiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.  Our findings are frightening   consider it the aquatic version of the canary in the coal mine.  Wayne and her colleagues found that when zebrafish were exposed to either BPA or BPS at low levels   equivalent to the traces found in polluted river waters   their physiology at the embryonic stage changed in as quickly as 25 hours.  Egg-hatching time accelerated, leading to premature birth,  said Wayne, who is also UCLA s associate vice chancellor for research.  The embryos developed much faster than normal in the presence of BPA or BPS.  The research team studied zebrafish because their transparent embryos make it relatively easy to  watch  cell growth as it occurs. Using fluorescent-green protein tags, the researchers tracked the development of the animals  reproductive endocrine brain cells, which control puberty and fertility. They discovered that the number of endocrine neurons increased up to 40 percent, suggesting that BPA overstimulates the reproductive system.  Exposure to low levels of BPA had a significant impact on the embryos  development of brain cells that control reproduction and the genes that control reproduction later in life,  Wayne said.  We saw many of these same effects with BPS found in BPA-free products. BPS is not harmless.  Wayne s lab plans to investigate in a future study whether, as she suspects, overstimulation of the neurons that regulate reproduction leads to premature puberty and disruption of the reproductive system. Wayne practices what she preaches. After completing a study on BPA in 2008, she immediately discarded all of the plastic food containers in her home and replaced them with glass. She and her family purchase food and drinks packaged in glass whenever possible. The researchers also were surprised to find that both BPA and BPS exert their effects partly through an estrogen system and partly through a thyroid hormone system.  Most people think of BPA as mimicking the effects of estrogen,  Wayne said.  But our work shows that it also mimics the actions of thyroid hormone.  Thyroid hormone has a significant influence on brain development during gestation, so the research could have important implications for understanding general embryonic and fetal development, including in humans, Wayne said. Researchers have proposed that endocrine-disrupting chemicals may be contributing to the rise in premature human births and early onset of puberty over the past couple of decades in the U.S.  Our data supports that hypothesis,  Wayne said.  If BPA is impacting a wide variety of animal species, then it s likely to be affecting human health.  BPA can leach into food and beverages, particularly under heat, from cans, baby bottles, food-storage containers and plastic tableware. It can also be found in contact lenses, eyeglass lenses, compact discs, water-supply pipes, cash register and ATM receipts, and dental sealants and composites. One study published in 2010 projected that by 2015, the U.S. and Europe would be manufacturing more than 5 million tons of products containing BPA per year.","Published: February 3, 2016"

Delivery of the vector to newborn mice improved their survival while treatment of adult animals, unexpectedly, made them worse, according to a new study by investigators from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania   Correcting a disease-causing mutation following birth in this animal model brings us one step closer to realizing the potential of personalized medicine,  said senior author James Wilson, MD, PhD, a professor of Medicine and director of the Orphan Disease Center at Penn.  Nevertheless, my 35-year career in gene therapy has taught me how difficult translating mouse studies to successful human treatments can be. From this study, we are now adjusting the gene-editing system in the next phases of our investigation to address the unforeseen complications seen in adult animals.  Wilson is also director of the Penn Gene Therapy Program. The Wilson lab focused on liver as a target for gene editing since they had solved the problem of gene delivery in this organ in previous work using traditional gene therapy using vectors based on adeno-associated virus (AAV). However, gene replacement therapy with AAV is not ideal for treating genetic diseases of the liver that manifest as newborns since the non-integrating genome is lost as developing liver cells proliferate. Because of this Wilson, co-first author Lili Wang, PhD, a research associate professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and collaborators, thought that the newborn liver might be an ideal organ for AAV-mediated gene correction using CRISPR-Cas9, an RNA-guided genome-editing technology that uses the bacteria protein Cas9. With CRISPR-Cas9 the corrected mutation will persist as the vector genome is lost.   This hypothesis was tested in a mouse model of a rare metabolic urea-cycle disorder caused by a deficiency in an enzyme called ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC). The urea cycle is a series of six liver enzymes that help rid the body of ammonia, a breakdown product of protein metabolism. When one of these enzymes is missing or deficient, ammonia accumulates in the blood and travels to the brain, causing a multitude of problems, including brain damage and death. OTC deficiency is the most common of the urea-cycle disorders, occurring in one out of every 40,000 births. A mutated OTC gene can cause an enzyme that is shorter than normal, the wrong shape, or may not be produced at all. The genetic mutation responsible for OTC occurs on the X chromosome, so women are typically carriers, while their sons with the mutated gene suffer the disease. Cut-and-Paste The team injected two AAVs (specifically an AAV8 serotype discovered in the Wilson lab that has an affinity for liver cells), one expressing Cas9 and the other expressing a guide RNA and a donor DNA, into newborn mice with OTC deficiency.   One AAV ferried the Cas9 enzyme via a liver-specific promoter to ensure it only expresses in liver cells when injected into the blood. The other AAV in the dual system ferried a guide RNA   a 20-base string of genetic building blocks followed by another sequence to lead the Cas9 enzyme to the correct spot within the DNA in the nucleus of the liver cell. The second AAV also contained a donor DNA template to correct the mutation so that the normal OTC protein can be made by the cell. The addition of this donor DNA to actually correct a mutation distinguishes this study from other recent genome-editing research findings that circumvent a mutation by deleting a portion of the normal gene. This whole correction system is basically a  Cut-and-Paste  function, with the last part of the  Paste  phase relying on the cells  own DNA repair mechanism to properly join the OTC gene back together again. In the newborn mice, injection of the AAV system reverted the mutation in 10 percent of liver cells, on average, as measured by the presence of the OTC enzyme in liver cells. They also saw an increased survival in young mice challenged with a high-protein diet, which makes OTC-deficient symptoms worse in the mice. In contrast, more than 30 percent of the untreated OTC-deficient mice died after a week and their ammonia levels were significantly higher than the OTC mice whose genes were corrected. Deep sequencing of DNA isolated from liver cells in the treated mice also showed that correction to the mutation was consistent with the survival results. On the other hand, gene correction in adult, eight-to-ten-week-old OTC-deficient mice was lower using the same dual-AAV system. The adults also showed diminished protein tolerance and lethal hyperammonia on a normal chow diet. After three weeks, the adult mice on a low dose of the gene correction started to die, and counterintuitively, mice given a high dose started to die nine days after injection.  We were surprised by these results, but after some further investigation we deciphered the mechanism by which gene editing worsened the condition of the adult animals,  Wang said. Looking at the DNA sequence in liver cells in adult mice, they found that the frequency of cells that had a corrected Paste function was only about one percent.  This was certainly not enough to help these adult mice,  Wang noted. What was more problematic, and completely unexpected, is that many of the uncorrected genes contained large deletions that eliminated the residual activity of the mutant OTC gene. The first step in correcting the gene is the creation of a break in the DNA by Cas9 in proximity to the mutation (the Cut) which, in the presence of the donor DNA,  sets the stage for correction of the mutation in what is termed homology directed repair (HDR or the Paste).  It appears that HDR is more efficient in newborn liver cells than in adult liver cells.  Wilson said. In the absence of HDR the cell will repair the cut using another process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) that leaves in its wake small insertions or deletions. The team directed the cut to a part of the OTCgene that, if perturbed by a small insertion or deletion, would not interfere with the residual function of the mutant OTC gene. This was the case in newborn mice. The team learned, however, that NHEJ in adult liver cells resulted in much larger deletions, some of which eliminated any residual function of the OTC gene. The net result of low rates of the Paste with responses to the Cut that destroyed the remaining gene function in many cells resulted in lower tolerance to protein in adult mice.  The ontoward consequences of gene editing observed in adult OTC mice is limited to treating genetic diseases in which the mutation diminishes but does not eliminate function,  Wilson explained. In an attempt to avoid this problem in certain adult patients with liver diseases, the team is exploring methods to create the Cut without inciting the large deletions while at the same time, driving higher frequencies of the Paste. Yang Yang, PhD, a visiting scientist in the Wilson lab, is also a co-first author.","Published: February 3, 2016"

Innovations has committed  10.0 million to the round alongside existing investors Cambridge Innovation Capital, and Johnson and Johnson Innovation (JJDC) who also participated in the round, as did new investor Woodford Patient Capital Trust. Inivata is a clinical cancer genomics company harnessing the emerging potential of circulating DNA analysis to improve testing and treatment for oncologists and their patients. Unlike conventional invasive biopsies, Inivata detects and analyses genomic material from a cancer patient s cell-free, circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) which can be collected through a simple blood sample. This minimally-invasive approach   a liquid biopsy   offers a revolution in how cancer is detected, monitored and treated. The test allows precise analysis of cancer-related mutations present in ctDNA, and is designed to provide oncologists with clinically actionable genomic information to guide therapy selection, monitor treatment progress and detect new mutations as they emerge. As of 31 July 2015, Innovations had invested  1.5 million in Inivata with a net carrying value of  1.5 million. Following this new investment, Innovations will have increased its investment to  11.5 million and the Group will hold a 30.6% interest in the Company. Dr Rob Woodman, Director of Healthcare Ventures, Imperial Innovations added:  Analysis of ctDNA has the potential to transform cancer care and resolve many of the limitations inherent in current tissue-based standard protocols that are highly invasive and are not amenable to serial monitoring.  Innovations led a seed financing round for Inivata in September 2014. The fact that the Company has secured funding of this size reflects the great progress it has made in such a short time, not least in developing innovative molecular profiling and monitoring products.  Inivata is already widely recognized as a leader in the field of ctDNA analysis. This new funding will be used to accelerate clinical studies to demonstrate the clinical benefits of Inivata s approach and provides a strong platform for the Company to roll these products out.

The consortium is made possible by a $21 million contract from the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) and aims to discover the brain's learning rules and synaptic 'circuit design', further helping to advance neurally-derived machine learning algorithms. The consortium will leverage the Wyss Institute's FISSEQ (fluorescent in-situ sequencing) method to push forward neuronal connectomics, the science of identifying the neuronal cells that work together to bring about specific brain functions. FISSEQ was developed in 2014 by the Wyss Core Faculty member George Church and colleagues and, unlike traditional sequencing technologies, it provides a method to pinpoint the precise locations of specific RNA molecules in intact tissue. The consortium will harness this FISSEQ capability to accurately trace the complete set of neuronal cells and their connecting processes in intact brain tissue over long distances, which is currently difficult to do with other methods. Awarded a competitive IARPA MICrONS contract, the consortium will further the overall goals of President Obama's BRAIN initiative, which aims to improve the understanding of the human mind and uncover new ways to treat neuropathological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, autism and epilepsy. The consortium's work will fundamentally innovate the technological framework used to decipher the principal circuits neurons use to communicate and fulfill specific brain functions. The learnings can be applied to enhance artificial intelligence in different areas of machine learning such as fraud detection, pattern and image recognition, and self-driving car decision making. ""Historically, the mapping of neuronal paths and circuits in the brain has required brain tissue to be sectioned and visualized by electron microscopy. Complete neurons and circuits are then reconstructed by aligning the individual electron microsope images, this process is costly and inaccurate due to use of only one color (grey),"" said Church, who is the Principal Investigator for the IARPA MICrONs consortium. ""We are taking an entirely new approach to neuronal connectomics-immensely colorful barcodes-that should overcome this obstacle; and by integrating molecular and physiological information we are looking to render a high-definition map of neuronal circuits dedicated first to specific sensations, and in the future to behaviors and cognitive tasks."" Church is Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, and Professor of Health Sciences and Technology at Harvard and MIT. To map neural connections, the consortium will genetically engineer mice so that each neuron is barcoded throughout its entire structure with a unique RNA sequence, a technique called BOINC (Barcoding of Individual Neuronal Connections) developed by Anthony Zador at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Thus a complete map representing the precise location, shape and connections of all neurons can be generated. The key to visualizing this complex map will be FISSEQ, which is able to sequence the total complement of barcodes and pinpoint their exact locations using a super-resolution microscope. Importantly, since FISSEQ analysis can be applied to intact brain tissue, the error-prone brain-sectioning procedure that is part of common mapping studies can be avoided and long neuronal processes can be more accurately traced in larger numbers and at a faster pace. In addition, the scientists will provide the barcoded mice with a sensory stimulus, such as a flash of light, to highlight and glean the circuits corresponding to that stimulus within the much more complex neuronal map. An improved understanding of how neuronal circuits are composed and how they function over longer distances will ultimately allow the team to build new models for machine learning. The multi-disciplinary consortium spans 6 institutions. In addition to Church, the Wyss Institute's effort will be led by Samuel Inverso, Ph.D., who is a Staff Software Engineer and Co-investigator of the project. Complementing the Wyss team, are co-Principal Investigators Anthony Zador, Ph.D., Alexei Koulakov, Ph.D., and Jay Lee, Ph.D., at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Adam Marblestone, Ph.D., and Liam Paninski, Ph.D. are co-Investigator at MIT and co-Principal Investigator at Columbia University, respectively. The Harvard-led consortium is partnering with another MICrONS team led by Tai Sing Lee, Ph.D. of Carnegie Mellon University as Principal investigator under a separate multi-million contract, with Sandra Kuhlman, Ph.D. of Carnegie Mellon University and Alan Yuille, Ph.D. of Johns Hopkins University as co-Principal investigators, to develop computational models of the neural circuits and a new generation of machine learning algorithms by studying the behaviors of a large population of neurons in behaving animals, as well as the circuitry of the these neurons revealed by the innovative methods developed by the consortium.

The methodology implemented by this research can change the trajectory of brain mapping worldwide,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children's Hospital and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/future-help-stroke-patients-language-problems-284001,Future help for stroke patients with language problems Brain researcher Karsten Specht has found a new method of analysis to distinguish between stroke patients with language problems  The result may be individualized treatment for each patient  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Brain researcher Karsten Specht has found a new method of analysis to distinguish between stroke patients with language problems. The result may be individualized treatment for each patient. The human language centre is located in the left hemisphere of the brain. Sometimes this area is damaged after a stroke. The consequence may be that the patient has difficulties in finding words or to understand language, aphasia. Today, patients are treated using general language training programs, based on symptoms. See Also: Righting a wrong? Right side of brain can compensate for post-stroke loss of speech ""Strokes strike individually. This is why it is vital to find the right treatment for each patient,"" says Professor Karsten Specht at the Department of Biological and Medical Psychology at the University of Bergen (UiB). Specht has recently studied a new method of analysis of brain imaging data, or more specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This new method may in the long run lead to a better way to categorise stroke patients and, hopefully, to a more individualized treatment in the future. Specht suggests that in ten years' time this new treatment could become generally available. Together with German colleagues, Specht published the article 'Therapy-induced brain reorganization patterns in aphasia' in the journal Brain. The article deals with a study, carried out in Germany, observing a group of stroke patients with language difficulties. They were all brain scanned using the fMRI technique as an important part of the analysis. An essential part of the research was done by the Bergen fMRI Group at UiB. Specht is the first to use so-called Joint Independent Component analysis on stroke patients, in which information about lesions in the brain are statistically combined with information about brain activity. The patients were scanned several times by an fMRI-machine, both before and during language training. During a multimodal analysis, the researchers studied how the networks of the brain were activated. The multimodal analysis involves analyzing MR scan images of the extent of the brain damage in stroke patients whilst studying brain activity using fMRI scans. ""Using this method, it is possible to find the localization of the damage, the size of the damage and how the activation patterns in the neural networks are related,"" Specht explains. In recent years it has been established that the adult brain retains its plasticity and is able to form new connections between neurons. Post stroke, if the brain is able to reactivate remaining communication networks or create new networks as a result of the therapy, the prognosis for the patient is much improved. The multimodal analysis makes it possible to observe if this is the case or not, and Specht's new method makes it possible to observes this, indirectly. ""The point is to track down active patterns that are characteristic for certain types of brain damage. It is then possible so separate the different types of strokes/patients. In the long run, we hope to point out the most effective treatment, based on these different sources of information,"" Specht says. Learn More: Brain s iconic seat of speech goes silent when we actually talk One example is Specht's observation that patients who suffered a stroke in the back of the left half and are able to activate remaining pathways of the language network may have a more optimistic prognosis than patients suffering a stroke in the front left half of the brain, who do not get this network reactivated after the stroke. To be able to separate different types of damage and the reorganization of the brain's language/linguistic network is crucial information for the health service. With current methods, according to Specht, this kind of combined information is hard to observe in individual patients. ""Until now researchers have analyzed the damaged area and brain activity in two separate operations. One almost has had to guess the extent of the damage,"" he says. ""This is why it is important to continue basic research to develop new and better integrative analytic tools, which in a longer perspective will provide us with better diagnosis and improved opportunities for therapy."" The current criteria for treatment is symptom-based rather than causal. If a stroke patient suffers language problems, he or she will often join a more general therapy program. ""A better diagnosis and status report means, hopefully, more individually adapted treatment in the future. You never find two patients with the same damage after a stroke,"" Karsten Specht says.

In humans, folding begins in fetal brains around the 20th week of gestation and is completed only when the child is about a year and a half. Why the brain is folded can be rationalized easily from an evolutionary perspective; folded brains likely evolved to fit a large cortex into a small volume with the benefit of reducing wiring length and improving cognitive function. See Also: Thickness of gray matter predicts ability to recognize faces and objects Less understood is how the brain folds. Several hypotheses have been proposed but none have been directly used to make testable predictions. Now, researchers at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences collaborating with scientists in Finland and France have shown that while many molecular processes are important in determining cellular events, what ultimately causes the brain to fold is a simple mechanical instability associated with buckling. The research is published in Nature Physics.Understanding how the brain folds is important as it sets the stage to unlocking the inner workings of the brain and unraveling brain-related disorders, as function often follows form.  We found that we could mimic cortical folding using a very simple physical principle and get results qualitatively similar to what we see in real fetal brains,  said L. Mahadevan, the Lola England de Valpine Professor of Applied Mathematics, Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, and Physics. The number, size, shape and position of neuronal cells during brain growth all lead to the  expansion of the gray matter, known as the cortex, relative to the underlying white matter. This puts the cortex under compression leading to a mechanical instability that causes it to crease locally.  This  simple evolutionary innovation, with iterations and variations, allows for the thin but expansive cortex to be packed into a small volume, and is the dominant cause behind brain folding, known as gyrification,  said Mahadevan, who is also a core faculty member of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, and member of the Kavli Institute for Bionano Science and Technology, at Harvard University. Mahadevan s previous research with former postdoctoral fellow Tuomas Tallinen and current postdoctoral fellow Jun Young Chung, co-first authors of the present article, found that the growth differential between the brain s outer cortex and the soft tissue underneath explains the variations in the folding patterns across organisms in terms of just two parameters, the relative size of the brain, and the relative expansion of the cortex. Building on this, the team collaborated with neuroanatomists and radiologists in France and directly tested this theory using data from human fetuses. The team made a three-dimensional, gel model of a smooth fetal brain based on MRI images. The model s surface was coated with a thin layer of elastomer gel, as an analog of the cortex. To mimic cortical expansion, the gel brain was immersed in a solvent that is absorbed by the outer layer  causing it to swell relative to the deeper regions. Within minutes of being immersed in liquid solvent, the resulting compression led to the formation of folds similar in size and shape to real brains. The extent of the similarities surprised even the researchers.  When I put the model into the solvent, I knew there should be folding but I never expected that kind of close pattern compared to human brain,  said Chung.  It looks like a real brain.  The key to those similarities lies in the unique shape of the human brain.  Learn More: Brain develops abnormally over lifespan of people who stutter  The geometry of the brain is really important because it serves to orient the folds in certain directions,  said Chung.  Our model, which has the same large scale geometry and curvature as a human brain, leads to the formation of folds that matches those seen in real fetal brains quite well.  The largest folds seen in the model gel brain are similar in shape, size and orientation to what is seen in the fetal brain, and can be replicated in multiple gel experiments.  The smallest folds are not conserved, mirroring similar variations across human brains.  Brains are not exactly the same from one human to another, but we should all have the same major folds in order to be healthy,  said Chung.  Our research shows that if a part of the brain does not grow properly,  or if the global geometry is disrupted, we may not have the major folds in the right place, which may cause potential dysfunction.

Spina bifida is a birth defect where there is incomplete closing of the backbone and the coverings around the spinal cord. The birth defect is associated with lifelong disability and death due to complications. In-utero surgery has been recently shown to improve the ability to walk and to reduce the need for shunting of hydrocephalus. However, over half of these children do not benefit from the in-utero repair. Researchers are trying to find a regenerative patch material for repair that would further reduce morbidity after repair through decreased damage to the spinal cord from inflammation and scar formation. This study sought to compare two patches that can be used in utero to repair the closing of the backbone with material that will promote regeneration of different coverings of spine. See Also: Scan may identify best candidates for fetal spina bifida surgery Although the study took place in a rat model of spina bifida, it provided promising results. The human umbilical cord patch was determined to promote cellular migration of epidermal, neuronal and endothelial cells with minimal inflammatory response compared to biocellulose film.

The new Northwestern Medicine study, published in Gene Therapy, provides evidence that lays a foundation for developing future gene replacement therapies to treat patients with the fatal neuromuscular disorder. See More: New approach for treating ALS: Re-evaluating old drugs Using a nontoxic virus injected directly into the motor cortex of mouse models with ALS, the scientists showed they can deliver new genes to damaged upper motor neurons. This process of transferring DNA from a virus to neurons is called transduction. To test the feasibility of transduction, the research team had the virus deliver a gene that expresses a green fluorescent protein - the color helped the scientists visualize how the neurons worked. Now that they know the transduction strategy is effective, they'll use it in future research to deliver genes that correct mutations in ALS cells. Importantly, the scientists were able to specifically modify the gene expression in diseased upper motor neurons without disturbing other neurons in the motor cortex. Inadvertently manipulating other cells could set off a cascade of unknown effects. ""The brain is very complex, with many different cells, but in ALS only a distinct neuron population shows initial vulnerability and undergoes progressive degeneration,"" said lead study author Hande Ozdinler, assistant professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""To develop effective treatment strategies, we must deliver genes only to the neurons in need. This is not easy to accomplish - previous studies have managed to induce a broad but non-specific transduction of many different neurons."" ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is marked by the deterioration of motor neurons, which causes muscle weakness and impaired speaking, swallowing and breathing, eventually leading to paralysis and death. In previous research, Ozdinler showed that defects in upper motor neurons (also known as corticospinal motor neurons), which send messages from the brain to the spinal cord to activate voluntary movement, may be a starting point for the disease. In the recent study, Ozdinler's team tested seven different strains of the adeno-associated virus. They found that a nontoxic strain called AAV2-2, already used in clinical studies for diseases such as Parkinson's, was able to deliver genes to damaged upper motor neurons at rates higher than ever seen before. Learn More: A step towards gene therapy against intractable epilepsy ""With just a one-time injection into the motor cortex, genes were very specifically delivered to the upper motor neurons,"" Ozdinler said. ""Among all cells transduced, about 70 percent were upper motor neurons. Without selectivity, this would be about 1 percent."" The investigators showed that the AAV2-2 virus transduced upper motor neurons in models of both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages of ALS, suggesting patients could eventually benefit from therapy based on this work even after they've started experiencing symptoms. ""This new study has very important clinical implications, especially for patients with familial ALS who display upper motor neuron defects,"" Ozdinler said. An upper motor neuron projects information to the spinal cord through its axon, a long, branch-like part of the cell that sends impulses to other cells. The fluorescent protein that was transferred to the neurons made this process visible. ""We saw that during ALS, damaged upper motor neurons stop talking to spinal neurons,"" Ozdinler said. ""In further research, we will examine how we can modulate gene expression to introduce correct versions of mutated genes and improve that connectivity and motor functions.""

The virus could help researchers map the intricacies of the brain and holds promise for the delivery of novel therapeutics to address diseases such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's. In addition, the screening approach the researchers developed to identify the virus could be used to make additional vectors capable of targeting cells in other organs. ""By figuring out a way to get genes across the blood-brain barrier, we are able to deliver them throughout the adult brain with high efficiency,"" says Ben Deverman, a senior research scientist at Caltech and lead author of a paper describing the work in the journal Nature Biotechnology. See Also: New knowledge about the BBB, the brain's effective bouncer The blood-brain barrier allows the body to keep pathogens and potentially harmful chemicals circulating in the blood from entering the brain and spinal cord. The semi-permeable blockade, composed of tightly packed cells, is crucial for maintaining a controlled environment to allow the central nervous system to function properly. However, the barrier also makes it nearly impossible for many drugs and other molecules to be delivered to the brain via the bloodstream. To sneak genes past the blood-brain barrier, the Caltech researchers used a new variant of a small, harmless virus called an adeno-associated virus (AAV). Over the past two decades, researchers have used various AAVs as vehicles to transport specific genes into the nuclei of cells; once there, the genes can be expressed, or translated, from DNA into proteins. In some applications, the AAVs carry functional copies of genes to replace mutated forms present in individuals with genetic diseases. In other applications, they are used to deliver genes that provide instructions for generating molecules such as antibodies or fluorescent proteins that help researchers study, identify, and track certain cells. Using a new selection method, Caltech researchers have evolved the protein shell of a harmless virus, AAV9, so that it can more efficiently cross the blood brain barrier and deliver genes, such as the GFP, to cells throughout the central nervous system. Here, GFP expression in naturally occurring AAV9 (left) can be seen distributed sparsely throughout the brain. The modified vector, AAV-PHP.B (right), provides more efficient GFP expression. Credit: Ben Deverman and the Gradinaru lab, Caltech  Largely because of the blood-brain barrier problem, scientists have had only limited success delivering AAVs and their genetic cargo to the central nervous system. In general, they have relied on surgical injections, which deliver high concentrations of the virus at the injection site but little to the outlying areas. Such injections are also quite invasive. ""One has to drill a hole through skull, then pierce tissue with a needle to the injection site,"" explains Viviana Gradinaru (BS '05), assistant professor of biology and biological engineering at Caltech and senior author on the paper. ""The deeper the injection, the higher the risk of hemorrhage. With systemic injection, using the bloodstream, none of that damage happens, and the delivery is more uniform."" In addition, Gradinaru notes, ""many disorders are not tightly localized. Neurodegenerative disorders like Huntington's disease affect very large brain areas. Also, many complex behaviors are mediated by distributed interacting networks. Our ability to target those networks is key in terms of our efforts to understand what those pathways are doing and how to improve them when they are not working well."" In 2009, a group led by Brian Kaspar of Ohio State University published a paper, also in Nature Biotechnology, showing that an AAV strain called AAV9 injected into the bloodstream could make its way into the brain--but it was only efficient when used in neonatal, or infant, mice. ""The big challenge was how do we achieve the same efficiency in an adult,"" says Gradinaru. Read More: New molecule found that sneaks medicines across the blood brain barrier Although one might like to design an AAV that is up to the task, the number of variables that dictate the behavior of any given virus, as well as the intricacies of the brain and its barrier, make that extremely challenging. Instead, the researchers developed a high-throughput selection assay, CREATE (Cre REcombinase-based AAV Targeted Evolution), that allowed them to test millions of viruses in vivo simultaneously and to identify those that were best at entering the brain and delivering genes to a specific class of brain cells, astrocytes. They started with the AAV9 virus and modified a gene fragment that codes for a small loop on the surface of the capsid the protein shell of the virus that envelops all of the virus' genetic material. Using a common amplification technique, known as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), they created millions of viral variants. Each variant carried within it the genetic instructions to produce more capsids like itself. Then they used their novel selection process to determine which variants most effectively delivered genes to astrocytes in the brain. Importantly, the new process relies on strategically positioning the gene encoding the capsid variants on the DNA strand between two short sequences of DNA, known as lox sites. These sites are recognized by an enzyme called Cre recombinase, which binds to them and inverts the genetic sequence between them. By injecting the modified viruses into transgenic mice that only express Cre recombinase in astrocytes, the researchers knew that any sequences flagged by the lox site inversion had successfully transferred their genetic cargo to the target cell type here, astrocytes. After one week, the researchers isolated DNA from brain and spinal cord tissue, and amplified the flagged sequences, thereby recovering only the variants that had entered astrocytes. Next, they took those sequences and inserted them back into the modified viral genome to create a new library that could be injected into the same type of transgenic mice. After only two such rounds of injection and amplification, a handful of variants emerged as those that were best at crossing the blood-brain barrier and entering astrocytes. ""We went from millions of viruses to a handful of testable, potentially useful hits that we could go through systematically and see which ones emerged with desirable properties,"" says Gradinaru. Through this selection process, the researchers identified a variant dubbed AAV-PHP.B as a top performer. They gave the virus its acronym in honor of the late Caltech biologist Paul H. Patterson because Deverman began this work in Patterson's group. ""Paul had a commitment to understanding brain disorders, and he saw the value in pushing tool development,"" says Gradinaru, who also worked in Patterson's lab as an undergraduate student. To test AAV-PHP.B, the researchers used it to deliver a gene that codes for a protein that glows green, making it easy to visualize which cells were expressing it. They injected the AAV-PHP.B or AAV9 (as a control) into different adult mice and after three weeks used the amount of green fluorescence to assess the efficacy with which the viruses entered the brain, the spinal cord, and the retina. ""We could see that AAV-PHP.B was expressed throughout the adult central nervous system with high efficiency in most cell types,"" says Gradinaru. Indeed, compared to AAV9, AAV-PHP.B delivers genes to the brain and spinal cord at least 40 times more efficiently. ""What provides most of AAV-PHP.B's benefit is its increased ability to get through the vasculature into the brain,"" says Deverman. ""Once there, many AAVs, including AAV9 are quite good at delivering genes to neurons and glia."" Gradinaru notes that since AAV-PHP.B is delivered through the bloodstream, it reaches other parts of the body. ""Although in this study we were focused on the brain, we were also able to use whole-body tissue clearing to look at its biodistribution throughout the body,"" she says. Whole-body tissue clearing by PARS CLARITY, a technique developed previously in the Gradinaru lab to make normally opaque mammalian tissues transparent, allows organs to be examined without the laborious task of making thin slide-mounted sections. Thus, tissue clearing allows researchers to more quickly screen the viral vectors for those that best target the cells and organs of interest. Learn More: Seeing the inner workings of the brain made easier by new technique ""In this case, the priority was to express the gene in the brain, but we can see by using whole-body clearing that you can actually have expression in many other organs and even in the peripheral nerves,"" explains Gradinaru. ""By making tissues transparent and looking through them, we can obtain more information about these viruses and identify targets that we might overlook otherwise."" The biologists conducted follow-up studies up to a year after the initial injections and found that the protein continued to be expressed efficiently. Such long-term expression is important for gene therapy studies in humans. In collaboration with colleagues from Stanford University, Deverman and Gradinaru also showed that AAV-PHP.B is better than AAV9 at delivering genes to human neurons and glia. The researchers hope to begin testing AAV-PHP.B's ability to deliver potentially therapeutic genes in disease models. They are also working to further evolve the virus to make even better performing variants and to produce variants that target certain cell types with more specificity. Deverman says that the CREATE system could indeed be applied to develop AAVs capable of delivering genes specifically to many different cell types. ""There are hundreds of different Cre transgenic lines available,"" he says. ""Researchers have put Cre recombinase under the control of gene regulatory elements so that it is only made in certain cell types. That means that regardless of whether your objective is to target liver cells or a particular type of neuron, you can almost always find a mouse that has Cre recombinase expressed in those cells."" ""The CREATE system gave us a good hit early on, but we are excited about the future potential of using this approach to generate viruses that have very good cell-type specificity in different organisms, especially the less genetically tractable ones,"" says Gradinaru. ""This is just the first step. We can take these tools and concepts in many exciting directions to further enhance this work, and we with the Beckman Institute and collaborators are ready to pursue those possibilities."" The Beckman Institute at Caltech recently opened a resource center called CLOVER (CLARITY, Optogenetics, and Vector Engineering Research Center) to support such research efforts involving tissue clearing and imaging, optogenetic studies, and custom gene-delivery vehicle development.

Most animal species, whether they rummage through a refrigerator or stalk prey in the wild, obtain nutrients by consuming living organisms. Plants, for the most part, adopt a different feeding, or  trophic,  strategy, making their own food through photosynthesis. There are, however, certain enterprising species that can do both: photosynthesize and consume prey. These organisms, found mostly in certain ocean plankton communities, live a flexible,  mixotrophic  lifestyle.  Now researchers at MIT and Bristol University in the United Kingdom have found that these microscopic, mixotrophic organisms may have a large impact on the ocean s food web and the global carbon cycle.  The scientists developed a mixotrophic model of the global ocean food web, at the scale of marine plankton, in which they gave each plankton class the ability to both photosynthesize and consume prey. They found that, compared with traditional models that do not take mixotrophs into account, their model produced larger, heavier plankton throughout the ocean. As these more substantial microbes die, the researchers found they increase the flux of sinking organic carbon particles by as much as 35 percent. The results, says Mick Follows, associate professor in MIT s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, suggest that mixotrophic organisms may make the ocean more efficient in storing carbon, which in turn enhances the efficiency with which the oceans sequester carbon dioxide.  If [mixotrophs] weren t in the oceans, we re suggesting atmospheric carbon dioxide might be higher, because there would less of the large, carbon-rich particles formed which efficiently transfer carbon to depth,  Follows says.  It s a hypothesis, but it has been ignored in carbon cycle models until now, and we suggest it must be represented because it s potentially very important.  Follows and his colleague Ben Ward, a former MIT postdoc now at Bristol University, have published their results today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Part of the equation Today s ocean models typically take an  either/or  approach, grouping plankton as either photosynthesizers or consumers of prey. This approach, Follows says, oversimplifies the processes taking place in the ocean that may ultimately contribute to how carbon moves through the oceans and atmosphere. He says mixotrophs are often overlooked, because our terrestrial experience makes them seem rare.   To us on land, we tend to think of [mixotrophs], like Venus fly traps, as exotic   they are a curiosity to us,  Follows says.  Our traditional perspective is biased by the land, where organisms fall into one or the other category, rather strictly. But in the oceans, the more people have looked at plankton, the more mixotrophy seems to be common.  The problem is that there are very few data to work into models, as it s extremely difficult to observe trophic strategies at the microscopic plankton scale. Therefore, models have largely left mixotrophs out of the equation and have instead looked to other marine processes to try and explain how much carbon is stored in the oceans.   It s like if we have a weather forecast model that gets the rain right in Boston today, but for the wrong reasons,  Follows says.  If we use it tomorrow, we shouldn t expect it to do a good job, because it was cooked up for today. We want our climate model to be representative of the processes going on, in order to be predictive of how carbon storage responds to global change.  Making a (mixotrophic) living As a first step, Follows and Ward chose to simulate a virtual world in which every plankton class is potentially mixotrophic.   It s a very idealized, black-and-white case: What s the maximum impact mixotrophs could have?  Follows says.  In the oceans, plankton can range in size from less than 1 micron, to about 1 millimeter in diameter. Typical ocean models that incorporate plankton often group them in 10 general size classes, each of which fall into a  two-guild  structure, as either photosynthesizers, or consumers of prey.  Instead, Follows and Ward made all of the plankton mixotrophic. The organisms in the model can photosynthesize, consuming inorganic nutrients. (The smallest organisms are the most efficient at acquiring those resources.) They can also eat other plankton and are constrained to consume prey in size classes about ten times smaller than themselves.  After we have built in these rules for the system, whether each size class lives largely by photosynthesis or largely by predation depends upon the availability of each type of resource and their relative ability to harvest them in each environment,  Follows says. After running the model forward, the researchers compared the results to those of a traditional model without mixotrophs. They found both models showed a general feeding structure throughout the plankton food web: The smallest organisms were too small to ingest prey, while the largest plankton were poor competitors when living by photosynthesis.  However, where the traditional model made a strict separation between those that photosynthesize and those that don t, the mixotrophic model blurred those lines, with some smaller organisms consuming prey and some larger ones being able to photosynthesize. The result was that mixotrophic organisms in every class increased the average size of that organism, creating larger and heavier plankton throughout the oceans. These more substantial organisms, compared to smaller and lighter plankton, were more capable of sinking to the ocean floor, as carbon-containing detritus.  It essentially means that, through multiple means, in a world with mixotrophs, more organic carbon is sinking into the deep ocean than in a world without mixotrophs,  Follows says.  The team s estimate of the amount of sinking carbon contributed by mixotrophs appears to agree with recent observations of carbon flux by mixotrophic plankton in the North Atlantic. Follows says that, with more data on these opportunistic organisms, he hopes to improve the model to accurately reflect mixotrophic populations and their effect on the planet s carbon cycle.  Part of our hope is for the work is to give some wind to the sails of these observational studies. We think they re very valuable,  Follows says.  There may be a large fraction of grazing that is being done by mixotrophs, so it s potentially very significant in terms of the flow of carbon in the ocean and it should be quantified.  This research was funded, in part, by the Simons Foundation, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, NASA, and the National Science Foundation.","Published: February 2, 2016"

It is notoriously difficult to diagnose as it has many symptoms but not all sufferers experience all of them and the disease can progress at different rates. MRI scans have been used as a diagnostic tool to detect white matter lesions in the brain but these are not always an indicator of the disease. Now a research team at the University of Nottingham has found a way to use clinical MRI to distinguish between MS lesions and other brain white spots which are found in MS. The study is published in the Multiple Sclerosis Journal. See Also: Pathological progression of multiple sclerosis documented for the first time They have used a clinical MRI scanner of the type all neuroscience centers have to carry out a special type of scan called a T2-weighted imaging process which is able to reveal lesions in the brain's white matter that are centered on a vein a known indicator of MS. Leading the work, Dr Nikos Evangelou, said: ""We already knew that large research MRI scanners could detect the proportion of lesions with a vein in the brain's white matter, but these scanners are not clinically available. So we wanted to find out whether a single brain scan in an NHS hospital scanner could also be effective in distinguishing between patients known to have MS and patients known to have non-MS brain lesions. We are excited to reveal that our results show that clinical application of this technique could supplement existing diagnostic methods for MS."" A total of 40 patients were recruited from the neurology outpatients' department of Nottingham University Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Trust. Initially a test cohort of 10 patients with MS and 10 patients with non-MS white brain matter lesions were scanned. Anonymized scans were analysed blinded to clinical data and simple diagnostic rules were devised. The same rules were applied to a validation cohort of 20 patients (13 with MS and 7 with other lesions) by a blinded observer. Learn More: Study of self-awareness in multiple sclerosis has implications for rehabilitation Within the test cohort, all patients with MS had central veins in more than 45 per cent of brain lesions, while the rest had central veins visible in less than 45 per cent of lesions. Then, by applying the same diagnostic rules to the second cohort, all the remaining patients were correctly categorised into MS or non-MS, by the blinded observer, taking less than two minutes per scan. The new study is significant because currently among patients referred to MS treatment centers with suspected MS, fewer than 50 per cent are found to have it. This shows that diagnosing MS in a significant minority of cases can be challenging. The Nottingham University team has now started a new study examining patients with real uncertainty about the diagnosis and aim to extend the study in other UK towns so more patients can participate in this important research. It is possible that in less than two years we will know if this new test is accurate as it appears to be. In that case, the way we will be diagnosing MS will probably be quicker and more reliable.

Autism, a highly heritable neurodevelopment disorder that causes difficulties with social interactions, has been postulated to be caused by neuron overgrowth in the prenatal period, although the precise timing and cause of this overgrowth has been unknown.  Researchers at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) School of Medicine and other institutions have recently uncovered abnormalities in embryonic brain development in mice, including transient embryonic brain enlargement during neuron formation, that are responsible for abnormal adult brain structures and behavioral abnormalities. These findings demonstrate a fetal origin for social and repetitive behavior deficits, as seen in disorders such as autism. See Also: Researchers observe brain development in utero Using engineered mice, the researchers identified a critical period during embryonic brain development for the establishment of normal social behavior and were able to link this critical period with abnormalities in specific adult brain structures. After identifying these abnormalities, the researchers were then able to intervene and treat mice during fetal development. The embryonically treated mice progressed without adult behavioral deficits. Further studies will be required to determine the consequences of abnormal development of cortical neurons on adult brain circuitry and function, as well as possible therapeutic interventions. The results of the study were published in the current issue of Molecular Psychiatry.  It is likely that abnormal brain development can cause long term alterations in brain circuitry that may later manifest as behavioral affective disorders in adults. By defining the pathway that connects embryonic development to adult social conditions, we were able to target the pathway in the embryo and provide a potential approach to stop the later development of abnormal behaviors. In the mice we treated, we were able to reverse the embryonic deficits that appear to lead to social and repetitive behavior disorders,  said Anthony Wynshaw-Boris, MD, PhD, Chair, Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and University Hospitals Case Medical Center. The work was initiated when he was a professor in the Department of Pediatrics at UCSF School of Medicine.  We examined brains from the mouse embryos that developed social and repetitive behavioral abnormalities as adults since a number of children that develop autism display larger brains sooner after birth than typically developing children,  said Haim Belinson, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Wynshaw-Boris laboratory and first author of the Molecular Psychiatry paper.  We believe these findings may be relevant to the development of autism, and we are currently investigating this further.  Case Western Reserve University  press release Belinson H et al.

Their work, published in the Jan. 29 issue of Science, could change the way scientists understand melanoma and other cancers and lead to new, early treatments before the cancer has taken hold.  An important mystery has been why some cells in the body already have mutations seen in cancer, but do not yet fully behave like the cancer,  says the paper s first author, Charles Kaufman, a postdoctoral fellow in the Zon Laboratory at Boston Children s Hospital.  We found that the beginning of cancer occurs after activation of an oncogene or loss of a tumor suppressor, and involves a change that takes a single cell back to a stem cell state.  That change, Kaufman and colleagues found, involves a set of genes that could be targeted to stop cancer from ever starting. The study imaged live zebrafish over time to track the development of melanoma. All the fish had the human cancer mutation BRAFV600E   found in most benign moles   and had also lost the tumor suppressor gene p53. Cancer from the beginning Kaufman and colleagues engineered the fish to light up in fluorescent green if a gene called crestin was turned on   a  beacon  indicating activation of a genetic program characteristic of stem cells. This program normally shuts off after embryonic development, but occasionally, in certain cells and for reasons not yet known, crestin and other genes in the program turn back on.  Every so often we would see a green spot on a fish,  said Leonard Zon, director of the Stem Cell Research Program at Boston Children s and senior investigator on the study.  When we followed them, they became tumors 100 percent of the time.  The cell that caused melanoma When Kaufman, Zon, and colleagues looked to see what was different about these early cancer cells, they found that crestin and the other activated genes were the same ones turned on during zebrafish embryonic development   specifically, in the stem cells that give rise to the pigment cells known as melanocytes, within a structure called the neural crest.  What s cool about this group of genes is that they also get turned on in human melanoma,  said Zon, who is also a member of the Harvard Stem Cell Instituteand a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.  It s a change in cell fate, back to neural crest status.  Finding these cancer-originating cells was tedious. Wearing goggles and using a microscope with a fluorescent filter, Kaufman examined the fish as they swam around, shooting video with his iPhone. Scanning 50 fish could take two to three hours. In 30 fish, Kaufman spotted a small cluster of green-glowing cells about the size of the head of a Sharpie marker   and in all 30 cases, these spots grew into melanomas. In two cases, he was able to see on a single green-glowing cell and watch it divide and ultimately become a tumor mass.  It s estimated that only one in tens or hundreds of millions of cells in a mole eventually becomes a melanoma,  says Kaufman, who is also an instructor at the Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.  Because we can also efficiently breed many fish, we can look for these very rare events. The rarity is very similar in both humans and fish, which suggests that the underlying process of melanoma formation is probably much the same in humans.  Zon, the Grousbeck Professor of Pediatric Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Kaufman believe that their findings could lead to a new genetic test for suspicious moles to see whether the cells are behaving like neural crest cells, indicating that the stem-cell program has been turned on. They are also investigating the regulatory elements that turn on the genetic program (known as super-enhancers). These DNA elements have epigenetic functions that are similar in zebrafish and human melanoma, and could potentially be targeted with drugs to stop a mole from becoming cancerous. A paradigm shift for cancer? Zon and Kaufman posit a new model for cancer formation, going back to a decades-old concept of  field cancerization.  They propose that normal tissue becomes primed for cancer when oncogenes are activated and tumor suppressor genes are silenced or lost, but that cancer develops only when a cell in the tissue reverts to a more primitive, embryonic state and starts dividing. They believe this model may apply to most if not all cancers, not just melanoma.","Published: February 1, 2016"

The HIV protein transactivator of transcription (Tat) is an important contributor to HIV neuropathogenesis because it is a potent neurotoxin that continues to be produced despite treatment with antiretroviral therapy. Researchers at the University of Minnesota found that Tat altered the activity of networked neurons and that the network adapted to the presence of the toxin. The authors report that Tat alters the excitability of networked neurons by a process that required binding to cell surface proteins. Lead author Kelly Krogh, Ph.D., now a research fellow at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, suggests that ""the most notable discovery from this study is that the activity of the networked neurons adapted in the sustained presence of the HIV protein."" Senior author Professor Stanley Thayer, Ph.D., speculates that ""the adaptations may improve survival at a cost of impaired network function. Perhaps some of the deficits caused by HIV in the brain result from coping mechanisms gone awry."" Infection with HIV is associated with increased incidence of new-onset seizures in a significant percentage of patients, however the specific cause of seizure disorders remains unknown. Doctoral student Mathew Green cautions ""that the electrical changes recorded in vitro may not correspond to EEG changes in HIV+ patients, but this work does establish the principle that networks of neurons adapt to the presence of a toxic HIV protein and suggest that viewing EEG changes as an adaptive response might facilitate therapeutic intervention.""

Having an atomic-resolution structure and a better understanding of this mechanism gives us the ability to someday design therapeutics to combat cancer and neurodegeneration,  said TSRI biologist Gabriel Lander, who was co-senior of author of the study with Andreas Martin of UC Berkeley. Keeping Cells Healthy The new study sheds light on the proteasome, a molecular machine that serves as a recycling center in cells. Proteasomes break down spent or damaged proteins and can even eliminate harmful misfolded proteins observed in many diseases. The new research is the first study in almost 20 years to solve a large component of the proteasome at near-atomic resolution. Lander said the breakthrough was possible with recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (EM), an imaging technique in which a sample is bombarded with an electron beam, producing hundreds of thousands of protein images that can be consolidated into a high-resolution structure. Using cryo-EM, scientists investigated part of the proteasome that contains a deubiquitinase enzyme called Rpn11. Rpn11 performs a crucial function called deubiquitination, during which it cleaves molecular tags from proteins scheduled for recycling in the proteasome. This is a key step in proteasomal processing without Rpn11, the protein tags would clog the proteasome and the cell would die. From previous studies, scientists knew Rpn11 and its surrounding proteins latch onto the proteasome to form a sort of lid.  The lid complex wraps around the proteasome like a face-hugger in the movie  Alien,  said Lander. The lid complex can also exist separately from the proteasome which poses a potential problem. If Rpn11 cleaves tags from proteins that haven t gotten to the proteasome yet, those proteins could skip the recycling stage and cause disease. Scientists had wondered how nature had solved this problem. A Guide for Future Therapies The study provides an answer, showing the lid complex as it floats freely in cells. In this conformation, Rpn11 is carefully nestled in the crook of surrounding proteins, stabilized and inactive.  There's a sophisticated network of interactions that pin the Rpn11 deubiquitinase against neighboring subunits to keep it inhibited in the isolated proteasome lid,  explained Corey M. Dambacher, a researcher at TSRI at the time of the study and now a senior scientist at Omniome, Inc., who was first author of the study with TSRI Research Associate Mark Herzik Jr. and Evan J. Worden of UC Berkeley.  In order for Rpn11 to perform its job, it has to flip out of this inhibited conformation,  said Herzik. The new study also shows that, to flip out of the conformation at the proteasome, the proteins surrounding deubiquitinase pivot and rotate binding to the proteasome and releasing the deubiquitinase active site from its nook. Lander called the system  finely tuned,  but said there may be ways to manipulate it. The study collaborators at UC Berkeley made small mutations to the proteins holding Rpn11 in position, and found that any small change will release the deubiquitinase, even when the lid is floating freely. Lander said the new understanding of the mechanism that activates Rpn11 could guide future therapies that remove damaged or misfolded proteins.  Accumulation of these toxic proteins can lead to diseases such as Parkinson s and Alzheimer s, as well as a variety of cancers,  Lander said.  If we can harness the proteasome s ability to remove specific proteins from the cell, this gives us incredible power over cellular function and improves our ability to target certain cells for destruction.  Going forward, the researchers hope to use the same cryo-EM techniques to investigate other components of the proteasome and figure out exactly how it recognizes and destroys proteins.  There s still a lot to learn,  said Lander.","Published: February 1, 2016"

The genes identified are also an avenue for understanding the biology of the lithium response. People with bipolar disorder experience marked, often extreme shifts in mood and energy. The disorder affects an estimated 2.6 percent of Americans. The mood swings can severely disrupt a person s ability to function normally; as many as 15 percent of those affected die by suicide. Lithium is a mood stabilizing medication that is a mainstay of treatment. For some patients, it is very effective, virtually eliminating the symptoms. However, about a third of patients respond incompletely, and another third not at all. NIMH scientist Francis J. McMahon, M.D., and Thomas G. Schulze, M.D., a former NIMH fellow now at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Germany, led a collaboration involving 22 sites participating in the International Consortium on Lithium Genetics to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2563 patients with bipolar disorder. Like all psychiatric disorders, bipolar disorder is genetically complex; it is likely that many genes, with small effects individually, influence the risk of developing it. In addition, risk genes interact with environmental factors to cause the disorder, making the search for risk genes that much more difficult. These challenges mean that large numbers of patients are necessary to enable scientists to detect associations between gene regions and biological effects. Scientists in this study scanned genomes of participating patients, testing whether any of 6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), pinpoint variations in DNA across the genome, were associated with a person s response to lithium. Four SNPs in a single location on chromosome 21 met criteria for association. The region identified contains two genes for long, non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). In addition to RNA s role as an intermediary in the translation of genes into proteins, it is now known to have a broader variety of biologic roles, including regulating such functions as gene expression and other cell processes. The identification of these lncRNAs offers scientists targets with which to explore how these molecules shape how someone responds to lithium. While the patient population in this study was larger than any previous focused on the genetics of the lithium response, like other GWAS studies, this one depended on patients  recall of their treatment experience. In an effort to test these results in a way that would avoid the uncertainties of recall, the scientific team also looked for these SNPs in a separate, smaller group of (89) patients who were being treated with lithium and assessed prospectively, or as their treatment continued. The SNPs were indeed associated with poorer lithium response, adding confidence to the original finding. The need for  biomarkers  of lithium response and for treatment effectiveness over the range of psychiatric disorders is great. For genetic information to be useful in the clinic for guiding treatment choices for individuals, it may be necessary to have information on a large number of genes in addition to other types of information on individuals. The identification of genetic markers is one facet of the effort to move health care towards precision medicine , an approach in which disease treatment and prevention takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle. The results reported here will require replication, but this study suggests that ongoing research can provide information on genes that will be of use in health care, even for disorders in which the genetics are complex, and the effects of individual genes subtle.","Published: February 1, 2016"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/therapy-halts-progression-of-lou-gehrigs-disease-211689,Therapy Halts Progression of Lou Gehrig s Disease Researchers at Oregon State University announced today that they have essentially stopped the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  ALS   or Lou Gehrig s disease  for nearly two years in one type of mouse model used to study the disease   allowing the mice to approach their normal lifespan  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The findings, scientists indicate, are some of the most compelling ever produced in the search for a therapy for ALS, a debilitating and fatal disease.  We are shocked at how well this treatment can stop the progression of ALS,  said Joseph Beckman, lead author on this study, a distinguished professor of biochemistry and biophysics in the College of Science at Oregon State University, and principal investigator and holder of the Burgess and Elizabeth Jamieson Chair in OSU s Linus Pauling Institute. In decades of work, no treatment has been discovered for ALS that can do anything but prolong human survival less than a month. The mouse model used in this study is one that scientists believe may more closely resemble the human reaction to this treatment, which consists of a compound called copper-ATSM. It s not yet known if humans will have the same response, but researchers are moving as quickly as possible toward human clinical trials, testing first for safety and then efficacy of the new approach. ALS was identified as a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease in the late 1800s, and gained international recognition in 1939 when it was diagnosed in American baseball legend Lou Gehrig. It s known to be caused by the death and deterioration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, which in turn has been linked to mutations in copper, zinc superoxide dismutase. Copper-ATSM is a known compound that helps deliver copper specifically to cells with damaged mitochondria, and reaches the spinal cord where it s needed to treat ALS. This compound has low toxicity, easily penetrates the blood-brain barrier, is already used in human medicine at much lower doses for some purposes, and is well tolerated in laboratory animals at far higher levels. Any copper not needed after use of copper-ATSM is quickly flushed out of the body. Experts caution, however, that this approach is not as simple as taking a nutritional supplement of copper, which can be toxic at even moderate doses. Such supplements would be of no value to people with ALS, they said. The new findings were reported by scientists from OSU; the University of Melbourne in Australia; University of Texas Southwestern; University of Central Florida; and the Pasteur Institute of Montevideo in Uruguay. The study is available as open access in Neurobiology of Disease. Using the new treatment, researchers were able to stop the progression of ALS in one type of transgenic mouse model, which ordinarily would die within two weeks without treatment. Some of these mice have survived for more than 650 days, 500 days longer than any previous research has been able to achieve. In some experiments, the treatment was begun, and then withheld. In this circumstance the mice began to show ALS symptoms within two months after treatment was stopped, and would die within another month. But if treatment was resumed, the mice gained weight, progression of the disease once again was stopped, and the mice lived another 6-12 months. In 2012, Beckman was recognized as the leading medical researcher in Oregon, with the Discovery Award from the Medical Research Foundation of Oregon. He is also director of OSU s Environmental Health Sciences Center, funded by the National Institutes of Health to support research on the role of the environment in causing disease.  We have a solid understanding of why the treatment works in the mice, and we predict it should work in both familial and possibly sporadic human patients,  Beckman said.  But we won t know until we try.  Familial ALS patients are those with more of a family history of the disease, while sporadic patients reflect the larger general population.  We want people to understand that we are moving to human trials as quickly as we can,  Beckman said.  In humans who develop ALS, the average time from onset to death is only three to four years.  The advances are based on substantial scientific progress in understanding the disease processes of ALS and basic research in biochemistry. The transgenic mice used in these studies have been engineered to carry the human gene for  copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase,  or CCS gene. CCS inserts copper into superoxide dismustase, or SOD, and transgenic mice carrying these human genes die rapidly without treatment. After years of research, scientists have developed an approach to treating ALS that s based on bringing copper into specific cells in the spinal cord and mitochondria weakened by copper deficiency. Copper is a metal that helps to stabilize SOD, an antioxidant protein whose proper function is essential to life. But when it lacks its metal co-factors, SOD can  unfold  and become toxic, leading to the death of motor neurons. There s some evidence that this approach, which works in part by improving mitochondrial function, may also have value in Parkinson s disease and other conditions, researchers said. Research is progressing on those topics as well.  The treatment is unlikely to allow significant recovery from neuronal loss already caused by ALS, the scientists said, but could slow further disease progression when started after diagnosis. It could also potentially treat carriers of SOD mutant genes that cause ALS.","Published: February 1, 2016"

Understanding and characterizing any NGS assay for liquid biopsy samples will require well-defined reference reagents. Standards like Seraseq ctDNA reference material allow the community to first understand ctDNA properties, optimize assays and then ultimately use ctDNA in innovative assays to detect and monitor cancer burdens within samples. In turn, this type of work will lay the foundation for transforming future cancer treatments. ","Published: February 1, 2016"

Modern plant breeders wait weeks or months, not centuries, to discover what the literal fruits of their labors might be; now, a study led at Illinois and supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has explored the strengths of a molecular method that reduces this wait time to a few days. The new study addresses a central challenge of transgenic plant development: how to reliably evaluate whether genetic material has been successfully introduced. Researchers at the University of Illinois, the Polish Academy of Sciences, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the University of California, Berkeley compared the traditional method to several new ones that have emerged from advances in genomic technology and identified one that is much faster than the standard approach, yet equally reliable. The study was led by Illinois postdoctoral fellows Kasia Glowacka and Johannes Kromdijk.  For plants with long life cycles, such as our food crops, this will greatly speed the time between genetic transformation or DNA editing, and development of pure breeding lines,  said Long, Gutgsell Endowed Professor of Crop Sciences and Plant Biology and the principal investigator for the study. Long is also a member of the Genomic Ecology of Global Change and Biosystems Design research themes and the Energy Biosciences Institute at the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology. To meet the food and fuel needs of an ever-growing global population, researchers benefit from transgenic technologies to develop crops with higher yields and greater resiliency to environmental challenges. None of the technologies used to introduce new genetic material into plants work with 100 percent efficiency. Plants and their offspring must be screened to identify those in which gene transfer was successful. Traditionally, this was done in part by testing successive generations of plants to see if the desired traits are present and breed true over time. In addition, plant scientists can use one of several molecular methods to determine if a gene or genes have actually been successfully introduced into the plant genome. The  tried and true  method, the Southern blot, yields precise data but is slow and unwieldy. It requires isolating relatively large amounts of plant DNA, using fluorescent or radioactive dye to detect the gene of interest, and performing a week s worth of lab work for results from just a few samples at a time. The team compared the Southern blot technique with several that use variations of a chemical process called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This process allows researchers to quantify specific pieces of the introduced DNA sequences by making many additional copies of them, and then estimating the number of copies somewhat like estimating the amount of bacteria present in a sample by spreading it on a petri dish and letting colonies grow until they are visible. These methods are much faster than Southern blotting, but if the DNA in each sample does not  grow  at exactly the same rate, the resulting data will be imprecise size won t be a perfect indicator of the starting quantity. One method examined by Long s group, digital drop PCR (ddPCR), is designed to overcome this weakness. Rather than using the PCR process to amplify all the DNA in a sample, this method first separates each individual fragment of DNA into its own tiny reaction, much like giving each bacterium its own tiny petri dish to grow in. PCR then amplifies each fragment until there are enough copies to be easily detected, and the total number of tiny reactions are counted. Because this method, unlike others, separates the growth-like step from the quantification step, it can be very precise even when the reaction isn t perfect. Results can be obtained in less than two days, and many samples can be processed simultaneously. Long hopes that his group s demonstration that ddPCR is a  reliable, fast and high throughput  technique will help it to become the new standard for those developing transgenic crops.  I believe it will become widely adopted,  he said. Although ddPCR is currently more expensive than the other methods, Long said the cost would likely drop quickly, as have the costs of other genomic technologies.","Published: February 1, 2016"

The Phase 2a study (PEPIX) was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study, designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of orally administered IX-01 at doses of 400mg and 800mg, taken as required prior to sexual intercourse, in 88 patients with severe lifelong PE in the U.S and Australia. The study demonstrated that patients receiving IX-01 clinically and statistically significantly (P<0.01) improved their intra vaginal ejaculatory latency times (IELT) by more than 3.5 fold compared to those patients receiving placebo. Patients receiving IX-01 also reported statistically significantly greater improvements in their feelings of control (P <0.05) and distress (P <0.05) compared to patients receiving placebo. In addition, the proportion of patients rating their PE as slightly better, better or much better, as determined by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), was statistically significantly greater for IX-01 compared to placebo (P <0.01). The drug was also shown to be extremely well tolerated with a safety and adverse event profile similar to that seen for placebo. Gary Muirhead, Chief Executive Officer of Ixchelsis, commented:  We are delighted to have achieved clinical proof of concept for IX-01. We are particularly pleased that we have demonstrated significant efficacy together with a very benign safety and toleration profile in patients suffering from the most severe lifelong PE. We are now progressing into a Phase 2b dose ranging study to fully evaluate the dose response relationship. We believe that, based on these data and the current lack of safe and effective treatments, IX-01 has the potential to be a blockbuster treatment for PE.  Dr Chris McMahon, Director of the Australian Centre for Sexual Health in Sydney, Australia and the Principal Investigator for the study, said  These results are very exciting, we had hypothesised that a centrally acting oxytocin receptor antagonist should be effective in treating PE and these clinical data confirm that hypothesis. The treatment options for PE are extremely limited and IX-01 offers the potential to be first-line pharmacological treatment for men with this common and distressing condition.  The proof of concept study was conducted by New England Research Institutes, an independent contract research organization in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dr. Raymond Rosen, Chief Scientist of New England Research Institutes and international thought leader in sexual medicine, commented:  Along with its unique mechanism of action, IX-01 has an excellent profile of efficacy and tolerability.

In a pair of new studies, scientists from the Gladstone Institutes have discovered a specific neural circuit that controls walking, and they found that input to this circuit is disrupted in Parkinson s disease. Walking becomes a major challenge for people afflicted by Parkinson s disease. Parkinson s is caused by a depletion of dopamine in the basal ganglia (BG), a brain region involved in fundamental behaviors like movement, learning, reward, and motivation. In Parkinson s, an imbalance arises between two pathways in the BG: the direct or  go  pathway and the indirect or  stop  pathway. Ordinarily, these pathways work together seamlessly to control locomotion, but in Parkinson s the stop pathway overpowers the go pathway, making it difficult to initiate movement. How the imbalance between these two pathways developed remained a mystery until now. Published in Neuron, scientists led by Gladstone associate investigator Anatol Kreitzer, PhD, discovered that dopamine depletion causes a miscommunication between the BG and the thalamus, an area thought to relay sensory information to the brain. This miscommunication results in a loss of input to the go pathway from the thalamus, which consequently disrupts movement. Blocking the connection between the two regions reversed the imbalance between the stop and go pathways and restored normal behavior in a mouse model of Parkinson s.  This study provides strong evidence for a mechanism by which the stop pathway overcomes the go pathway in Parkinson s disease,  says first author Philip Parker, PhD, a former graduate student in Dr. Kreitzer s lab at the Gladstone Institutes and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).  Our findings implicate the thalamus in the development of the disease, an area of the brain that has received relatively little attention in Parkinson s research.   Several studies have targeted the thalamus with deep brain stimulation to treat Parkinson s, but the region s role in the disease was not well established,  adds Dr. Kreitzer, who is also an associate professor of physiology and neurology at UCSF.  Our findings finally provide a clear picture of how the thalamus can imbalance neural circuits and suppress movement in this condition.  In the second study, published in Cell, the scientists discovered that the go and stop pathways from the BG control locomotion by regulating a group of nerve cells in the brainstem that connects the brain to the spinal cord. The researchers revealed that the go pathway selectively activates a type of neuron in the brainstem that releases the neurochemical glutamate, and these neurons are responsible for triggering locomotion. The scientists used optogenetics to stimulate either the go or the stop pathway in mice that were running on a tiny treadmill, while recording neural activity in the brainstem. They discovered that the go pathway selectively activated glutamate neurons, causing the mice to move, whereas the stop pathway inhibited these neurons and made the mice stop.  This is the first time we have been able to demonstrate how the go and stop pathways regulate locomotion,  says Tom Roseberry, a graduate student in the lab of Dr. Kreitzer.  We show a very precise connection from the basal ganglia to the brainstem that controls movement.  Remarkably, the researchers discovered that the brainstem neurons can overpower the signals from the BG that is, if glutamate neurons were turned on, the animal moved even if the stop pathway is activated.  In order to understand why walking is particularly disrupted in Parkinson s disease, we need to map out the circuitry that controls walking,  says Dr. Kreitzer.  Our study shows that a specific set of neurons in the brainstem are both necessary and sufficient to initiate locomotion. This finding could open the door for new treatment targets to help Parkinson s patients walk more easily.  Gladstones Institutes  Original reporting by: Dana G. SmithRoseberry TK et al.

The findings, scientists indicate, are some of the most compelling ever produced in the search for a therapy for ALS, a debilitating and fatal disease, and are published in Neurobiology of Disease. See Also: New approach for treating ALS: Re-evaluating old drugs ""We are shocked at how well this treatment can stop the progression of ALS,"" said Joseph Beckman, lead author on this study, a distinguished professor of biochemistry and biophysics in the College of Science at Oregon State University, and principal investigator and holder of the Burgess and Elizabeth Jamieson Chair in OSU's Linus Pauling Institute. In decades of work, no treatment has been discovered for ALS that can do anything but prolong human survival less than a month. The mouse model used in this study is one that scientists believe may more closely resemble the human reaction to this treatment, which consists of a compound called copper-ATSM. It's not yet known if humans will have the same response, but researchers are moving as quickly as possible toward human clinical trials, testing first for safety and then efficacy of the new approach. ALS was identified as a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease in the late 1800s, and gained international recognition in 1939 when it was diagnosed in American baseball legend Lou Gehrig. It's known to be caused by the death and deterioration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, which in turn has been linked to mutations in copper, zinc superoxide dismutase. Copper-ATSM is a known compound that helps deliver copper specifically to cells with damaged mitochondria, and reaches the spinal cord where it's needed to treat ALS. This compound has low toxicity, easily penetrates the blood-brain barrier, is already used in human medicine at much lower doses for some purposes, and is well tolerated in laboratory animals at far higher levels. Any copper not needed after use of copper-ATSM is quickly flushed out of the body. Experts caution, however, that this approach is not as simple as taking a nutritional supplement of copper, which can be toxic at even moderate doses. Such supplements would be of no value to people with ALS, they said. Using the new treatment, researchers were able to stop the progression of ALS in one type of transgenic mouse model, which ordinarily would die within two weeks without treatment. Some of these mice have survived for more than 650 days, 500 days longer than any previous research has been able to achieve. In some experiments, the treatment was begun, and then withheld. In this circumstance the mice began to show ALS symptoms within two months after treatment was stopped, and would die within another month. But if treatment was resumed, the mice gained weight, progression of the disease once again was stopped, and the mice lived another 6-12 months. In 2012, Beckman was recognized as the leading medical researcher in Oregon, with the Discovery Award from the Medical Research Foundation of Oregon. He is also director of OSU's Environmental Health Sciences Center, funded by the National Institutes of Health to support research on the role of the environment in causing disease. ""We have a solid understanding of why the treatment works in the mice, and we predict it should work in both familial and possibly sporadic human patients,"" Beckman said. ""But we won't know until we try."" Familial ALS patients are those with more of a family history of the disease, while sporadic patients reflect the larger general population. Learn More: Study uncovers key differences among ALS patients ""We want people to understand that we are moving to human trials as quickly as we can,"" Beckman said. ""In humans who develop ALS, the average time from onset to death is only three to four years."" The advances are based on substantial scientific progress in understanding the disease processes of ALS and basic research in biochemistry. The transgenic mice used in these studies have been engineered to carry the human gene for ""copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase,"" or CCS gene. CCS inserts copper into superoxide dismustase, or SOD, and transgenic mice carrying these human genes die rapidly without treatment. After years of research, scientists have developed an approach to treating ALS that's based on bringing copper into specific cells in the spinal cord and mitochondria weakened by copper deficiency. Copper is a metal that helps to stabilize SOD, an antioxidant protein whose proper function is essential to life. But when it lacks its metal co-factors, SOD can ""unfold"" and become toxic, leading to the death of motor neurons. There's some evidence that this approach, which works in part by improving mitochondrial function, may also have value in Parkinson's disease and other conditions, researchers said. Research is progressing on those topics as well. The treatment is unlikely to allow significant recovery from neuronal loss already caused by ALS, the scientists said, but could slow further disease progression when started after diagnosis. It could also potentially treat carriers of SOD mutant genes that cause ALS. Oregon State University  press release William JR et al.

Unfortunately, such surgeries often fail to bring any relief. The ability to reliably pinpoint the anatomical source of seizures, different for each patient, remains elusive.  Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania s School of Engineering and Applied Science and Perelman School of Medicine are looking for ways to refine this process by looking at networks of electrical activity in the brain just prior to the onset of a seizure. See Also: Important clue to potential treatments for absence seizures found Using brain data crowdsourced from 22 epilepsy patients with implanted electrodes, the researchers have developed a series of algorithms that can predict where in the brain a seizure will originate and which groups of neurons it will likely spread to as it grows. Such algorithms could provide a more objective way of identifying surgical targets, improving the success rate of such interventions. And because the data also provide for a generalizable model of how seizures evolve and spread through neural networks, they could also inform less invasive forms of treatments. An implantable device, for example, could monitor these warning signs and automatically deliver precise electrical impulses that would neutralize the seizure before it manifests. The research was led by Danielle Bassett, the Skirkanich Assistant Professor of Innovation in Penn Engineering; Brian Litt, a professor of Neurology in Penn s Perelman School of Medicine and of Bioengineering in Penn Engineering; and Ankit Khambhati, a graduate student in the Litt Lab. It was published in the journal PLOS Computational Biology.  By mapping the network of activity in the brain and how it changes over time,  Bassett said,  we aim to quantify the reconfiguration of this network that leads to different stages of a seizure.   Using the novel algorithms we ve generated to parse seizures into different states,  Khambhati said,  we can answer questions such as,  In which state is the seizure beginning?,  and  In which state does it begin to spread?  At the core of the research team s findings is the International Epilepsy Electrophysiology Portal, founded by Litt; Zachary Ives, a professor and Markowitz Faculty Fellow in Penn Engineering s Department of Computer & Information Science; and Gregory Worrell, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic. It was designed to collect direct brain recordings from epilepsy patients the world over. Each patient in the study has between 80 and 100 electrodes implanted in regions of the brain that preliminary tests suggested were the sources of seizures. The electrodes indirectly record the voltage of brain activity in the neurons they sit above. Learn More: Marijuana derivative reduces seizures in people with treatment-resistant epilepsy In this study, the researchers used recordings of 88 seizures from 22 patients.  Localizing epileptic networks is one of the biggest challenges we have in treating medication-resistant epilepsy,  said Litt, who is also director of the Penn Epilepsy Center.  Bringing Dr. Bassett and her team to work with us on this task has tremendous potential to help our patients.  Bassett s research interests involve applying insights from network science to the brain. In earlier work, she and colleagues developed a way of illustrating the functional connectivity between large groups of neurons by comparing the similarity of their activity over time. The similarity between the activation patterns of two large groups of neurons suggests the degree to which they are in communication.  These new computational techniques allow us to see how different parts of the brain are communicating with one another as we go about our daily lives,  Bassett said.  Critically, we can see how these communication patterns change as the brain changes its activity. This new ability offers a fundamental understanding of the functional relationships that drive a seizure.  Because the geographical progression of each patient s seizure is different, the researchers aimed to find some commonality in the network structure of the neuronal groups involved. While the location of the seizure s source might change from person to person, the way the aberrant electrical activity spreads from there may have generalizable patterns. Researchers could then work backwards from those patterns to better identify the source, or devise ways of interrupting that progression to stop a seizure in its tracks. The researchers showed they could predict where a seizure would begin based on network structure alone.  We show there is a high correspondence between certain topological features that are predictive of brain regions that initiate seizures,  Khambhati said.  Specifically, we can use pre-seizure brain activity to determine the regions that are mostly densely interconnected, as they re most likely to be where the seizure starts.  Similar insights also showed the regions to which aberrant activity was likely to spread.  Prior to and during the seizure,  Khambhati said,  the region of the brain where the seizure originates remains densely interconnected, but what we are finding is that, as the seizure is beginning, the less densely connected regions are reconfiguring very rapidly. We believe that rapid reconfiguration is the signal that a seizure is about to manifest.   The researchers believe algorithms based on these network relationships could immediately aid in pinpointing surgical targets in patients  brains and eventually inform implantable devices that can neutralize seizures before they spread.

The work may be used to build graphene-based electrodes that can safely be implanted in the brain, offering promise for the restoration of sensory functions for amputee or paralyzed patients, or for individuals with motor disorders such as epilepsy or Parkinson's disease. The research, published in the journal ACS Nano, was an interdisciplinary collaboration coordinated by the University of Trieste in Italy and the Cambridge Graphene Centre. Previously, other groups had shown that it is possible to use treated graphene to interact with neurons. However the signal to noise ratio from this interface was very low. By developing methods of working with untreated graphene, the researchers retained the material's electrical conductivity, making it a significantly better electrode. See Also: Super-small needle technology for the brain ""For the first time we interfaced graphene to neurons directly,"" said Professor Laura Ballerini of the University of Trieste in Italy. ""We then tested the ability of neurons to generate electrical signals known to represent brain activities, and found that the neurons retained their neuronal signalling properties unaltered. This is the first functional study of neuronal synaptic activity using uncoated graphene based materials."" Our understanding of the brain has increased to such a degree that by interfacing directly between the brain and the outside world we can now harness and control some of its functions. For instance, by measuring the brain's electrical impulses, sensory functions can be recovered. This can be used to control robotic arms for amputee patients or any number of basic processes for paralyzed patients from speech to movement of objects in the world around them. Alternatively, by interfering with these electrical impulses, motor disorders (such as epilepsy or Parkinson's) can start to be controlled. Scientists have made this possible by developing electrodes that can be placed deep within the brain. These electrodes connect directly to neurons and transmit their electrical signals away from the body, allowing their meaning to be decoded. However, the interface between neurons and electrodes has often been problematic: not only do the electrodes need to be highly sensitive to electrical impulses, but they need to be stable in the body without altering the tissue they measure. Too often the modern electrodes used for this interface (based on tungsten or silicon) suffer from partial or complete loss of signal over time. This is often caused by the formation of scar tissue from the electrode insertion, which prevents the electrode from moving with the natural movements of the brain due to its rigid nature. Graphene has been shown to be a promising material to solve these problems, because of its excellent conductivity, flexibility, biocompatibility and stability within the body. Learn More: See-through, one-atom-thick electrodes are a powerful tool for studying brain disorders Based on experiments conducted in rat brain cell cultures, the researchers found that untreated graphene electrodes interfaced well with neurons. By studying the neurons with electron microscopy and immunofluorescence the researchers found that they remained healthy, transmitting normal electric impulses and, importantly, none of the adverse reactions which lead to the damaging scar tissue were seen. According to the researchers, this is the first step towards using pristine graphene-based materials as an electrode for a neuro-interface. In future, the researchers will investigate how different forms of graphene, from multiple layers to monolayers, are able to affect neurons, and whether tuning the material properties of graphene might alter the synapses and neuronal excitability in new and unique ways. ""Hopefully this will pave the way for better deep brain implants to both harness and control the brain, with higher sensitivity and fewer unwanted side effects,"" said Ballerini. ""We are currently involved in frontline research in graphene technology towards biomedical applications,"" said Professor Maurizio Prato from the University of Trieste. ""In this scenario, the development and translation in neurology of graphene-based high-performance biodevices requires the exploration of the interactions between graphene nano- and micro-sheets with the sophisticated signalling machinery of nerve cells. Our work is only a first step in that direction.""

ASD affects around 1 in 100 people in the UK and involves a spectrum of conditions which manifest themselves differently in different people. People with ASD can have varying levels of impairment across three common areas, which might include: deficits in social interactions and reciprocal understanding, repetitive behaviour and narrow interests, and impairment in language and communication. See Also: Face blindness predicted by structural differences in the brain The study, published in the journal Brain, used a novel brain imaging method to identify altered brain connections in people with ASD. The researchers used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance imaging technique, to compare networks of white matter in 61 adults with ASD and 61 controls. White matter consists of large bundles of nerve cells that connect different regions of the brain and enable communication between them. The scans revealed that men with ASD had differences in brain connections in the frontal lobe, a part of the brain that is crucial to developing language and social interaction skills. Specifically, these men had altered development of white matter connections in the left side of the brain, the arcuate bundle, which is involved in language. The differences in the arcuate bundle, which connects areas of the brain involved in understanding words and regions related to speech production, were particularly severe in those who had a significant history of 'delayed echolalia'. Delayed echolalia is very common in ASD and manifests in the parrot-like repetition of words or sentences. Learn More: Brain responses to speech predict early language outcomes in children with autism ASD was also associated with underdevelopment of white matter in the left uncinate bundle, which plays a significant role in face recognition and emotional processing. This also correlated with observations of 'inappropriate use of facial expression' in childhood. Dr. Marco Catani from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King's College London, said: ""White matter provides key insights which allow us to paint a precise picture of how different parts of the brain develop during critical periods in childhood. ""We found subtle brain differences in men who at a very young age had severe problems with communication and social interaction. The differences appear to remain even if they have somehow learned to cope with these difficulties in adult life. ""It is worth noting that the brain differences are visible only with the special research techniques we now have at our disposal. These differences are very subtle and potentially reversible. Thanks to neuroimaging studies like this, it may one day be possible to stimulate the development of these faulty brain connections, or to predict how people with autism respond to treatment."" Dr. Catani added: ""Our study did not include women and children, so it would be interesting to explore whether similar differences exist within these groups. For example, research has shown that women appear more resilient than men when it comes to autism, so it will be important if this is explained biologically in their brain development.""

The algae, Prasinococcus capsulatus, has natural anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties, making them optimum for use in the cosmetics and nutraceutical markets, potentially in sunscreens, moisturisers and wound care products. The ingredients are completely natural   unlike many cosmetic ingredients   and are highly sustainable as production requires only seawater, light and CO2. Products containing these ingredients could be available to consumers within three years. Microalgae is just one example of a resource which could serve as the  raw ingredient  for industrial biotechnology projects. In the future, items we use everyday could be made with biological components, from the plastic bottles we drink from to the fuel we put into our cars; all of which are currently heavily reliant on chemicals and fossil fuels. With the global population set to reach 7.7bn by 2020, sustainable alternatives are a critical outcome that IB can help to deliver. As a specialist in the industrial biotechnology sector, the IBioIC works with more than 50 companies and 200 academics to help stimulate the growth and success of the industry in Scotland and the wider UK, adding an estimated  400million to the Scottish economy alone in industrial biotechnology sales by 2020. Roger Kilburn, CEO of IBioIC said:  Projects like this bring to life exactly what a difference IB can make. We can take something as simple as algae, which you d find in a pond or the sea and create products with real healthcare benefits that are sustainable and have a high market value. Almost every market can use IB to create something new, it s our job to match industry and academic partners to make this happen and speed up the process.  Following the success of the project, IBioIC member Glycomar Ltd and MicroA have formed Prasinotech Ltd, the first algae refinery in the world built to manufacture these polysaccharides from microalgae. Registered in Scotland, Prasinotech will have a major role in Scotland s economy and will be the first company to grow from IBioIC support, which aims to incubate 7 start-ups by 2020. The first two products from Prasinotech Ltd will be active ingredients for use in cosmetic skincare which have a combined annual value of  1m in the third year of production.

Facilitated by TGAC Public Engagement and Society Officer Peter Bickerton, the session showcased topics from fascinating fish, and the orchestra of life to the wonders of microalgae, followed by some in-depth questions, answers and dialogue. A national campaign, PubhD aims to help PhD students explain their research to a lay audience using just a whiteboard and marker pens. The idea is to get across the main focus of their research in terms that anyone can understand before members of the public get the chance to quiz them and discuss over a drink or two. Considering the importance that PhD research has on the bulk of published science, as well as the famous discoveries that have occurred over a pint in the pub (the structure of DNA for one), where events such as this are an extremely valuable experience. Thomas Bradley from the Swarbreck Group at TGAC gave a fascinating talk, entitled  The crafty mechanism of life , using impressive analogies. He had the audience imagine that genes are all part of an orchestra, each one representing a different section - be it horns, violins or percussion. In our different tissues, we have the same genes, yet each section of the orchestra plays louder or more softly; and so our brains might play Mozart while our lungs are playing Beethoven. He then explained his research in terms of the orchestra s  conductor    microRNA   using machine learning algorithms not dissimilar to those used by the internet. His analogies resonated with the crowd, where his talk was described by one audience member as  music to my ears.  Maxwell Rogers, from the Di Palma Group at TGAC, spoke about  Why cichlid fish are awesome  which was equally well received and gave the participants a great insight into the evolution of one of the most wonderfully diverse groups of species on the planet.  He carried on with Thomas s analogy, linking the orchestra of genes to describe how we come to a phenotype   how genes make proteins and all of the different forms that cichlid fish can take. One audience member simply said,  I want to know more,  while another commented that the talk was  really well explained and a very promising experiment, the speaker was very knowledgeable.  Finally, Dr Peter Bickerton gave a lively talk on his PhD project entitled  Stressing algae.  Peter spoke about how green algae are a good model to better understand how animals and plants evolved, as well as some of the complex processes that arose in much more ancient life forms. He explained how algae use calcium as a signal and for a variety of other functions   even to detect light through primitive eyes. One audience member said,  It s amazing how interesting he can make calcium and algae   not an easy job.  The audience of thirty people left feeling both engaged and informed, describing TGAC as  worthwhile  and  very far-reaching; looking forward to all the benefits in the future.  Various people also expressed their interest in hearing more and signed-up to hear about future TGAC events.

What remains difficult is clinical validation of the utility of these biomarkers,  said Murali Prahalad, Ph.D., president and CEO of Epic Sciences.  The clinical trials envisioned and being driven by the Avera Center for Precision Oncology incorporate Epic Sciences  no cell left behind  Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) technology to enable faster development and clinical validation of novel personalized cancer treatments.  The Epic Sciences  CTC detection and characterization platform is used to quantify the proteomic and genomic changes that accumulate in tumor cells over time and in response to repeated rounds of cancer therapy. Following a simple blood draw, the Epic Sciences technology can detect all categories of CTCs in the blood and identify, on a single cell basis, subpopulations of metastatic cancer cells that may be resistant or susceptible to cancer therapies.  This is also known as a  liquid biopsy.  Currently, other technologies exclude many CTCs that do not adhere to assumptions about size or cell surface markers, which precludes a comprehensive view of the heterogeneity among a patient s tumor cells that may affect therapeutic response.  The Epic Sciences platform, however, analyzes all nucleated cells. Avera scientists will use Epic Sciences  CTC detection and analysis platform to explore molecular drivers of disease to determine the predictive utility of the Epic Sciences platform towards biomarker guided therapies.  If successful, this will enable novel liquid biopsy based prediction and monitoring of disease leading to improved therapy decisions and understanding of therapy efficacy.  No tumor is the same, and cancer constantly adapts in order to survive,  said Brian Leyland-Jones, MB BS, PhD, Vice President of Avera Center for Precision Oncology.  Using Epic Sciences  liquid biopsy, we can measure both protein and genomic targets to help provide cancer care that is highly personalized and precise. As we continue to develop molecularly-targeted cancer treatment, liquid biopsy can help us treat more patients more effectively.  Epic Sciences recently announced its platform s capability to interrogate single CTCs with both proteomic and genomic analyses, including deep sequencing of known cancer genes. The approach enables further precision that could potentially influence therapy selection, including the use of combination therapies.","Published: January 29, 2016"
6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/epigenetic-switch-for-obesity-193580,Epigenetic Switch for Obesity Obesity can sometimes be shut down  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. It is well known that a predisposition to adiposity lies in our genes. A new study by researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics in Freiburg now shows that it is also crucial how these genes are regulated. The scientists lead by Andrew Pospisilik discovered a novel regulatory, epigenetic switch, which causes individuals with identical genetic material, such as monozygotic twins, to either be lean or obese. Interestingly, much like a classical light switch there are only two discrete outcomes   ON and OFF, or rather obese and not obese   not continuous increments as with a dimmer. These new insights fundamentally alter our understanding of how epigenetics influences gene outcomes. Our world has a weighty problem. About half a billion people are obese. Obesity is a risk factor for many secondary diseases such as cardiovascular problems, cancer and diabetes. Adiposity is largely controlled by our DNA, and, more recently appreciated, by our environment. The group of Andrew Pospisilik at the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics is particularly interested in investigating such  epigenetic  effects in metabolic diseases. The starting point of their new study was a mouse strain in which only one of two copies of the gene Trim28 was present in the genome. Collaborators in Brisbane, led by Emma Whitelaw, had previously observed that these mice displayed large variations in their body weight despite being genetically identical.  We were intrigued by these findings. They suggested the possibility of a purely epigenetic disease , Andrew Pospisilik says. Either lean or obese When looking at the weight distribution of large cohorts of genetically identical mice, the Max Planck researchers noticed something odd. The body weight of the animals wasn t random, they came in two flavors, either lean or obese.  We were really surprised that the same genotype can lead to two very different but more importantly very stable phenotypes,  says Kevin Dalgaard, first author of the study. By comparing global gene expression in the two populations, the team discovered a network of so-called  imprinted  genes that was significantly lower expressed in obese animals. Imprinted genes are a small subset of genes, which are exclusively expressed from either the maternal or paternal gene copy. Working together with Cambridge teams led by Anne Fergusson-Smith, Steve O Rahilly, Giles Yeo and Anthony Coll, the authors showed that loss of one copy of these imprinted genes also resulted in a  bi-stable  distribution of either lean or obese animals. This confirmed the functional importance of the imprinted network and suggested that it acts like a switch between two distinct phenotypes.  Once the switch is triggered, it is a lifelong, epigenetically-driven decision that ends in a stable, either a lean or obese phenotype"" says Andrew Pospisilik and adds ""Such clearly separated phenotypes have a genetic cause; here, though we found that the effect was non-Mendelian. The effect is akin to a light switch   on or off, lean or obese. Typically, we usually consider epigenetic control of disease to act much more like a dimmer, shifting phenotypes like body weight up or down gradually.  With the goal of testing whether a comparable switch might exist in humans, the Max Planck researchers teamed up with Childhood obesity specialists Antje Koerner and Kathrin Landgraf in Leipzig, Germany, and began analyzing adipose tissue samples from lean and obese children. The results were intriguing. A subset of overweight children, about half of cohort, showed altered expression levels of TRIM28 and the network of imprinted genes, a signature that paralleled their observations in the mice. Exploring published data from identical twins discordant for obesity (i.e. where one twin was obese and the other lean), they found similar trends that supported existence of a similar epigenetic effect in humans. First proof of polyphenism in mammals  Our data not only help to understand the interaction of genetic and epigenetic factors in obesity and other diseases, they have implications for how we think about evolution  says Andrew Pospisilik. The phenomenon that an identical genotype can lead to clearly distinguishable phenotypes is known as polyphenism. A typical example in the animal kingdom is honeybees, where from the same DNA either a queen or worker bee may arise. The study of the Freiburg researchers shows for the first time that the genetic machinery to control polyphenisms also exist in mammals, and likely humans. While difficult to prove, an epigenetic switch that can produce distinctly different phenotypes based on the same DNA, could be a selective advantage.  Taking the whole population into account polyphenism adds diversity and thus could provide a buffer function. If one phenotype is not suited for critical environmental conditions, polyphenism offers a plan B, which could potentially contribute to the survival of the species  says Andrew Pospisilik. Epigenetic therapies for obesity and other diseases? Finally, the results also offer new insights into avenues for epigenetic therapies for complex human diseases. The idea that phenotypes or diseases might have strong switch-like epigenetic origins suggests that certain disease scenarios are entirely epigenetically driven and therefore that epigenetic therapies might be able to flip such switches off.  Our next major goal is to see whether we can modify this process, whether we can turn the disease switch on or off by supplementing diet, minimizing stress, or giving epigenetically relevant pro-drugs. The hope is that we can permanently flip the system back to lean in one shot  says Andrew Pospisilik.","Published: January 29, 2016"

LifebankUSA was founded by HLI co-founder Robert J. Hariri, M.D., Ph.D. Approximately 30 employees of LifebankUSA will join HLI. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to conclude in the first quarter of 2016. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. The cord and placental blood and tissue provide high quality DNA from mother and newborn for genome sequencing. Following the closing of the acquisition, HLI will start offering its newborn genome sequencing product along with stem cell banking. Having the newborn genome can provide families with relevant baseline information about their child s health journey, including the risk of preventable or treatable childhood diseases, food allergies and adverse drug reactions. HLI anticipates offering this product beginning in the second quarter of 2016.  Stem cells are an important component to understanding and unlocking insights into human biology and human disease. This is a unique acquisition that gives HLI the ability to combine the power of stem cells with newborn genome analysis to offer parents new information and potential treatments for their families,  said J. Craig Venter, Ph.D., Co-founder and CEO, HLI. Cord and placental blood and tissue are ideal sources of stem cells and biomaterials. Stem cell transplantation has been successfully used in the treatment of many blood cancers, inherited metabolic diseases and congenital and acquired immunological diseases but have the potential to be used for the treatment of a variety of other diseases including cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, diabetes, stroke and heart disease. LifebankUSA is unique in offering banking of not only cord blood and tissue cells but also of placental cells and tissues. Their proprietary process yields 60-70% more of a particular type of cell called a CD34+ stem cell which are the critical stem cells for bone marrow and cord blood transplants. Studies have shown that using more CD34+ stem cells can lead to a significant survival advantage in transplant patients. Placental and cord blood and placental tissue also contain mesenchymal-like cells (stem cells which can differentiate into a variety of cell types) which may prove valuable in new treatments. Dr. Hariri is a pioneer in the use of stem cells and engineered tissue products to treat a variety of life threatening diseases.

'We have a path to a cure,' said corresponding author Dr Steven Wolinsky, chief of infectious diseases at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a Northwestern Medicine physician. 'The challenge now is to deliver drugs at clinically effective concentrations to where the virus continues to replicate within the patient.' Combinations of potent antiretroviral drugs quickly suppress HIV to undetectable levels in the bloodstream of most patients, but HIV persists in a viral reservoir within lymphoid tissue in the body. The virus rapidly rebounds in the blood if patients stop their drugs. This suggests that long-lived latently infected cells and/or ongoing low levels of HIV replication maintain these viral reservoirs. Up until now, most scientists believed the reservoir only contained long-lived infected cells in a resting state rather than newly infected cells, for two principal reasons. First, no one had seen viruses with the new genetic mutations that inevitably arise when HIV completes cycles of growth. Second, most patients do not develop the drug resistance mutations that might seem likely if HIV was growing in the presence of drugs. The team examined viral sequences in serial samples of cells from lymph nodes and blood from three HIV-infected patients from the University of Minnesota, USA, who had no detectable virus in their blood. Scientists found that the viral reservoir was, in fact, constantly replenished by low-level virus replication in lymphoid tissue, with infected cells then moving from these protected sanctuaries into the blood. Because infected cells in drug-sanctuaries within lymphoid tissue can still produce new viruses, infect new target cells and replenish the viral reservoir, it has not been possible to purge the body of latently infected cells and eradicate the virus. A mathematical model, developed by Dr Helen Fryer of the Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford, tracked the amount of virus and the number of infected cells as they grew and evolved in drug sanctuaries before moving through the body. The model explains how HIV can grow in drug sanctuaries in lymphoid tissue where antiretroviral drug concentrations are lower than in the blood, and why viruses with mutations that create high-level drug resistance do not necessarily emerge. The findings provide a new perspective on how HIV persists in the body despite potent antiretroviral therapy. The study also explains why the development of drug resistance is not inevitable when virus growth occurs in a place where drug concentrations are very low. Most importantly, this new understanding highlights how important it is to deliver high concentrations of antiretroviral drugs to all locations in the body where HIV can grow. Drugs that penetrate the newly discovered sanctuaries will be a prerequisite to the elimination of the viral reservoir and, ultimately, a step towards a cure. 'The study is exciting because it really changes how we think about what is happening in treated patients,' said co-author Professor Angela McLean, Professor of Mathematical Biology at Oxford University, who supervised the mathematical modelling. 'It helps explain why some strategies that tried to clear the reservoir have failed.' Dr Helen Fryer added: 'By learning more about how HIV continues to exist within treated individuals, we are one step closer to finding a cure.'","Published: January 29, 2016"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/faster-drug-discovery-194290,Faster Drug Discovery  Startup develops more cost effective test for assessing how cells respond to chemicals  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. For pharmaceutical firms, gene-expression profiling has become a valuable tool for drug discovery. This process involves measuring the activity of a cell s genes in response to drugs, to determine the compounds  effectiveness, toxicity, and other characteristics. Conventional profiling methods, however, are inefficient or expensive, sometimes costing millions of dollars. Now Genometry has commercialized a high-throughput gene-expression assay developed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, which operates at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods. It does so by using measurements of 1,000 genes to accurately and quickly estimate the activity of all the 20,000 or so genes expressed in a cell. The fast, low-cost assay allows for much larger experiments than previously possible, and for gene-expression profiling to be used much earlier in the drug-discovery process   which could speed things up, says Genometry co-founder, president, and CEO Justin Lamb, a former Broad Institute researcher.  Rather than profiling only a handful of compounds at the end of the search for a new drug to confirm that you got what you wanted, you can use profiling right at the start of the search, and hence do the search in much more efficient ways, because you have much more information,  he says. A dozen pharmaceutical firms and other companies are now using the assay. Last October, Genometry signed a multiyear contract with Janssen Pharmaceutica to generate gene-expression profiles for 250,000 compounds in the Belgian firm s small-molecule library. This represents the first time gene-expression profiling has been applied at such a large scale. The data will be used for drug screening and improving the selection of candidate drugs before clinical studies. Lamb co-developed the assay, called L1000, with researchers in Broad Institute Chief Scientific Officer Todd Golub s group, including Genometry co-founder Aravind Subramanian and David Peck, both currently researchers at the Broad. Landmark genes For gene-expression profiling, researchers have traditionally used microarrays, pieces of DNA arranged on silicon wafers, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which copies DNA fragments in test tubes. PCR is more accurate, but microarrays are faster: It takes the same amount of time to measure a few dozen genes using PCR as it does to measure an entire transcriptome   the full range of genes expressed in a cell  using microarrays. But these experiments, Subramanian says, can cost up to $500 to generate the cellular response to a single drug or other  perturbagen.  Matching signatures against libraries of a million or so drug candidates and different cell types, adds up. L1000 takes advantage of the fact  that genes don t act independently of each other. They travel in clusters,  according to Subramanian. Instead of recording all the gene expression in a cell, L1000 measures the expression of approximately 1,000 so-called landmark genes that have been selected because they have special qualities, such as being minimally redundant across the genome or widely expressed in different cell types. According to Subramanian, because of these properties, the landmark genes together contain around 80 percent of the information in the entire transcriptome. Genometry provides L1000 as a service. Clients send lysate   a fluid of broken-apart cells   in 384-well plates, usually dozens at a time, to Genometry s headquarters and lab in Kendall Square. After some initial processing, the samples are mixed with microscopic beads of different colors coated with DNA from landmark genes, before being run through a version of a flow cytometer. Varying fluorescence intensity of each bead denotes varying degrees of each gene s expression. Based on those measurements, a computational inference model infers how all other genes will behave. With fewer measurements, throughput increases and the price drops to a few dollars per sample, compared with $500 by other methods. Pharmaceutical firms will use L1000 data from potentially hundred of thousands of compounds as an initial screen, or to characterize their entire library of chemicals, as is the case with Janssen. Firms could also use the data for  hit selection  to narrow down the number of viable candidate drugs, Lamb says. A firm may have, say, 1,000 compounds to potentially treat a certain disease. Running those through L1000 will quickly reduce that number to perhaps 50 of most selective compounds and the ones with the fewest off-target effects.  It s a convenient way to prioritize compounds for drug development,  Lamb says.  Google  for drug discovery In 2012, Lamb and Subramanian formed Genometry to commercialize L1000, only after it had proven its mettle at Broad Institute.  The purpose of [Genometry] was not so much to take a hand-wavy academic idea and make it into a product   it was to take a tried, tested, and proven technology and come up with a mechanism by which the outside world can get easy and effective access to that innovation,  Lamb says. L1000 was developed for   and has become an integral component of   an ongoing Broad Institute project called the Connectivity Map, which aims to become, essentially,  Google for drug discovery,  according to the project s website. The Connectivity Map, launched in 2005, is a collection of gene-expression responses to perturbagens, including chemical and genetic manipulations.  If you describe the actions of drugs, the effects of genetic manipulation, and disease states in a common language, connecting a disease with a potential remedy, for example, is a relatively easy pattern-matching problem. Gene expression provides a particularly good vocabulary for this,  Lamb explains. Users of the Connectivity Map, for instance, can upload a list of genes whose expression pattern characterizes a disease and, with one click, receive a list of compounds ranked by their effect on those genes. It s similar to using keywords in Google to call up pages ranked by their relevance, Subramanian says. At the Broad Institute, L1000 has now helped researchers archive profiles for around 5,000 drugs   about half the drugs ever tested in humans   and perturbation of 3,000 genes using CRISPR genome editing and other tools. The Broad Institute hopes to amass data on the connections among all drugs, genes, and diseases in the near future, Subramanian says. Lamb says Genometry aims to help pharmaceutical firms use gene-expression data to effectively digitize their compound collections. In doing so, firms can use various tools to  search for compounds with desirable characteristics, determine if new chemical matter will be effective against various diseases, or if they are too similar to existing drugs to be commercially viable,  he says.  It s important to not just digitize libraries available to academics,  Subramanian adds,  but to also make sure companies are achieving the impact they want. ","Published: January 29, 2016"

The multinational study suggests a new way of classifying gliomas that may have a significant impact on patient management and may lead to the development of more targeted therapies. Currently, pathologists determine if a glioma is low-grade or high-grade based on the tumor tissue s appearance under the microscope. While this approach is generally good at distinguishing between gliomas that are clearly very aggressive and those that are relatively slow-growing, it misses the mark in a significant percentage of cases, leading to inappropriate treatment,  said co-senior author Antonio Iavarone, MD, professor of neurology and pathology and cell biology (in the Institute for Cancer Genetics) at CUMC and a member of the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) at NewYork-Presbyterian /Columbia University Medical Center.  Instead, by looking at the molecular makeup of these tumors, we now have a much more precise way of predicting which tumors are more likely to grow rapidly and can prescribe treatments accordingly.  Other researchers have attempted to classify gliomas according to their genetic characteristics. One study found that tumors with mutations in a gene called IDH were significantly less aggressive than those without the mutation, known as IDHwildtype tumors. However, these findings did not fully explain why some patients with IDHmutant tumors fare worse than expected and some with IDHwildtype tumors fare better than expected. Other studies suggested that a glioma s level of DNA methylation, an epigenetic process that cells use to control gene expression, might explain a tumor s aggressiveness, but the evidence was inconclusive. In this study, Dr. Iavarone and his colleagues analyzed 1,122 high and low grade glioma samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas, looking for epigenetic changes in the tumors  DNA. The researchers found that the best predictor of progression in an IDHmutant glioma the less-aggressive variety is its level of DNA methylation. Among IDHmutant gliomas, those with a high degree of DNA methylation progressed more slowly. However, tumors with less DNA methylation, about 6 percent of the total, progressed very quickly.  Based on their appearance under the microscope, these aggressive tumors looked very much like the other IDHmutant tumors,  said Dr. Iavarone.  But from a disease prognosis standpoint, they progressed quite similarly to the more lethal subset of IDHwildtype gliomas,  said Dr. Iavarone. Among those with IDHwildtype gliomas the most aggressive type a small subset (about 6 percent) had relatively favorable clinical outcomes. The molecular characteristics of this group were similar to those of pilocytic astrocytomas, a childhood brain tumor with a relatively favorable survival rate.  The present study advances the understanding of the glioma division by correlating each subtype of DNA methylation with a distinct clinical outcome,  said co-senior author Houtan Noushmehr, PhD, professor of epigenomics and bioinformatics at University of S o Paulo and director of the OMICs and Bioinformatics lab at FMRP at Ribeir o Preto, S o Paulo.  We discovered low grade and high grade gliomas mixed together within these different epigenetic subtypes. This was an unexpected finding and allowed us to further understand the progression of gliomas within the different subtypes,  said Dr. Noushmehr.  This research has expanded our knowledge of the glioma somatic alteration landscape and emphasized the relevance of DNA methylation profiles as a method for clinical classification,  said senior co-author Roel Verhaak, PhD, associate professor of bioinformatics and computational biology MD Anderson.  These findings are an important step forward in our understanding of glioma as discrete disease subsets, and the mechanism driving glioma formation and progression.  The paper also identified several previously unrecognized genetic alterations that may contribute to glioma development, highlighting potential new targets for drug therapy.  This study, which focused on tumor classification, does not point to specific therapies for glioma,  said Dr. Iavarone.  But our findings will help clinicians identify subsets of patients with IDHmutant tumors who need to be treated more aggressively and those with IDHwildtype tumors who can be spared aggressive treatment.

The study is a collaboration between several institutions and opens the way to better understand the mechanisms of action of drugs that prevent cancer cell growth. The study To adapt to the small size of cell nuclei, DNA wraps around proteins called histones to form chromatin. Cells can chemically modify histones so as to change chromatin structure and thereby control the various functions of DNA. Recent research has shown that new drugs that inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs), which affect chromatin, are promising for cancer treatment. The study by Dr. Wurtele's research team and collaborators used yeast as a model system to understand, at a molecular level, the mechanisms that influence cell growth in the presence of a particular class of HDACs. The experiments demonstrate that Class III HDACs, which influence various cellular processes involved in carcinogenesis and response to chemotherapy agents, strongly block cell proliferation by preventing the normal functioning of various factors involved in the response to DNA damage spontaneously generated by cellular metabolism. ""This basic research allows for a better understanding of the overall effects of HDAC inhibitors on cells and can eventually lead to an optimization of their clinical use,"" said Dr. Wurtele. These findings will guide future research at Dr. Wurtele's laboratory to determine how this new class of drugs inhibits the growth of cancer cells.","Published: January 29, 2016"

The study from researchers at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego also uncovered some good news, concentrations of these pollutants have been consistently dropping over the last 30 years. The findings were based on an analysis by Scripps researchers Lindsay Bonito, Amro Hamdoun, and Stuart Sandin of hundreds of peer-reviewed articles from 1969-2012. The pollutants studied included older 'legacy' chemicals, such as DDT and mercury, as well as newer industrial chemicals, such as flame retardants and coolants. ""Based on the best data collected from across the globe, we can say that POPs can be anywhere and in any species of marine fish,"" said Scripps biologist Sandin, a co-author of the study. Although POPs were found in fish in all of the world's oceans, the researchers say that concentrations in the consumable meat of marine fish are highly variable, where one region or group of fish may find concentrations of POPs that vary by 1,000-fold. The analysis revealed that average concentrations of each class of POP were significantly higher in the 1980s than is found today, with a drop in concentration of 15-30 percent per decade. ""This means that the typical fish that you consume today can have approximately 50 percent of the concentration of most POPs when compared to the same fish eaten by your parents at your age,"" said Bonito, the lead author of the study. ""But there still remains a chance of getting a fillet as contaminated as what your parents ate."" The researchers also compared the results to federal safety guidelines for seafood consumption and found that the average levels of contaminants were at or below the health standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Mercury and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl) concentrations were at the EPA threshold for occasional human consumption, while concentrations of DDT were consistently much lower than the established threshold. According to the authors, these results suggest that the global community has responded to the calls-to-action, such as in the Stockholm Convention, to limit the release of potentially harmful chemicals into the environment. The authors caution that although pollutant concentrations in marine fish are steadily declining, they still remain quite high, and that understanding the cumulative effects of numerous exposures to pollutants in seafood is necessary to determine the specific risk to consumers.","Published: January 29, 2016"

Several past human studies have suggested a correlative link between maternal viral infection during pregnancy and risk of autism spectrum disorder. Mouse models have been created and used to study how maternal immune activation influences autism-like behavior, but the mechanism underlying this was not known until now. See Also: New insights into the male bias of autism The study led by researchers from the University of Massachusetts Medical School, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, NYU Langone Medical Center and the University of Colorado, Boulder, shows that increased production of a cytokine called interleukin-17a by a subset of helper T cells (Th17) was the mechanism by which the inflammatory response in the mother led to mouse versions of ASD symptoms in the offspring: deficits in social approach behavior, abnormal communication and increases in repetitive behavior. ""Blocking the function of Th17 cells and IL-17a in the maternal womb by using antibodies and other genetic techniques completely restored normal behavior and brain structure in the affected offspring,"" said Jun R. Huh, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases and immunology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and a corresponding author on the study. ""The study also showed that a therapeutic treatment with antibodies blocking IL-17a corrected certain behavioral abnormalities, suggesting Th17 cells, as well as the specific proteins they produce, may be candidate therapeutic targets in efforts to prevent autism in the children of susceptible mothers."" ""To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify a specific population of immune cells that may have a direct role in causing behaviors linked to autism,"" said immunologist and another corresponding author Dan Littman, MD, PhD, the Helen L. and Martin S. Kimmel Professor of Molecular Immunology in the Department of Pathology at NYU Langone Medical Center. Littman noted that the immune reactions in the current study linked to autism risk are the kind caused only by viral infections in the mother, and have ""nothing whatsoever to do with vaccines."" Some have linked childhood vaccination to autism risk despite ""overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary."" The new study centers on T lymphocytes, immune cells that react to infections by expanding into a cellular army that attacks the invading microbe at hand. A subset of T cells, Th17 cells release interleukin 17 (IL-17), a signaling protein (cytokine) that amplifies normal immune responses to fend off infections. When overactive or off target, cytokines contribute to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases like psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. Th17 cells supply most of a version of IL-17 called IL-17a. Specifically, the study found that activation of Th17 cells and related IL-17a production are the core mechanisms by which inflammation in mouse mothers create behavioral abnormalities in their litters. The results in particular point to Th17 cell activation regulated by retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma t (ROR gamma t), which turns on genes that enable T cells to mature and produce IL-17a in humans and mice. In behavioral experiments, the study authors found that exposure in the womb to IL-17a, produced in higher levels in reaction to injecting the mother with poly-I:C, created autism-like symptoms. For example, mice exposed to higher IL-17a levels in the womb had trouble telling the difference between another live mouse and a toy. They interacted with both equally, whereas normal mice spent more time socially interacting with live mice. In terms of communication differences, mouse pups are known to cry to their mothers, but recordings revealed that offspring exposed to IL-17a inflammation vocalized abnormally. Mice exposed to this kind of immune response were also more likely to bury marbles found in their cages one after the other in a compulsive, repetitive behavior. Learn More: Largest-ever autism genome study finds most siblings have different autism-risk genes The research team also found that Th17-driven inflammation via IL-17a interfered with normal development of certain regions of the brain. Otherwise carefully ordered nerve cell layers became chaotic in the cortex, the part of the brain that sculpts sights and sounds into thoughts. The team focused on this feature because disorganized cortical architecture had been found in past studies of human patients with autism. Blocking the action of Th17 cells completely restored normal structure and function to the brains of the study offspring, regardless of whether this was accomplished by treatment with anti-IL17a antibodies or by blocking the expression of ROR gamma to shut down the IL-17a gene. ""We don't know yet how these findings are correlated in humans,"" said Huh. ""We need to find out, for example, whether Th17 cells have the same key function in human mothers as in mice, so what is needed next is a human study to monitor IL-17a levels in a large number of women, including those infected with viruses or who have autoimmune conditions, during pregnancy and correlate those levels with the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in children over several years.""

However, information also flows in the opposite direction, e.g. to direct attention to particular stimuli. But how does the brain know which path the information should take? Researchers at the Ernst Str ngmann Institute (ESI) for Neuroscience in Frankfurt in Cooperation with Max Planck Society have now demonstrated that the visual cortex of human subjects uses different frequency channels depending on the direction in which information is being transported. Their findings were only possible thanks to previous research with macaque monkeys. They might help to understand the cause of psychiatric illnesses in which the two channels appear to be mixed up.  See Also: Movies synchronize brains The terms  bottom-up  and  top-down  refer to processes by which the human brain processes information.  In the visual system, bottom-up communication occurs when information enters through the eyes and flows from lower to higher visual areas, i.e. from bottom to top,  explains Pascal Fries from the Ernst Str ngmann Institute for Neuroscience. As soon as a person observes the environment, sensory input is continuously processed using the bottom-up principle. But how do we know that one piece of information is more important than another? Fries:  The top-down principle helps us to do this. The brain uses previous experiences to organize information in the present context and to make predictions on this basis.  The top-down flow therefore influences the bottom-up flow and steers our attention towards things that are important in the current situation. This can happen automatically, for example due to the sudden appearance of a threatening stimulus, as well as through attention, for example when we are looking for something or following instructions.  Many of our cognitive capabilities can only be explained by invoking this principle,  says Fries. For the top-down principle to work, the brain requires mechanisms that pass information from higher to lower areas of the brain. The anatomical connections in the top-down direction are known for a long time, but how the information is sent through these connections has remained elusive. Macaque monkeys helped Fries and his colleagues to get on the right track. First, they examined the bottom-up flow in the brains of those animals and found that it uses a particular frequency band of rhythmic neuronal activity, known as the gamma band, around 60 Hertz. Information flows from bottom to top, when rhythmic oscillatory activity of lower brain areas entrains the rhythm of the next higher area. Subsequently, the neuroscientists discovered the channel for top-down information flow, namely the so-called alpha and beta frequency rhythms, between 10 and 20 Hertz. Thus, in essence, the hierarchically arranged areas of visual cortex use a separate frequency channel to send information from higher to lower areas. In their present work, the researchers show that a very similar principle is at work in the human brain.  We knew the rhythms and wanted to look for them in the human brain,  explains Fries. To do this, they used a technique known as magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG uses sensors outside the head to record the magnetic fields, which result from the electric currents of active nerve cells. The measurements allow conclusions to be drawn about the activity in certain areas of the brain.  In the raw MEG data, signals from several brain areas are mixed and have to be separated as well as possible using advanced mathematical methods,  says Fries. This is one of the reasons why the investigations into the macaque brain were so important. As macaques have a very similar brain to humans, scientific insights obtained on macaques can often be transferred to humans. It was thanks to the previous work on the animals that the researchers were able to interpret the MEG measurements correctly. Learn More: How the brain pays attention: Identifying regions of the brain dealing with object-based, spatial attention In their experiments, the researchers demonstrate that the human brain also uses different frequency ranges for bottom-up and top-down signalling. Furthermore, the neurophysiologists were able to describe the hierarchical positioning of additional areas, some of which only present in the human brain. A total of 26 areas were investigated in the human brain. The new findings might help us to better understand the causes of some psychiatric illnesses to one day be able to treat them. In some mental illnesses, the top-down and bottom-up flow seem to get mixed up. There are indications that in individuals with schizophrenia, the top-down flow does not interact with the bottom-up flow in a normal way.  A healthy person can distinguish between sensory inputs and their interpretation produced in higher areas. For example, they can see facial features in a cloud without thinking that the cloud is a face. Schizophrenic patients may think the face is real, potentially taking the top-down interpretation for a bottom-up sensation,  explains Fries.

The mechanism by which the iron wreaks damage on neurons involved in PD has not been clear. Research from the Andersen lab at the Buck Institute suggests that the damage stems from an impairment in the lysosome the organelle that acts as a cellular recycling center for damaged proteins. Scientists report the impairment allows excess iron to escape into the neurons where it causes toxic oxidative stress. The research is published in The Journal of Neuroscience. See Also: Two proteins work together to help cells eliminate trash and Parkinson s may result when they don t Lysosomes are key to the autophagy process whereby damaged proteins are broken down into building blocks that are used to make newly-built proteins to take their place. It's the cellular equivalent of recycling. With age, the ability of the lysosome to participate in autophagy becomes slower, resulting in the build-up of non-protein ""garbage"" within the cells. Less-than-optimal autophagy has been associated with several age-related diseases, including PD. ""It's recently been realized that one of the most important functions of the lysosome is to store iron in a place in the cell where it is not accessible to participate in toxic oxidative stress-producing reactions,"" said Julie K. Andersen, PhD, senior scientist and Buck Institute faculty. ""Now we have demonstrated that a mutation in a lysosomal gene results in the toxic release of iron into the cell resulting in neuronal cell death."" Learn More: Nano-antioxidants prove their potential Spearheaded by staff scientist Shankar J. Chinta, PhD, the work (done in both mice and cultured human dopaminergic cells) involved a mutation in a gene (ATP13A2) associated with a rare early onset form of PD called Kufor-Rakeb syndrome. When researchers knocked out ATP13A2 the lysosome was unable to maintain the balance of iron within the cell. The mutation responsible for Kufor-Rakeb was identified in 2010. Those suffering from the condition, which is named for the village in Jordan where the syndrome was first described, experience disease onset in adolescence. ""Mutations in this same gene have also been recently linked to sporadic forms of PD,"" said Andersen. ""This suggests that age-related impairments in lysosomal function that impact the ability of neurons to maintain a healthy balance of iron are part of what underlies the presentation of PD in the general population.""

The study provided an important link between the observed excessive iron in the brains of PD patients and oxidative stress associated with neurodegeneration. ""The issue with iron chelation is that it's a sledge hammer it pulls iron from the cells indiscriminately and iron is needed throughout the body for many biological functions,"" said Andersen.

The corticolimbic system governs emotional regulation and processing and plays a role in mood disorders, including depression. See Also: Genetics in depression: What's known, what's next A large body of human clinical research indicates a strong association in depression between mothers and daughters, while many previous animal studies have shown that female offspring are more likely than males to show changes in emotion-associated brain structures in response to maternal prenatal stress. Until now, however, there have been few studies that attempted to link the two streams of research, said lead author Fumiko Hoeft, MD, PhD, a UCSF associate professor of psychiatry. The finding does not mean that mothers are necessarily responsible for their daughters' depression, Hoeft said. ""Many factors play a role in depression - genes that are not inherited from the mother, social environment, and life experiences, to name only three. Mother-daughter transmission is just one piece of it. ""But this is the first study to bridge animal and human clinical research and show a possible matrilineal transmission of human corticolimbic circuitry, which has been implicated in depression, by scanning both parents and offspring,"" said Hoeft, who directs the UCSF Hoeft Laboratory for Educational Neuroscience. ""It opens the door to a whole new avenue of research looking at intergenerational transmission patterns in the human brain."" The study is published in the Journal of Neuroscience. The corticolimbic system includes the amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Hoeft and her research team used non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure gray matter volume (GMV) in the corticolimbic systems of parents and their biological offspring from 35 healthy families. None of the family members were diagnosed with depression. The association between mothers' and daughters' corticolimbic GMV was significantly greater than that between mothers and sons, fathers and sons, and fathers and daughters. The study is the first to use MRI in both parents and their children to study intergenerational transmission of the pattern of brain structures, said Hoeft. ""This gives us a potential new tool to better understand depression and other neuropsychiatric conditions, as most conditions seem to show intergenerational transmission patterns,"" she said. ""Anxiety, autism, addition, schizophrenia, dyslexia, you name it - brain patterns inherited from both mothers and fathers have an impact on just about all of them."" One limitation of the study, said Hoeft, is that it does not differentiate between the potential effects of genetics, prenatal conditions and postnatal conditions on the inheritance of brain structures. She hopes that a new study funded by the UCSF Academic Senate, which is just getting under way, will address that shortcoming. Learn More: If you make impulsive choices you should blame your parents -- it's genetic Hoeft and her team will use MRI to study brain structures in families where children have been conceived and delivered using different types of in vitro fertilization (IVF). The researchers will image the brains of parents and children in families where the birth mother was implanted with a donor egg; families where a surrogate was implanted with the biological mother's egg; and families where the mother was implanted with her own fertilized egg in a procedure known as homologous IVF. ""With donor eggs, there is no maternal genetic input, but there is maternal prenatal and postnatal influence,"" Hoeft explained. ""In gestational surrogacy, there is genetic and postnatal input from the biological mother, but no prenatal input. With homologous IVF, there are maternal genetic, prenatal and postnatal influences. Comparison of these three groups allows us to control for potential effects of the IVF procedure itself."" By studying these different family groups, she said, ""we will for the very first time be able to examine, and hopefully distinguish between, the effects of genetics, prenatal environment and postnatal environment on brain function, structure, and cognitive function."" While Hoeft and her team are funded to look at corticolimbic circuitry, ""this does not preclude our looking at other brain systems,"" she said.

A Florida State University researcher who is one of the nation's foremost experts in suicide is trying to find out. Thomas Joiner, the Robert O. Lawton Distinguished Professor of Psychology, led a team of researchers in examining scientific knowledge and drawing parallels between suicide in humans and the self-sacrificial behaviors of colony-like or eusocial species such as shrimp, mole rats and insects. See Also: The brain can be trained to regulate negative emotions, study says ""The idea that something mysterious and scary like suicide in humans could have some sort of analog in animals is not only kind of fascinating, but also really promising in terms of trying to figure it all out,"" Joiner said. In a paper recently published in the journal Psychological Review, the researchers theorize that humans exhibit the characteristics of eusocial species such as relying on multigenerational and cooperative care of young and utilizing division of labor for successful survival. ""Humans are a species that is eusocial, and that's an important starting point,"" Joiner said. ""That suggests a certain set of characteristics, including some really striking self-sacrifice behaviors."" Those eusocial behaviors, understood as part of what is called inclusive fitness in evolutionary biology, are adaptive. ""The idea is if you give up yourself, which would include your genes, it can be evolutionarily speaking 'worth it' if you spare or save multiple copies of your genes in your relatives,"" Joiner said. ""It's a net benefit on the gene level."" However, when the researchers look at human suicide in a modern context, they surmise that suicide among humans represents a derangement of the self-sacrificial aspect of eusociality. ""It seems highly maladaptive and very psychopathological,"" Joiner said. ""That's the quandary we're facing with this paper. Is it possible that modern human suicide is a maladaptive or deranged version of the adaptive, behavioral model for self sacrifice that all eusocial species have?"" The hope is this theory will spur a search for exactly what that disorder is at the brain level in order to demystify the phenomenon of suicide and further suicide prevention efforts. ""If you can identify animal models for this behavior and understand its circuitry at the neurochemical and neurophysiological levels, then it might lead to new insights about similar circuitry that fail in human suicide,"" Joiner said.

The magazine recognized Agilent for its exclusive dual-needle technology, a breakthrough in the way samples are injected into the company's liquid chromatographs, which separate the samples into their individual parts. Awards from The Analytical Scientist highlight innovations delivered by transformative technology. The magazine's editorial board, along with a panel of independent experts, chooses the winners. As one judge put it: ""[Agilent's] innovation looks very simple, but simply addresses a complex problem."" Agilent introduced dual-needle technology as part of a new autosampler for its ultra-high-performance 1290 Infinity II LC system, which enables scientists to identify and quantify the individual components in a mixture. ""Dual-needle technology transports LC-autosampler usage to a new level of efficiency, opening new possibilities to our customers in their analytical work,"" said Dr. Stefan Schuette, Agilent vice president and general manager of the Liquid Phase Separations Division. The award-winning technology provides two sample flow paths within a single instrument. Having two independent paths means that during an analytical run, the instrument can prepare the next sample for fast injection. Smartly overlapping injections reduces run times-a key concern for many labs. The technology also gives scientists more flexibility, enabling them to run a different sample volume on each port without having to manually change the hardware. Being able to use the same instrument and calibration simplifies the process, eliminates variables between different instruments, and reduces errors.","Published: January 28, 2016"

The agreement provides OncoCyte the exclusive rights to commercialize this lung cancer diagnostic test. Since 2013, OncoCyte and Wistar have been collaborating on product development of the lung cancer diagnostic test. In 2015, positive interim clinical results demonstrating the high level of observed sensitivity and specificity in the assayed samples of a prototype blood test for lung cancer were presented at the American Thoracic Society International Conference. Now, both parties are finalizing this assay, which is intended to serve as a confirmatory test for patients who are at risk for lung cancer (based on a patient s positive or suspicious results identified by low dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening). If successful scientific and technical results are achieved, OncoCyte will proceed to the test s final validation with the goal of completing work in 2016 to enable its commercial launch.  This global licensing agreement is an important milestone as we move toward commercializing our blood test for lung cancer,  said William Annett, OncoCyte s chief executive officer.  OncoCyte now has exclusive access to patented and unpatented technology developed at Wistar, including its scientific and technical lung cancer diagnostic expertise. This will be critical as we conclude our clinical studies, conduct the test s validation study, and, if that work is successful, commercialize the new cancer diagnostic test. Our lung cancer test addresses a large unmet need for the estimated 10 million high risk patients in the U.S. who require annual testing. Today s standard of care, LDCT screening, has a high false positive rate, so our lung cancer test is intended to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs to the healthcare system through the early and accurate detection of cancer.   The signing of this licensing agreement is an additional milestone in what has been a particularly successful partnership between Wistar and OncoCyte and another step forward in realizing our common goal to develop new applications that will benefit populations that are at risk for developing lung cancer,  said Louise Showe, Ph.D, professor in the Molecular and Cellular Oncogenesis Program, associate director of the Center for System s and Computational Biology, and scientific director of the Bioinformatics Facility and the Genomics Facility at The Wistar Institute.","Published: January 28, 2016"

The acquisition of Fluorinov is transformative and adds several new dimensions to Trillium, including a risk-reduced internal drug discovery engine, a series of established preclinical oncology programs, and new business development and collaboration opportunities,  commented Dr. Niclas Stiernholm, Trillium s Chief Executive Officer.  The future of cancer treatment is most likely going to be dominated by combination therapies, and we believe that this will often involve combining large and small molecules. This is why we chose to acquire our own small molecule platform that can provide us with a great variety of drug candidates. Having capabilities in both large and small molecule drug development provides us with more flexibility, and makes us better prepared for the future.  Fluorinov s most advanced preclinical oncology programs include potent, orally-available, bromodomain and proteasome inhibitors, as well as epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists with increased uptake in the brain, all of which have been differentiated from competitors and have potential for best-in-class status. In addition, a number of compounds directed at undisclosed immuno-oncology targets are currently in the discovery phase. With this acquisition Trillium is well positioned to internally investigate a variety of combination therapies with targeted oral small molecule drugs and large molecule immunotherapies.  There s no question that Trillium s highest priority is to execute on our clinical CD47 program. However, acquiring a discovery engine with a demonstrated ability to generate high quality preclinical development candidates will significantly enhance our oncology pipeline,  commented Trillium s Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Bob Uger.  Our current plan is to advance one, or possibly two, of Fluorinov s existing preclinical programs through the IND-enabling phase using our internal development group, while at the same time focusing our new chemistry group on several of the existing immuno-oncology discovery programs. Importantly, this strategy does not engage or dilute the efforts of our CD47- focused clinical team, does not dramatically impact our burn rate and future financing plans, and may provide opportunities for future partnerships and collaborations.  Under the terms of the agreements, Trillium has agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Fluorinov for an upfront payment of C$10 million in cash (~US$7 million), plus up to C$35 million (~US$25 million) of additional future payments that are contingent on Trillium achieving certain clinical and regulatory milestones with an existing Fluorinov compound. Trillium will also have an obligation to make low to mid single digit royalty payments on future sales of such compounds. The upfront payment will be subject to adjustment based on the net working capital of Fluorinov and other adjustments at the time of closing. At Trillium s discretion, up to 50% of the future contingent payments can be satisfied through the issuance of common shares of Trillium ( Common Shares ), provided that the aggregate number of Common Shares issuable under such payments will not exceed 1,558,447 common shares (or 19.99% of the current outstanding Common Shares) unless shareholder approval has first been obtained. In addition, any such future share issuance remains subject to final approval from Trillium s board of directors and receipt of any requisite approvals under the applicable rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange ( TSX ) and the NASDAQ Stock Market ( NASDAQ ).  While we have had several third party proposals for individual Fluorinov programs in the past, the choice to merge with Trillium and join their leadership team was an easy one. The recent success with their lead program targeting CD47, and their emerging reputation as Canada s leading immuno-oncology company made this a perfect fit for Fluorinov,  added Dr. Malik Slassi, Fluorinov s founder, President and Chief Executive Officer.

People with the illness show fewer such connections between neurons, or synapses.  The gene switched on more in people with the suspect versions, who faced a higher risk of developing the disorder, characterized by hallucinations, delusions and impaired thinking and emotions.   Normally, pruning gets rid of excess connections we no longer need, streamlining our brain for optimal performance, but too much pruning can impair mental function,  explained Thomas Lehner, Ph.D., director of the Office of Genomics Research Coordination of the NIH s National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which co-funded the study along with the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute and other NIH components.  It could help explain schizophrenia s delayed age-of-onset of symptoms in late adolescence/early adulthood and shrinkage of the brain s working tissue. Interventions that put the brakes on this pruning process-gone-awry could prove transformative.  The gene, called C4 (complement component 4), sits in by far the tallest tower on schizophrenia s genomic  skyline   of more than 100 chromosomal sites harboring known genetic risk for the disorder. Affecting about 1 percent of the population, schizophrenia is known to be as much as 90 percent heritable, yet discovering how specific genes work to confer risk has proven elusive, until now. A team of scientists led by Steve McCarroll, Ph.D., of the Broad Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, leveraged the statistical power conferred by analyzing the genomes of 65,000 people, 700 postmortem brains, and the precision of mouse genetic engineering to discover the secrets of schizophrenia s strongest known genetic risk.  C4 s role represents the most compelling evidence, to date, linking specific gene versions to a biological process that could cause at least some cases of the illness.  Since schizophrenia was first described over a century ago, its underlying biology has been a black box, in part because it has been virtually impossible to model the disorder in cells or animals,  said McCarroll.  The human genome is providing a powerful new way in to this disease. Understanding these genetic effects on risk is a way of prying open that block box, peering inside and starting to see actual biological mechanisms.  A swath of chromosome 6 encompassing several genes known to be involved in immune function emerged as the strongest signal associated with schizophrenia risk in genome-wide analyses by the NIMH-funded Psychiatric Genomics Consortium(link is external) over the past several years. Yet conventional genetics failed to turn up any specific gene versions there linked to schizophrenia. To discover how the immune-related site confers risk for the mental disorder, McCarroll s team mounted a search for  cryptic genetic influences  that might generate  unconventional signals.  C4, a gene with known roles in immunity, emerged as a prime suspect because it is unusually variable across individuals.  It is not unusual for people to have different numbers of copies of the gene and distinct DNA sequences that result in the gene working differently. The researchers dug deeply into the complexities of how such structural variation relates to the gene s level of expression and how that, in turn, might relate to schizophrenia. They discovered structurally distinct versions that affect expression of two main forms of the gene in the brain. The more a version resulted in expression of one of the forms, called C4A, the more it was associated with schizophrenia.

This is also true of most mental disorders. ""We now understand that each gene mutation has a specific effect, which adds to other effects to draw a unique picture of the disease in each patient,"" said Dr. S bastien Jacquemont, a geneticist who sees on a daily basis children who are referred to him for a potential genetic diagnosis of mental disorder such as autism. To understand this additive effect, a precise quantification of the effect each identified mutation has in these patients is necessary. ""We have just discovered, for example, that a missing copy of a region in chromosome 16 results in a 25-point intelligence quotient (IQ) drop in carriers. Addition of a copy in the same genomic region results in an approximate 16-point drop. Strangely enough, even if carriers show much differentiated sets of symptoms - and sometimes no symptoms at all - the specific effect of these two mutations seems to remain the same,"" said Jacquemont, who is a clinical researcher at CHU Sainte-Justine, the mother-child hospital affiliated to University of Montreal, where he is also professor.  To reach these conclusions, the researchers measured the intelligence of 700 family members who had at least one relative carrying the same genetic mutation on chromosome 16, which is known to predispose to autistic spectrum disorders. Even in study participants whose IQ was considered to be normal, the researchers found a substantial 25 points IQ drop induced by 16p11.2 gene deletions. Indeed, it is quite common for mutation carriers to show no mental health problems. ""Intellectual faculties are the sum of many factors, the majority of which are genetic and inherited from parents. Each first-degree relative - parents and offspring, siblings - has 50% of their genetic code in common and therefore 50% of the genetic factors that partially determine cognition,"" said Dr. Jacquemont. Studying families thus enabled the researchers to measure the factors that combine with the mutations which effects they wanted to quantify. ""For example, depending on the additional factors involved, a 25-point IQ drop can determine whether or not a person has crossed the threshold of 'intellectual disability."" Further studies are needed to quantify the effect of all mutations associated with autism and characterize the additive effects that lead to this psychiatric disorder. ""No single mutation can cause the whole set of clinical signs shown by these patients,"" concludes the scientist.","Published: January 28, 2016"

The result offers hope that eye diseases might one day be treated by personalized, precision medicine in which patients' own cells are used to grow replacement tissue. With the aim of repairing the deteriorating retina in patients with an inherited blinding disease, X-linked Retinitis Pigmentosa (XLRP), Alexander Bassuk, MD, PhD, and Vinit Mahajan, MD, PhD, led a team of researchers who generated stem cells from patient skin cells and then repaired the damaged gene. The editing technique is so precise it corrected a single DNA change that had damaged the RPGR gene. More importantly, the corrected tissue had been derived from the patient's own stem cells, and so could potentially be transplanted without the need for harmful drugs to prevent tissue rejection. ""With CRISPR gene editing of human stem cells, we can theoretically transplant healthy new cells that come from the patient after having fixed their specific gene mutation, "" says Mahajan, clinical assistant professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences in the UI Carver College of Medicine. ""And retinal diseases are a perfect model for stem cell therapy, because we have the advanced surgical techniques to implant cells exactly where they are needed."" The study was a ""proof-of-concept"" experiment showing it is possible not only to repair a rare gene mutation, but that it can be done in patient stem cells. Use of stem cells is key because they can be re-programmed into retinal cells. The CRISPR technology was able to correct the RPGR mutation in 13 percent of the stem cells, which is a practically workable correction rate. Bassuk notes this result is particularly encouraging because the gene mutation sits in a highly repetitive sequence of the RPGR gene where it can be tricky to discriminate one region from another. In fact, initially determining the DNA sequence in this part of the gene was challenging. It was not clear that CRISPR/Cas9 would be able to home in on and correct the ""point mutation."" ""We didn't know before we started if we were going to be able to fix the mutation,"" says Bassuk, associate professor in the Stead Family Department of Pediatrics at University of Iowa Children's Hospital. Developed just three years ago, CRISPR/Cas9 has been heralded as a major breakthrough in genetic engineering, allowing scientists to easily, precisely, and relatively cheaply make specific alterations to the DNA in cells and experimental animals. The technology has not yet been used in humans, so safety concerns remain about the potential for unanticipated genetic changes. Also, ethical concerns arise given this technique's capability to make permanent genetic changes in sperm and egg cells. Nevertheless, the possibility of being able to fix diseased genes has tremendous potential. ""There is still work to do,"" says Stephen Tsang MD, PhD, a collaborator and associate professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Medical Center. ""Before we go into patients, we want to make sure we are only changing that particular single mutation and we are not making other alterations to the genome."" Bassuk adds, ""I think there is hope in real time for patients with this particular retinal degenerative disease.""","Published: January 28, 2016"

As of yet, however, scientists have been challenged to leverage biosensors for use in eukaryotic cells   which comprise yeast, plants and animals   because strategies-to-date are limited in the molecules they can detect and the signals they can produce. But now, a team of researchers at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University and Harvard Medical School (HMS) led by George Church, Ph.D., has developed a new method for engineering a broad range of biosensors to detect and signal virtually any desired molecule using living eukaryotic cells. Church, who is a Wyss Core Faculty member and the Robert Winthrop Professor of Genetics at HMS. To test their new method, the team experimentally engineered yeast, plant, and mammalian cells to contain customizable ligand-binding domains (LBDs), which are receptors for hormones and other types of small molecules. These custom LBDs are tailored so that they only bind and ""detect"" a specific molecule of interest, such as the human hormone progesterone or the drug digoxin. Once the LBD binds to the target molecule, a secondary  signal  component fused to the LBD can be programmed to emit fluorescence or regulate gene expression. The components of this biosensor   the LBD in combination with the fluorescent or genetic signal   degrade and fade away if the target molecule is not identified. Strikingly, the team successfully engineered Arabidopsis plants to act as multicellular botanical biosensors, containing a custom LBD to recognize the drug digoxin and a luminescent signal protein to emit light when digoxin is ""detected"". These Arabidopsis biosensors gave off fluorescence when the plants were exposed to digoxin, proving that whole organisms can visually light up to signal detection of an arbitrary molecule. ""Like many eukaryotic organisms, plants are full of diverse hormones that make it challenging to sense and respond to a specific hormone of interest,"" said Dan Mandell, Ph.D., the study s co-first author and a Wyss Institute Technology Development Fellow and Postdoctoral Research Fellow at HMS. ""But using our strategy, the Arabidopsis plants we engineered exhibited a 50-fold increase in luminescence in the presence of digoxin   very easily visualized   which could inspire exciting future applications involving trees or plants that detect harmful environmental pollutants or toxins and give off a visible indicator."" ""Biosensors that can tell you about their environment are extremely useful for a broad range of applications,"" said Church. ""You can imagine if they were used in agricultural plants, they can tell you about the condition of the soil, the presence of toxins or pests that are bothering them."" The team not only demonstrated its novel methodology in plants but also described its efficacy in turning yeast and mammalian cells into precise biosensors, which could one day be leveraged for use in industries that rely on the productivity of yeast or livestock, or for use as medical sensors. Overall, the method is extremely tunable and portable, meaning it can be used in a wide variety of organisms to detect a broad range of small molecules. An additional capability of the new biosensing methodology is the ability to connect it to gene regulators instead of fluorescent proteins. Such biosensors could precisely regulate gene transcription in order to improve yields of small molecules in organisms used for industrial bioproduction. Yeast, for example, could therefore be engineered to produce a desired molecule from a renewable feedstock, and furthermore programmed to self-identify the most efficient individuals within a population of producers so that only the highest producing yeast would survive. In this way, a population of organisms leveraged for bioproduction of pharmaceuticals or other valuable molecules could quickly self-evolve to become extremely efficient and productive. The team in fact used this strategy to evolve yeast that can produce the hormone progesterone with several-fold higher yield. The biosensors could have a direct impact on human health as well, given that the team also used their method to tightly regulate the gene editing mechanism CRISPR-Cas9 inside living human cells, a step towards preventing unintended changes to the genome during gene therapy. ""These new reprogramming capabilities developed by the Church team open up an entirely new realm where ordinary organisms can be transformed into extraordinary living cellular devices that can sense specific signals and produce appropriate responses, whether its enhancing production of biofuels or secreting a therapeutic when the cells sense inflammation or infection. It s another great enabling capability that will undoubtedly advance the entire field of synthetic biology.,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at HMS and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, as well as Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A.

But a handheld, miniature microscope being developed by University of Washington mechanical engineers could allow surgeons to  see  at a cellular level in the operating room and determine where to stop cutting. The new technology, developed in collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Stanford University and the Barrow Neurological Institute, is outlined in a recently published paper.   Surgeons don t have a very good way of knowing when they re done cutting out a tumor,  said senior author Jonathan Liu, UW assistant professor of mechanical engineering.  They re using their sense of sight, their sense of touch, pre-operative images of the brain   and oftentimes it s pretty subjective.  Being able to zoom and see at the cellular level during the surgery would really help them to accurately differentiate between tumor and normal tissues and improve patient outcomes,  said Liu. The handheld microscope, roughly the size of a pen, combines technologies in a novel way to deliver high-quality images at faster speeds than existing devices. Researchers expect to begin testing it as a cancer-screening tool in clinical settings next year. For instance, dentists who find a suspicious-looking lesion in a patient s mouth often wind up cutting it out and sending it to a lab to be biopsied for oral cancer. Most come back benign. That process subjects patients to an invasive procedure and overburdens pathology labs. A miniature microscope with high enough resolution to detect changes at a cellular level could be used in dental or dermatological clinics to better assess which lesions or moles are normal and which ones need to be biopsied.  The microscope technologies that have been developed over the last couple of decades are expensive and still pretty large, about the size of a hair dryer or a small dental x-ray machine,  said co-author Milind Rajadhyaksha, associate faculty member in the dermatology service at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.  So there s a need for creating much more miniaturized microscopes.  Making microscopes smaller, however, usually requires sacrificing some aspect of image quality or performance such as resolution, field of view, depth, imaging contrast or processing speed.  We feel like this device does one of the best jobs ever   compared to existing commercial devices and previous research devices   of balancing all those tradeoffs,  said Liu. The miniature microscope uses an innovative approach called  dual-axis confocal microscopy  to illuminate and more clearly see through opaque tissue. It can capture details up to a half millimeter beneath the tissue surface, where some types of cancerous cells originate. In the video below, for instance, researchers produced images of fluorescent blood vessels in a mouse ear at various depths ranging from 0.075 to 0.125 millimeters deep.  Trying to see beneath the surface of tissue is like trying to drive in a thick fog with your high beams on   you really can t see much in front of you,  Liu said.  But there are tricks we can play to see more deeply into the fog, like a fog light that illuminates from a different angle and reduces the glare.  The microscope also employs a technique called line scanning to speed up the image-collection process. It uses micro-electrical-mechanical   also known as MEMS   mirrors to direct an optical beam which scans the tissue, line by line, and quickly builds an image. Imaging speed is particularly important for a handheld device, which has to contend with motion jitter from the human using it. If the imaging rate is too slow, the images will be blurry. In the paper, the researchers demonstrate that the miniature microscope has sufficient resolution to see subcellular details. Images taken of mouse tissues compare well with those produced from a multi-day process at a clinical pathology lab   the gold standard for identifying cancerous cells in tissues. The researchers hope that after testing the microscope s performance as a cancer- screening tool, it can be introduced into surgeries or other clinical procedures within the next 2 to 4 years.  For brain tumor surgery, there are often cells left behind that are invisible to the neurosurgeon. This device will really be the first to let you identify these cells during the operation and determine exactly how much further you can reduce this residual,  said project collaborator Nader Sanai, professor of neurosurgery at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix.  That s not possible to do today. ","Published: January 28, 2016"

The findings, published in the online journal eLife, could aid in the search for new or improved treatments for patients with AIDS, or to the development of preventive strategies. ""We have identified the molecular mechanisms by which the Tat protein made by HIV interacts with the host cell to activate or repress several hundred human genes,  said Dr. Iv n D Orso, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at UT Southwestern and senior author of the study.  The findings clearly suggest that blocking Tat activity may be of therapeutic value to HIV patients.  It has long been known that HIV causes AIDS by hijacking the body s immune cells, transforming them into HIV factories and killing other immune cells that normally fight disease. HIV also hides in cells and continues to undermine the host s immune system despite antiretroviral therapy that has improved the outlook of those with AIDS. The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2012, estimated 1.2 million Americans were living with HIV, including 156,300 whose infections had not been diagnosed. About 50,000 people in the U.S. are newly infected with HIV annually, the CDC projects. In 2013, the CDC estimated that over 26,000 Americans had the advanced form of HIV infection, AIDS. Like all retroviruses, HIV has very few genes of its own and must take over the host s cellular machinery in order to propagate and spread throughout the body. Although the broad aspects of that cellular hijacking were known, the nuances remain to be explored, Dr. D Orso said.  We observed that HIV methodically and precisely manipulates the host s genes and cellular machinery. We also observed that HIV rewires cellular defensive pathways to benefit survival of the virus,  he added. The study provides insights into HIV s ability to survive despite antiretroviral therapy, findings that could lead to new therapeutic targets or ways to make current therapies more effective, he said.  Our study indicates that this small viral protein, Tat, directly binds to about 400 human genes to generate an environment in which HIV can thrive. Then, this protein precisely turns off the body s immune defense. It is striking that such a small viral protein has such a large impact,  Dr. D Orso said.  The human genes and pathways that Tat manipulates correlate well with symptoms observed in these patients, such as immune system hyperactivation, then weakening, and accelerated aging,  Dr. D Orso said, describing the situation in which HIV infection leads to AIDS. Italy s National Institute of Health in Rome recently completed a phase II clinical trial of an experimental vaccine that targets the Tat protein. That trial, which followed 87 HIV-positive patients for up to three years, reported that the vaccine was well-tolerated without significant side effects. However, it will take several years to determine if the vaccine works, Dr. D Orso said. Although someone can have HIV for years without showing symptoms, AIDS occurs when HIV blocks the body s ability to fight off illness. The person then becomes overrun by the opportunistic infections and specific cancers that are hallmarks of AIDS.","Published: January 28, 2016"

People with the illness show fewer such connections synapses between neurons. The gene switched on more in people with the suspect versions, who faced a higher risk of developing the disorder, characterized by hallucinations, delusions and impaired thinking and emotions. See Also: Protein findings open new avenues to understanding and treatment of schizophrenia ""Normally, pruning gets rid of excess connections we no longer need, streamlining our brain for optimal performance, but too much pruning can impair mental function,"" explained Thomas Lehner, PhD, director of the Office of Genomics Research Coordination of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which co-funded the study along with the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute and other NIH components. ""It could help explain schizophrenia's delayed age-of-onset of symptoms in late adolescence/early adulthood and shrinkage of the brain's working tissue. Interventions that put the brakes on this pruning process-gone-awry could prove transformative."" The gene, called C4 (complement component 4), sits in by far the tallest tower on schizophrenia's genomic ""skyline"" (see graph above) of more than 100 chromosomal sites harboring known genetic risk for the disorder. Affecting about 1 percent of the population, schizophrenia is known to be as much as 90 percent heritable, yet discovering how specific genes work to confer risk has proven elusive, until now. A team of scientists led by Steve McCarroll, PhD, of the Broad Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, leveraged the statistical power conferred by analyzing the genomes of 65,000 people, 700 postmortem brains, and the precision of mouse genetic engineering to discover the secrets of schizophrenia's strongest known genetic risk. C4's role represents the most compelling evidence, to date, linking specific gene versions to a biological process that could cause at least some cases of the illness. ""Since schizophrenia was first described over a century ago, its underlying biology has been a black box, in part because it has been virtually impossible to model the disorder in cells or animals,"" said McCarroll. ""The human genome is providing a powerful new way in to this disease. Understanding these genetic effects on risk is a way of prying open that block box, peering inside and starting to see actual biological mechanisms."" McCarroll's team, including Harvard colleagues Beth Stevens, Ph.D., Michael Carroll, PhD, and Aswin Sekar, report on their findings in the journal Nature. A swath of chromosome 6 encompassing several genes known to be involved in immune function emerged as the strongest signal associated with schizophrenia risk in genome-wide analyses by the NIMH-funded Psychiatric Genomics Consortium over the past several years. Yet conventional genetics failed to turn up any specific gene versions there linked to schizophrenia. To discover how the immune-related site confers risk for the mental disorder, McCarroll's team mounted a search for ""cryptic genetic influences"" that might generate ""unconventional signals."" C4, a gene with known roles in immunity, emerged as a prime suspect because it is unusually variable across individuals. It is not unusual for people to have different numbers of copies of the gene and distinct DNA sequences that result in the gene working differently. Learn More: Retinal changes may serve as measures of brain pathology in schizophrenia The researchers dug deeply into the complexities of how such structural variation relates to the gene's level of expression and how that, in turn, might relate to schizophrenia. They discovered structurally distinct versions that affect expression of two main forms of the gene in the brain. The more a version resulted in expression of one of the forms, called C4A, the more it was associated with schizophrenia. The more a person had the suspect versions, the more C4 switched on and the higher their risk of developing schizophrenia. Moreover, in the human brain, the C4 protein turned out to be most prevalent in the cellular machinery that supports connections between neurons. Adapting mouse molecular genetics techniques for studying synaptic pruning and C4's role in immune function, the researchers also discovered a previously unknown role for C4 in brain development.

Although our thinking organ excels in displaying amazing flexibility and plasticity, typically different areas of the brain take over different tasks. While words and language are mainly being processed in the left hemisphere, the right hemisphere is responsible for numerical reasoning. According to previous findings, this division of labor originates from the fact that the first steps in the processing of letters and numbers are also located individually in the different hemispheres. But this is not the case, at least not when it comes to the visual processing of numbers. See Also: Turkish whistling makes asymmetries in the brain disappear Neuroscientists of the Friedrich Schiller University (FSU) Jena and of the Jena University Hospital discovered that the visual processing of numbers takes place in a so-called 'visual number form area' (NFA) in fact in both hemispheres alike. The Jena scientists were the first to publish high resolution magnetic resonance recordings showing the activity in this region of the brain of healthy test persons. The area is normally difficult to get access to. In their study Dr. Mareike Grotheer and Prof. Dr. Gyula Kov cs from the Institute for Psychology of Jena University as well as Dr. Karl-Heinz Herrmann from the Department of Radiology (IDIR) of the Jena University Hospital presented subjects with numbers, letters and pictures of everyday objects. Meanwhile the participants' brain activity was recorded using magnetic resonance imaging. Thus the researchers were able to clearly identify the region in which the visual processing of numbers takes place. The small area at the underside of the left and right temporal lobe reacted with increased activity at the presentation of numbers. Letters and other images but also false numbers lead to a significantly lower brain activity in this area.

And here is why: Hidden underneath the ear and the acoustic meatus, surrounded by bone and air, previous MRI scans showed a number of artefacts and thus obstructed detailed research.

Research has shown that children born prematurely are at an increased risk for neurodevelopmental impairments. The prevalence of severe disabilities among preterm children is diminishing thanks to advances in medical care, but mild impairments remain and tend to persist into later childhood, posing challenges for children in their everyday home and school lives. See Also: Subtle but important memory function affected by preterm birth Studies suggest that 40 to 70 percent of preterm children have minor neurodevelopmental impairments, including cognitive delays, speech and language disorders, and mild motor problems such as issues with coordination and balance. They also may have lower adaptive behavior, or the integrated ability of cognitive skills, motor skills, and social and emotional regulation people learn in order to function day-to-day. ""A better understanding of risk factors for impairments among preterm children can help health care providers develop a prevention plan when a child is still young, and identify those who might benefit from early intervention,"" said study author Tsu-Hsin Howe, associate professor of occupational therapy at NYU Steinhardt. In their study, published in Research in Developmental Disabilities, Howe and her colleagues examined predictors of neurodevelopmental outcomes in very low birth weight children at five years of age, and looked at the contribution of early cognitive and motor assessments to preterm children's later developmental outcomes. The study participants included 126 children in Taiwan who were born prematurely (at or before 32 weeks) with very low birth weight (less than or equal to 1500 grams, or approximately 3.3 pounds), and were five years old at the time of the study. The children had no severe disabilities or major medical issues. The five-year-olds were evaluated using neurodevelopmental assessments to determine their overall cognitive function and motor performance. Additional information was collected from their parents, including demographic data and a survey of the children's adaptive behaviors. Learn More: EPO: Protecting brains of very preterm infants The researchers then examined whether certain indicators prenatal factors, social factors, or results of early neurodevelopmental assessments would assist in predicting the children's later developmental outcomes. They found that more than 50 percent of intelligence and 30 percent of both motor performance and adaptive behavior can be explained by four factors: preterm children's medical complications at birth, maternal education, early motor assessments, and early cognitive assessments.

Biologics refer to a new class of therapeutics, including monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, which are increasingly being used for the treatment and prevention of human diseases. Unlike conventional drugs that are chemically synthesized, biologics are produced using cell cultures and represent an increasing growth area due to its potential to treat a range of conditions with no treatments available presently. While biologics hold great therapeutic benefits, much effort and cost is needed to purify these drugs, to eliminate residual components of the host cell system used in manufacturing. These components, or host cell proteins, may elicit unpredictable immune responses in patients or compromise the stability of the product. The collaboration aims to meet the needs of the biopharmaceutical industry in developing accurate and high-throughput methods for analysis of these contaminants, to help the industry validate therapeutic candidates and ensure the safety and efficacy of biologics according to established regulatory guidelines. Under the collaboration agreement, SCIEX will provide BTI with their reliable, sensitive and intuitive instruments including theTripleTOF  6600 system and a Nano LC system, along with SCIEX software, and support from a team of application experts to assist with the analysis of complex contaminant protein molecules related to the production and analysis of biologic drugs. BTI will supply SCIEX with data and validation results of methods developed in the course of the collaboration, while comprehensively profiling the host cell proteins or contaminants using the collaboration instruments. BTI will closely work with SCIEX s demo chemists, applications chemists, and other concerned parties in the application of the methods developed. ""As Singapore is a recognised biomedical and biomanufacturing hub in the Asia Pacific, it gives us pride and honour to form this collaboration with an institute such as BTI who is spearheading innovative research in a very exciting and fast growing field like Biologics. Ultimately, by sharing our expertise and highly qualified resources, our analytical tools and solutions, and collaborating with BTI researchers, new methods and analyses will be developed in the quest to find treatments to new diseases, that will effectively improve people's lives,"" said Jean-Paul Mangeolle, President of SCIEX. Professor Lam Kong Peng, Executive Director of BTI, said, ""We see an increasing demand for new and innovative protein drugs that target diseases and are safer for patients. BTI will continue to work with industry partners such as SCIEX, combining our expertise in the production and analysis of biologics with the use of industry-leading high performance mass spectrometry instruments, to advance research in this area. We intend for our research to result in outcomes that can improve human health, meet the needs of the biopharmaceutical industry and enhance Singapore s reputation as a world-class destination for biopharmaceutical R&D and manufacturing.""","Published: January 27, 2016"

Conducted by scientists at the Institute for EthnoMedicine, a non-profit medical research organization, and the University of Miami Brain Endowment Bank, the study provides a foundation for future research in Alzheimer's disease, ALS and Parkinson's disease. Brain tangles and amyloid deposits are the hallmarks of both Alzheimer's disease and an unusual illness suffered by Chamorro villagers on the Pacific Island of Guam, whose diet is contaminated by the environmental toxin BMAA. Pacific Islanders with this unusual condition also suffer from dementia and symptoms similar to Alzheimer's disease, ALS and Parkinson's disease. The cause of neurodegenerative disease remains largely unknown, and the role of environmental factors in these illnesses is poorly understood. However, scientists have suspected a link between BMAA, a neurotoxin found in some harmful algal blooms, and neurodegenerative illness. ""Our findings show that chronic exposure to BMAA can trigger Alzheimer's-like brain tangles and amyloid deposits,"" said Paul Alan Cox, Ph.D., an ethnobotanist at the Institute for EthnoMedicine and lead author of the study. ""As far as we are aware, this is the first time researchers have been able to successfully produce brain tangles and amyloid deposits in an animal model through exposure to an environmental toxin."" Researchers conducted two experiments on vervets that lasted for 140 days. In the first experiment, vervets fed fruit dosed with BMAA developed neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid deposits similar to Pacific Islanders who died from the disease. Vervets fed equal amounts of L-BMAA and the dietary amino acid L-serine had a reduced density of tangles. Vervets fed a placebo dose did not develop neuropathology. A replication experiment was conducted which added a BMAA dose closer to the amount Chamorro villagers would be exposed to over a lifetime. The first group received fruit containing L-BMAA, the second group received fruit containing one-tenth of the regular dose of L-BMAA, the third group received fruit containing equal amounts of L-BMAA and L-serine, and the fourth group received fruit containing a placebo. ""This study takes a leap forward in showing causality -- that BMAA causes disease,"" said Deborah Mash, Ph.D., director of the University of Miami Brain Endowment Bank and co-author of the study. ""The tangles and amyloid deposits produced were nearly identical to those found in the brain tissue of the Pacific Islanders who died from the Alzheimer's-like disease."" After 140 days, tangles and amyloid deposits were found in the brain tissues of all of the vervets who consumed BMAA. However, there was a significant reduction in the density of tangles in those that consumed equal amounts of L-serine. Cox does not advocate patients taking L-serine at this time. ""The FDA has not approved its use for the treatment of neurodegenerative illness, and much more research is needed,"" he said. ""However, this new animal model may prove useful in evaluating other potential new Alzheimer's drugs."" The Institute has sponsored FDA-approved human clinical trials to study the effects of the naturally-occurring amino acid L-serine in people with ALS, and is working with Dartmouth Medical School to begin a Phase I human clinical trial of L-serine for patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or early stage Alzheimer's disease.","Published: January 27, 2016"

The addition of Conexio products and people solidify our HLA capabilities and demonstrate Illumina s ongoing commitment to HLA and ultimately, to the field of transplant science,  said Alex Lindell, Associate Director, Market Development for HLA at Illumina.  We look forward to working with the Conexio team to enhance our HLA offerings.  Illumina s partnership with Conexio started in early 2015 with the launch of the TruSight HLA Solution, for which Conexio s Assign software provides analysis and reporting. Conexio Genomics, based in Fremantle, Western Australia, was founded in 2002 by Dr. David Sayer and Dr. Damian Goodridge. Their innovations were instrumental in kick-starting the sequencing era for HLA typing. Together with their team, Conexio has since introduced a complete line of sample-to-report products for genotyping HLA genes with both Sanger sequencing and NGS. The acquisition enables Illumina to develop NGS-based transplant diagnostics assays, including a new solution for interrogating genomic variants in the gamma genomic block of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Initial studies provide strong evidence that matching for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gamma block is correlated with a reduced risk of severe acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) in patients receiving bone marrow transplants.  We are excited to combine our deep knowledge and experience of HLA and MHC genetics with Illumina s industry-leading NGS technology,  said Dr. Sayer, formerly the CEO of Conexio Genomics.

Macrolides appear also to contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. It is already known that early-life use of antibiotics is connected to increased risk of immune-mediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma, as well as obesity. The effect is thought to be mediated by the intestinal microbes, since antibiotics in animal studies has been found to change the composition of the intestinal microbiota and reduce biodiversity. However, to date there is no information on the long-term effects of antibiotics on children s microbiota. The study, conducted at the University of Helsinki and led by Professor Willem de Vos, included 142 Finnish children, aged 2 to 7 years. Researchers investigated how many courses of antibiotics the children had received in their lifetime and how the use of antibiotics was reflected in their intestinal microbiota. In addition, they investigated the association between use of antibiotics and asthma and body mass index.  The results showed that children s intestinal microbiota composition clearly reflected the use of antibiotics. Antibiotics reduced the bacterial species richness and slowed the age-driven microbiota development. Particularly the microbiota of the children who had received macrolide antibiotics, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin, within the past two years differed from normal. The less time had passed since the macrolide course, the larger were the anomalies in the microbiota.  In general, it seems that the gut microbiota recovery from antibiotic treatment lasts more than a year. If a child gets repeated courses of antibiotics during their first years, the microbiota may not have time to fully recover , says the researcher, Katri Korpela, whose doctoral thesis project includes the newly published research. The use of macrolides was associated with microbiota features, which have previously been associated with obesity and metabolic diseases. The use of macrolides during the first two years of life was associated with increased body mass index. Heavy use of macrolides in the first two years of life was also associated with an increased risk of asthma later in life. Macrolides appear to promote also the development of antibiotic resistance, as the resistance to these antibiotics was elevated in the microbiota of children who had used them.  Penicillin-type antibiotics seemed to have a weaker impact on the composition and functioning of the microbiome than macrolides , Korpela says. The results support the recommendation to avoid macrolides as the primary antibiotic, and generally restrict the use of antibiotics to genuine need. Antibiotics should not be used to treat self-limiting infections and never  just in case , the researchers emphasize.","Published: January 27, 2016"

The study involved using blood samples from people who had survived the Ebola Bundibugyo strain. When someone has survived an Ebola infection, they have developed antibodies. The question is, can these antibodies protect against a future infection with the virus and related filoviruses? Although several mouse antibody-based treatments have provided protection against Ebola Zaire in animal models, there are no available therapeutics based on antibodies from human survivors and no universal treatments against multiple filoviruses, including Ebola Sudan and Ebola Bundibugyo. In the study, researchers used the blood of seven people who survived Ebola Bundibugyo virus infection during the 2007 outbreak in Uganda to isolate a large number of B cells that produce antibodies, which are the small protein molecules capable of inactivating the virus.  The work on antibodies isolated from survivors of filovirus infections, including Marburg and Ebola, was started by James Crowe s laboratory at Vanderbilt University together with our laboratory about 3 years ago,  said virologist Alex Bukreyev, professor at UTMB and co-corresponding author.  In this study, we isolated a remarkably diverse array of virus-specific antibodies, which appeared to bind to various parts of the envelope protein of the virus. Some of the antibodies neutralized not only Ebola Bundibugyo virus, but also Ebola Zaire and Sudan viruses.   The quality of these naturally occurring human antibodies as biological drugs to treat the virus infection is remarkable, and we are doubly encouraged because they recognize multiple species of Ebola,  said immunologist James Crowe, Director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center. A portion of the isolated antibodies effectively protected mice and guinea pigs against a lethal Ebola Zaire infection.  These data provide the basis for understanding the immune response to filovirus infections in humans,  said Bukreyev.

The findings are considered a positive step towards development of life-saving therapeutics to treat patients. The bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila has been increasingly acknowledged as being responsible for necrotizing fasciitis, a rapidly-progressing skin and muscle tissue infection. The microbe is commonly found in fresh and brackish water, especially during warmer months. The infection can be acquired through cuts and scrapes in the skin. The bacteria liquefies muscle tissue and can spread to various organs. Severe cases may require amputation of limbs and death could occur, even after aggressive antibiotic treatment. Researchers studied a human case of necrotizing fasciitis and identified four strains of Aeromonas hydrophila that caused the infection. Three of the strains were closely related but one was different from the others. Researchers found that the three similar strains produced a toxin called ExoA that is responsible for breaking down muscle tissue, allowing the distinct strain to move to other parts of the body.  We provided evidence that presence of these multiple strains of Aeromonas hydrophila significantly influenced disease progression and outcome, more so than if only individual strains had been involved  said Chopra.  These four strains could be differentiated by using advanced laboratory technology but not by routine clinical procedures. What we found was that although mice were infected with all four strains, only one of the strains spread to the inner organs, namely the spleen and liver.  This discovery could alter the way medical researchers think about this and other bacterial diseases that are commonly thought to be caused by a single species of bacterium. New technology can now be used to discover infections caused by a mixture of bacterial strains of the same species and may well revolutionize clinical microbiology, directing physicians towards improved treatment options, said Chopra. This study was the first time scientists were able to determine the role that the ExoA toxin produced by the three similar strains of the bacteria plays in the infection process. Chopra said the plan is to extend analysis of these strains of Aeromonas hydrophila to find ways to prevent or lessen the toxin s ability to break down muscle tissue.","Published: January 27, 2016"

Late-stage liver cancer is a major challenge for therapeutic intervention. Drugs that show promise in healthy functioning livers can cause devastating toxicity in cirrhotic livers with cancer, the researchers explained. UT Southwestern scientists crafted synthetic  dendrimer  nanoparticles that are able to provide the tumor-suppressing effect without further damaging the liver or neighboring tissue. The findings appear in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  We have synthesized highly effective dendrimer carriers that can deliver drugs to tumor cells without adverse side effects, even when the cancerous liver is consumed by the disease,  said Dr. Daniel Siegwart, Assistant Professor of Biochemistry and with the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.  We found that efficacy required a combination of a small RNA drug that can suppress cancer growth and the carrier, thereby solving a critical issue in treating aggressive liver cancer and providing a guide for future drug development.  Primary liver cancer, a chronic consequence of liver disease, is a leading cause of cancer death and a major global health problem. Each year in the United States, about 20,000 men and 8,000 women get liver cancer, and the 5-year survival rate is only 17 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The percentage of Americans who get liver cancer has been rising slowly for several decades, with higher rates in Asians and in Hispanic and African-American men. Critical to understanding this problem, and developing the new therapy, was a close collaboration between Dr. Siegwart and Dr. Hao Zhu, Assistant Professor at the Children s Medical Center Research Institute at UT Southwestern, and a practicing oncologist.  Early-stage disease can be cured with surgery, but there are few options for cirrhotic patients with advanced liver cancers,  said Dr. Zhu, also Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics at UT Southwestern. The recent failure of five phase III human clinical trials of small-molecule drugs to treat hepatocellular carcinoma   the most common form of liver cancer   prompted the authors to develop non-toxic carriers and explore  miRNA  therapies as a promising alternative. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short nucleic acids that can function as natural tumor suppressors, but require delivery strategies to transport these large, anionic drugs into cells. To date, no existing carrier has been able to provide effective delivery to late-stage liver cancer without amplified toxicity, which negates the desired effect. To address this problem, UTSW scientists chemically synthesized more than 1,500 different types of nanoparticles, which allowed discovery of lead compounds that could function in the heavily compromised cancerous liver. Synthetic, man-made nanoscale compounds called dendrimers provided an opportunity to screen different combinations of chemical groups, physical properties, and molecular size, Dr. Siegwart said. This approach led to the identification of dendrimers to deliver miRNA to late-stage liver tumors with low liver toxicity. The study, conducted in genetic mouse models with a highly aggressive form of liver cancer, demonstrated that the miRNA nanoparticles inhibited tumor growth and dramatically extended survival. The multidisciplinary UTSW research team included Dr. Kejin Zhou, Liem Nguyen, Jason Miller, Dr. Yunfeng Yan, Dr. Petra Kos, Dr. Hu Xiong, Lin Li, Dr. Jing Hao, and Jonathan Minnig. The Siegwart Research Group uses a materials chemistry approach to tackle challenges in cancer therapy and diagnosis. The lab is currently focused on the development of improved materials for effective delivery of siRNA, miRNA, mRNA, and CRISPR strategies to manipulate gene expression in tumors and develop the next generation of cancer therapies.","Published: January 27, 2016"
6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/titan-targets-tumors-212134,Titan Targets Tumors German team makes large computational gains in laser driven radiation therapy of cancer  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Since lasers were first produced in the early 1960s, researchers have worked to apply laser technology from welding metal to surgeries, with laser technology advancing quickly through the last 50 years. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy all play important roles in cancer treatment, and sometimes the best successes come from combining all three approaches. Doctors usually do the most common form of radiation therapy with x-rays, which can penetrate tissue, killing the cancerous cells in deep-seated tumors. Unfortunately, these same x-rays can also damage healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. Thus, in recent years, the use of beams of heavy particles, such as protons or ions, has come into focus. These beams can deposit most of their energy inside the tumor, while at the same time leaving the healthy tissue unharmed. Unfortunately, these beams come from bulky particle accelerators, which make the treatment cost prohibitive for many patients. At the German research laboratory Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), researchers are looking into replacing particle accelerators with high-powered lasers. The electromagnetic fields of the laser can accelerate ions in a very short time, thus effectively reducing the distance needed to accelerate the ions to therapeutic energies from several meters to a few micrometers. As a scientist experienced in accelerator research and laser physics, HZDR researcher Michael Bussmann aims for understanding and controlling this new method of particle acceleration to make it available for patient treatment. ""I'm coming from accelerator research and laser physics, and what my team and I have been looking at is how we make best use of the high-power lasers so they can replace accelerators for applications like treating cancerous tumors,"" Bussmann said. ""This is fundamental physics on the one hand, as the laser pulse rips apart all the matter found in a target, usually a very thin metal foil or a tiny sphere, separating the building blocks of atoms--negatively charged electrons and positively charged atomic nuclei, ions--from each other. This state of matter is called a plasma,"" Bussmann explained. ""On the other hand, it has real applications as well. Simulations play a role that is unique, as experiments are still not very reproducible and we can't really diagnose what's happening in a few femtoseconds."" To observe these atomic-scale interactions happening many times per second, Bussmann's team is using the Cray XK7 Titan supercomputer located at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), a US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility located at DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Bussmann explained that without access to leadership-class supercomputing resources, his team would not be able to run such complex simulations efficiently. ""I need to simulate a huge volume of atoms over a very long time scale,"" Bussmann said. ""The only way to do this comes through supercomputing, because the large volume needs a lot of memory, and the long time scales mean I need a lot of computational power, and that is where the GPUs come into play."" Titan uses traditional CPUs along with high-speed GPUs, or graphics processing units, to accelerate simulations. Bussmann's team does all of its calculations on Titan's GPUs at a rate 10-100 times faster than what is possible on CPU-only machines. ""We no longer think of simulations in terms of CPU hours but rather frames per second,"" Bussmann said, describing the effect this speed-up has had on the team's research. Particles to laser pulses When using lasers to treat tumors, researchers must work within extremely small parameters. Typically, a team must aim a laser pulse at a target about the same size as the laser's focus -- no more than several micrometers long. Researchers then suspend a thin foil material; next, they use the laser to excite electrons connected to its atoms and drive the electrons away from the atoms. In the end, the strong separation of negatively charged electrons and now positively charged atoms, or ions, creates the forces that accelerate an ion beam toward the tumor. Until recently, lasers that provided pulses with enough power to reach high ion energies were large and costly. Now, new technologies such as energy efficient laser diodes--which help increase the laser power -- have made these systems much more compact. Moreover, as more of the electrical energy used to operate these lasers can be converted into laser light power, researchers can now take several hundred laser shots per minute. This is a huge gain compared with several shots per day that were possible with the first laser systems. With this gain, researchers can produce laser-accelerated ion beams at the rate needed for treating patients, reducing the potential treatment time to several minutes, thus saving costs and making the procedure easier for patients to endure. Still, researchers must perform extensive research not only to increase the energy of the ions to reach even deep seated tumors but also to really control the beam well enough to be used routinely in a medical treatment. Due to power demands, this technology is still in its infancy, and may require several years before it can be used in clinical applications. Ions are ideal to target the cancerous tissue precisely. Unlike x-rays, ions do not release a lot of their energy into the tissue before coming to their final stop inside the tumor. There, they release a sudden burst of remaining energy, depositing the lethal dose of radiation directly into the tumor. Using ion beams allows medical professionals to calculate exactly where ions need to stop; with precise aiming, they can kill only the tumor cells and spare the vast majority of nearby healthy cells. Successful student simulations In August 2008, the team got an unlikely boost in its computational capabilities in the form of 17 year old high school student Heiko Burau. He won a German ""Jugend forscht,"" or youth research award, allowing him to work with experts at a prestigious German research institution. This award allowed Burau to work with Bussmann's group, and the results were immediately noticeable-- within 6 weeks, the student GPU programmer had created the team's first GPU accelerated two-dimensional simulation. Burau is now starting his diploma thesis -- still as part of the HZDR team. Burau's initial work has been picked up by an ever-growing team of young researchers. Axel Huebl, who joined the team a year after Burau, has pushed the code to make optimal use of all of Titan's GPUs, winning him time on Titan through DOE's Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) program for his PhD research on laser-driven radiation therapy of cancer. The team has been developing its code, PIConGPU (particle in cell on graphics processing units) for 8 years, with undergraduate students doing much of the development work. Although some might see this as a sign of inexperience, Bussmann loves his team's youthful approach to problem solving. ""Our group is full of youth; otherwise we couldn't have done this research,"" Bussmann said. ""One of the main reasons is because we weren't afraid of doing it. If you're sure things are going to get rocky down the road, maybe an older group wouldn't go there, but we said, 'let's just give it a try,' and it worked out."" For its work on PIConGPU, the Bussmann team was named a finalist for the 2013 Gordon Bell Prize -- one of the most prestigious honors in supercomputing. In addition to student developers, OLCF veterans have also helped optimize PIConGPU for Titan. ORNL's Scientific Data Group, led by Scott Klasky, has helped the team drastically improve its ability to write out petabytes of data from the simulation and move it between Titan and other ORNL computing resources. To address I/O concerns, the team has been using the Adaptable I/O System, or ADIOS, developed by the Scientific Data Group. ADIOS has enabled a tenfold improvement for the team's I/O capabilities. ORNL visualization expert David Pugmire is also collaborating with the team to develop a full-scale visualization of its data, which is a huge help. ""We've done this kind of visualization on other projects, but that in itself is a huge effort. That's an area where we get help from Oak Ridge quite a lot, and we're impressed by how far this help goes,"" Bussmann said. Because of its various collaborations and diligent work on Titan, the team was able to create some of the most realistic three-dimensional simulations of high power laser interactions with targets that are on the scale of the laser focus. With the calculation power available, the team could use targets at densities close to what is used in experiments. Moreover, the team can include effects that happen on much longer time scales than the interaction of the laser pulse itself and that strongly influence the outcome of experiments. One of the main advances dealt with the creation of plasma caused by laser energy deposited into the target well before the main part of the laser pulse hits the target. This so-called preplasma can be much larger than the initial target, meaning the team has to simulate a much larger volume. These effects are present in experiments as well as in large-scale simulations, so the team is able to offer a much more detailed comparison between simulation and experiment. Though the team has made major advances using Titan, there is plenty of room for improvement. Bussmann noted that further improving the atomic-level physics in his team's simulations would help improve accuracy. Ideally, the team could use a database to describe every atom with each atom's respective electronic configurations. Describing billions of atomic level interactions in such small time scales, while also needing to reference the atomic database, is currently too computationally expensive. Summit, the OLCF's next-generation supercomputer, set to be delivered in 2018, will address some of these issues. ""Summit would be an almost ideal system for this task,"" Bussmann said. ""We could leverage the power of the CPU to go through the database quickly and bring the information we need to the GPUs using the very fast interconnects. Right now, we're basically relying on GPUs, but heterogeneous computing makes sense -- to let each part of the system do that part it's best at and let them work things out together.""","Published: January 27, 2016"

But in fact, that unlikely combination has just helped an international team make a key discovery about how the brain s  garbage disposal  process works   and how little needs to go wrong in order for it to break down. The findings show just how important a cell-cleanup process called autophagy is to our brains. It also demonstrates how even the tiniest genetic change can have profound effects on such an essential function. The new understanding could lead to better treatments for people whose brain and nerve cells have troubles  taking out the trash.  Some such drugs already exist, but more could follow. FOLLOWING A MYSTERY TO ITS END In a new paper in the online journal eLife, the team describes their painstaking effort to figure out what was wrong in the Turkish siblings, and to understand what it meant. The children have a rare condition called ataxia that makes it harder for them to walk. They also have intellectual disability and developmental delays. Ataxia is rare   affecting about one in every 20,000 people   and can cause movement problems in people who develop it in adulthood, or a range of symptoms when it arises in children. Because researchers from the University of Michigan Medical School had published studies about families with multiple cases of ataxia before, Turkish researchers got in touch with them when the children s parents brought them in for treatment. That started a long chain of scientific sleuthing that led to today s publication. First, the U-M team studied samples of the children s DNA, and used advanced methods to pinpoint the exact genetic mutation that caused their symptoms. It turned out to be on one of the genes that scientists know play a key role in autophagy, called ATG5. Cells throughout the body trigger their internal garbage crews by turning on this gene and its partners, and using them to make proteins that help clean up the cell.   The junk that these garbage crews clean up includes botched proteins   ones that have been used up or weren t made right in the first place. In fact, many forms of ataxia (and lots of other diseases) are caused by genetic problems that result in brain and nerve cells making such damaged, misfolded proteins. The proteins build up inside cells, killing them and causing neurological problems. So, scientists and drug developers have tried to ramp up autophagy activity. They hope that by cleaning that cellular junk up faster, they can keep it from causing symptoms. TINY CHANGE   BIG EFFECTS But that tiny change was enough to alter the autophagy process, and keep the children s brain and nerve cells from working properly. And that s where the yeast and Hungarian flies come in. Using them, the researchers could see what the children s problem gene did   and what that meant for the autophagy process. That s because the autophagy process is so important that organisms ranging from yeast to humans make almost exactly the same ATG5 protein   it s what scientists call  highly conserved  across species. What they saw amazed them. The genetic mutation led cells to change just one link in the chain of amino acids that make up the ATG5 protein. The new amino acid even had the same electrical charge as the usual one. But that one changed link happened to be at the exact spot where ATG5 and its partner, called ATG12, connect to one another. Since the two crucial autophagy partners couldn t link together as usual, the children s cells   and the yeast and flies  cells   couldn t clean up their cellular trash nearly as well. Autophagy didn t shut down completely, but less of it happened. And the fruit flies, like the children, had problems walking.  This is a window into the autophagy system, and the first time where having less autophagy causes ataxia, developmental delays and intellectual disability,  says Margit Burmeister, Ph.D. the U-M neurogeneticist who led the research and is co-senior author on the new paper.  It s a subtle change, but it shows how important autophagy is in neurological disorders.  Burmeister and colleagues from the University of Michigan, St. Jude Children s Research Hospital, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Istanbul University and Bogazici University in Istanbul and E tv s Lor nd University in Budapest hope the findings lead to autophagy-related treatments. ""Our results demonstrate autophagy's critical role in preventing neurological diseases and maintaining neuronal health,"" says co-senior author Daniel Klionsky, Ph.D., a cell biologist who studies autophagy in his lab at the U-M Life Sciences Institute, and the Alexander G. Ruthven Professor of Life Sciences in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. Meanwhile, they re still working to understand how the change in ATG12 ATG5 binding actually changes autophagy. They re looking at cells made with the mutations from other ataxia patients to see if autophagy is also changed. They re also looking for more families with ataxias. Each family could hold clues as important as the Turkish children s mutation did. In fact, Burmeister was in Turkey late in 2015 to work with colleagues to find more potential cases. Small villages with centuries of marriage among people with some relation to one another, and large families, can prove to be important to science. The acceleration in genetic sequencing and other testing, made possible in the last decade by advances in technology and scientific methods, means they ll get closer to answers faster. What once took years can now be done in a single year. Having the expertise concentrated at U-M in genetics, autophagy, fruit fly biology, cell biology and more made the work go even faster, says Burmeister.","Published: January 27, 2016"

Such cancer stem cells can migrate to other tissues and become fatal metastases. To fully cure a patient's cancer, it is crucial to find and eliminate all of these cells because any that escape can regenerate the tumor and trigger its spread through the body. Liang Fang and his colleagues in Walter Birchmeier's group at the Max Delbr ck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC), working with colleagues on the Berlin-Buch campus, have now discovered a molecule that interrupts biochemical signals essential for the survival of a certain type of cancer stem cell.  In their study Liang and his colleagues focused on a biochemical network within cells called the Wnt signaling pathway, which Birchmeier's lab has studied for many years. One of their discoveries has been that certain types of cancer stem cells require continual stimulation via this pathway to survive and maintain the properties that make them so dangerous. A component of the network called beta-catenin plays an essential role in transmitting Wnt signals to genes that promote the survival and reproduction of the cancer cells. In healthy cells there is no signal from Wnt, and beta-catenin is destroyed. ""In the absence of a signal, beta-catenin is locked out of the cell nucleus,"" Birchmeier says. ""It is linked to a complex of proteins that ultimately break it down. Normally it requires a signal to be released from this 'destruction complex,' and it travels to the cell nucleus."" There beta-catenin binds to transcription factors such as the protein TCF4, and in combination the molecules activate specific target genes. In cancer there is no signal, but defective cellular molecules behave as if they have received one and release beta-catenin from the complex. It might be possible, the scientists reasoned, to prevent this by interrupting the interaction between beta-catenin and TCF4 with a drug. Contacts between two proteins are normally very difficult to destabilize with the small molecules that make up drugs. Proteins usually bind over large areas of their surfaces, which means that a comparatively small obstacle won't prevent the interaction. That is the case with other beta-catenin binding partners. But the crucial points of contact between beta-catenin and TCF4 appeared to be small ""hotspots"" which suggested that an inhibitor might block it. Liang Fang took the problem to the campus Screening Unit and Medicinal Chemistry group, a partnership between the MDC and FMP. The facility has high-throughput technology platforms and a ""library"" of tens of thousands of substances that scientists use to search for inhibitors. The screen turned up a compound they called LF3 which very strongly inhibited binding. After showing that the compound stripped cancer stem cells of some properties essential to their survival, the lab's next step was to determine whether it would have any effect on tumors in living animals. The scientists turned to the company EPO, a campus-based spin-off of the MDC, to develop lines of mice with tumors derived from human colon cancer tissue. The company specializes in creating mouse models from individual patients' tumors, then testing the animals with a battery of known drugs in hopes of finding one that will effectively combat a specific case of cancer. In this case, all the animals developed tumors, even when injected with a relatively small number of enriched cancer cells. The animals were then treated with LF3. ""We observed a strong reduction of tumor growth,"" Walter Birchmeier says. ""What remained seemed to be completely devoid of cancer stem cells - LF3 seemed to be powerfully triggering these cells to differentiate into benign tissue. At the same time no signaling systems other than Wnt were disturbed. All of these factors make LF3 very promising to further develop as a lead compound, aiming for therapies that target tumors whose growth and survival depend on Wnt signaling.""","Published: January 27, 2016"

Both processes are highly regulated and coupled.  This coupling is similar to the coupling between a moving escalator and a person walking on it at the same time. The research takes a closer look at how the two coupled processes change in the cell responding to an outside stimulus.  Until recently, it has been very difficult to study these systems and researchers have thought that the movement of the escalator is most important during the cellular response,  Vogel explains.  We now show that is not necessarily the case, and under some circumstances, the person s walking determines the overall outcome.  In biology, this means that both of the processes to make RNAs and proteins play important roles, but with different patterns. In their study, the scientists, who also included researchers from National University Singapore and Berlin s Max Delbruck Center, took a closer look at how the two processes exactly respond over time. Their results showed notable distinctions between DNA and mRNA in the nature of their signaling. Notably, the process of making RNA from DNA was pulse-like a brief messaging over the studied period that returned to the normal levels by the end of the measurements. By contrast, the process of making a protein from RNA was akin to an on/off switch: once started, levels remained constant for consistent periods before reverting back to long stretches of dormancy. While the reasons for these differences in cell behavior remain unknown, the researchers believe the answer may lie in the nature of the two tasks.  It is very costly for the cell to make proteins, but making RNA messages from DNA is a relatively low-energy and simple process, so it makes sense that we see frequent, or pulsating, signaling at this stage,  observes Vogel.  By contrast, creating proteins is an intricate undertaking, requiring a great deal of time and energy. This may be why, once you decided to stop production of proteins, you do not turn it back on that easily and the other way around. ","Published: January 27, 2016"

Drugs that show promise in healthy functioning livers can cause devastating toxicity in cirrhotic livers with cancer, the researchers explained.   UT Southwestern scientists crafted synthetic  dendrimer  nanoparticles that are able to provide the tumor-suppressing effect without further damaging the liver or neighboring tissue.   We have synthesized highly effective dendrimer carriers that can deliver drugs to tumor cells without adverse side effects, even when the cancerous liver is consumed by the disease,  said Dr. Daniel Siegwart, Assistant Professor of Biochemistry and with the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.  We found that efficacy required a combination of a small RNA drug that can suppress cancer growth and the carrier, thereby solving a critical issue in treating aggressive liver cancer and providing a guide for future drug development.  Primary liver cancer, a chronic consequence of liver disease, is a leading cause of cancer death and a major global health problem. Each year in the United States, about 20,000 men and 8,000 women get liver cancer, and the 5-year survival rate is only 17 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The percentage of Americans who get liver cancer has been rising slowly for several decades, with higher rates in Asians and in Hispanic and African-American men. Critical to understanding this problem, and developing the new therapy, was a close collaboration between Dr. Siegwart and Dr. Hao Zhu, Assistant Professor at the Children s Medical Center Research Institute at UT Southwestern, and a practicing oncologist.  Early-stage disease can be cured with surgery, but there are few options for cirrhotic patients with advanced liver cancers,  said Dr. Zhu, also Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics at UT Southwestern. The recent failure of five phase III human clinical trials of small-molecule drugs to treat hepatocellular carcinoma   the most common form of liver cancer   prompted the authors to develop non-toxic carriers and explore  miRNA  therapies as a promising alternative. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short nucleic acids that can function as natural tumor suppressors, but require delivery strategies to transport these large, anionic drugs into cells. To date, no existing carrier has been able to provide effective delivery to late-stage liver cancer without amplified toxicity, which negates the desired effect. To address this problem, UTSW scientists chemically synthesized more than 1,500 different types of nanoparticles, which allowed discovery of lead compounds that could function in the heavily compromised cancerous liver. Synthetic, man-made nanoscale compounds called dendrimers provided an opportunity to screen different combinations of chemical groups, physical properties, and molecular size, Dr. Siegwart said. This approach led to the identification of dendrimers to deliver miRNA to late-stage liver tumors with low liver toxicity. The study, conducted in genetic mouse models with a highly aggressive form of liver cancer, demonstrated that the miRNA nanoparticles inhibited tumor growth and dramatically extended survival.","Published: January 27, 2016"

ABTL0812 preclinical development of ABLT0812 has been conducted by Drs. Tatiana Erazo and Jos  Miguel Lizcano, Cell Signalling and its Alteration in Disease Research Group, in collaboration with Ability Pharmaceuticals, owner of ABTL0812. This study was performed in collaboration with researchers from Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron and Hospital Cl nic in Barcelona, and from Universidad Complutense in Madrid. ABTL0812, a small molecule derived from a polyunsaturated fatty acid, is a first-in-class anti-tumour drug. Using cell and animal models (tumour xenografts), researchers identified a new mechanism of action: the activation of the PPAR receptors and the TRIB3 gene, leading to inhibition of the Akt/mTOR pathway.The intracellular Akt/mTOR pathway drives a wide variety of extracellular signals, controlling cell metabolism, size, growth and survival. This pathway is hyperactivated in most human cancers, favouring the proliferation and survival of the cancer cells and, therefore it is one of the principal targets of new anti-tumour drugs. By activating the PPAR receptors, ABTL0812 induces over-expression of TRIB3 protein, which binds to the Akt oncogene and inhibits the Akt/mTOR axis. ABTL0812 shows high efficacy in vitro and in vivo in preclinical trial studies, and an activity similar to or greater than standard chemotherapeutical drugs, but low toxicity. ""We have shown that ABTL0812 enhances the anti-tumour effect of several standard chemotherapeutic drugs, and it shows efficacy in those tumour cells that have become resistant to the standard treatment"", explains Dr Lizcano. Cell death by autophagy Through the newly identified pathway, ABTL0812 attacks tumour cells without affecting healthy cells, causing their death by autophagy without activating apoptosis (programmed cell death). It is the first anti-tumour drug to act in this way. Autophagy is a type of cell death that differs from apoptosis, usually associated with tasks of cell degradation and clearance. Autophagy has recently emerged as an alternative for tackling cancer cells without inducing the resistance to apoptosis generated by standard drugs. ABTL0812 is also the first drug to activate the gene TRIB3 through the PPAR receptors. The researchers highlight the role of TRIB3 in cell death and inhibition of tumour growth, as well as its use as a biomarker for monitoring the biological activity of the drug in humans. ""TRIB3 represents a new mechanism for inhibiting the Akt/mTOR pathway. In the next future we will study whether or not ABTL0812 generates resistance in tumour cells. If not, this would be very relevant to cancer therapy"", stresses Dr Lizcano. The new PPAR-TRIB3-Akt pathway might well be used to design safer and more effective anti-tumour drugs, such as ABTL0812. Clinical trials ABTL0812 has recently undergone Clinical Phase I trials in patients with advanced cancer, showing efficacy in several patients (long term stabilization) as well as low toxicity and high tolerability. Clinical Phase II trials are due to start soon in patients with endometrial cancer and lung squamous cell carcinoma. European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have designated ABTL0812 as an orphan drug for treatment of pediatric neuroblastoma. ""The publication of the new cellular mechanism in Clinical Cancer Research is a major step forward the development of ABTL0812 as a promising anti-tumour drug, and a success story of research collaboration between a company located in the UAB Research Park and the University"", says Dr. Carles Dom nech, CEO of Ability Pharmaceuticals S.L.

The first-ever global nitrogen footprint, encompassing 188 countries, has found the United States, China, India and Brazil are responsible for 46 percent of the world s nitrogen emissions. The international collaboration, led by the University of Sydney s Integrated Sustainability Analysis team, found developing countries tend to embody large amounts of nitrogen emissions from their exports of food, textiles and clothing. Australia is one of the few wealthy nations that is a net exporter of nitrogen, because of the substantial agriculture industry. The economic modelling, which grouped the nitrogen footprint into top-ranking bilateral trade relationships, noted a trend for increased nitrogen production and found developed nations largely responsible for emissions abroad for their own consumption. PhD candidate Ms Arunima Malik, who co-authored the paper with University of Sydney colleagues Professor Manfred Lenzen and Dr Arne Geschke, as well as two researchers from Yokohama National University and one from Kyushu University in Japan, said significant nitrogen net importers were almost exclusively developed economies.  High-income nations are responsible for more than 10 times the emissions of the poorest nations,  Ms Malik said.  This reflects greater consumption of animal products, highly processed foods and energy-intensive goods and services,  The vast bulk of emissions came from industries such as agriculture, transport and energy generation. Emissions from consumers-end use were mostly from sewage. A paper on the research is published today by the international journalNature Geoscience. Findings of the research of 2010 data includes:   Consumption in the United States, China, India and Brazil is responsible for 46 percent of global nitrogen emissions.   Japan and other developed nations import reactive nitrogen embodied in Chinese-made clothing as well as US and Australian meat.    The United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and France exchange significant amounts of nitrogen emissions embodied in food products.    Hong Kong s nitrogen imports are primary agricultural and raw food products because it lacks land to produce its own livestock and crops.   Developing countries such as China, India, Pakistan, and Thailand embody large amounts of nitrogen emissions into their exports of textiles and clothing.    High-income exceptions are Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina, which export significant nitrogen embodied in livestock products.   Per-capita nitrogen emission ranged from more than 100 kg annually for wealthy nations such as Hong Kong and Luxembourg, to less than 7 kg for developing nations such as Papua New Guinea, C te d Ivoire, and Liberia.

But in fact, that unlikely combination has just helped an international team make a key discovery about how the brain's ""garbage disposal"" process works and how little needs to go wrong in order for it to break down. See Also: Genetic defect underlying a rare disease identified The findings show just how important a cell-cleanup process autophagy is to our brains. It also demonstrates how even the tiniest genetic change can have profound effects on such an essential function. The new understanding could lead to better treatments for people whose brain and nerve cells have troubles ""taking out the trash."" Some such drugs already exist, but more could follow. In a new paper in the journal eLife, the team describes their painstaking effort to figure out what was wrong in the Turkish siblings, and to understand what it meant. The children have a rare condition called ataxia that makes it harder for them to walk. They also have intellectual disability and developmental delays. Ataxia is rare affecting about one in every 20,000 people and can cause movement problems in people who develop it in adulthood, or a range of symptoms when it arises in children. Because researchers from the University of Michigan (U-M) Medical School had published studies about families with multiple cases of ataxia before, Turkish researchers got in touch with them when the children's parents brought them in for treatment. That started a long chain of scientific sleuthing that led to this current publication. First, the U-M team studied samples of the children's DNA, and used advanced methods to pinpoint the exact genetic mutation that caused their symptoms. It turned out to be on one of the genes that scientists know play a key role in autophagy, called ATG5. Cells throughout the body trigger their internal garbage crews by turning on this gene and its partners, and using them to make proteins that help clean up the cell.

They hope that by cleaning that cellular junk up faster, they can keep it from causing symptoms. A tiny change in the ATG5 molecule that's a key part of the brain's ""garbage disposal"" mechanism is enough to cause major effects. The change involves just one amino acid. Credit: U-M  The children's ataxia gene problem turned out to be not such a big deal genetically it was such a slight mutation that it barely changed the way the cells made the protein. But that tiny change was enough to alter the autophagy process, and keep the children's brain and nerve cells from working properly. And that's where the yeast and Hungarian flies come in. Using them, the researchers could see what the children's problem gene did and what that meant for the autophagy process. That's because the autophagy process is so important that organisms ranging from yeast to humans make almost exactly the same ATG5 protein it's what is called ""highly conserved"" across species. What they saw amazed them. The genetic mutation led cells to change just one link in the chain of amino acids that make up the ATG5 protein. The new amino acid even had the same electrical charge as the usual one. But that one changed link happened to be at the exact spot where ATG5 and its partner, called ATG12, connect to one another. Since the two crucial autophagy partners couldn't link together as usual, the children's cells and the yeast and flies' cells couldn't clean up their cellular trash nearly as well. Autophagy didn't shut down completely, but less of it happened. And the fruit flies, like the children, had problems walking.

Using Denmark's Civil Registration System, Gidaya and the research team drew their sample from births in Denmark between Jan. 1, 1996 and Dec. 31 2006. All children in the study could be tied to a biological mother who'd been living in Denmark for at least a year. As a result, 5,200 children were a part of the case group (those diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder) and 52,000 children were in the control group (those who were not diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder). The study found that 3.7 percent of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder had mothers who took the  -2-andrenergic receptor (B2AR) agonist drugs during pregnancy. Of children not diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, 2.9 percent were born to mothers who took the drugs. Children with mothers who filled their B2AR agonist prescriptions from 90 days before the estimated conception date all the way until their birth date were considered to be exposed to the drug. If a prescription was not filled throughout that entire period, the children were not considered to be exposed. Learn More: High-normal thyroid hormone level in pregnancy may affect fetal brain development There was not a marked difference in the odds of a child eventually diagnosed with autism spectrum disease between each trimester (and the 90 days prior to conception). However, the study determined that there was a greater risk when B2AR agonists were taken throughout a pregnancy. Although the study uncovered the potential risks posed by pre-natal exposure to the drugs, immediately swearing off B2AR agonists could also be harmful. Uncontrolled asthma in pregnancy ""has been associated with poor birth outcomes,"" according to the study, so completely halting the use of B2AR drugs may not be the perfect solution. ""A challenge here is that the effects of the underlying health conditions, themselves, can also influence developmental outcomes,"" Newschaffer said. ""Newly pregnant women taking medication for asthma or other conditions need to work closely with their health care provider to weigh the benefits of continuing medication use against possible risks."" Additionally, the research team estimated that less than one percent of the autism spectrum disorder diagnoses in the entire population of the study (roughly 628,000 children) could be attributed to B2AR agonist drugs exposure. Just one other study has considered prenatal B2AR agonist exposure before, but not close to this scale. ""Further research is needed before these results are taken into clinical consideration in the course of prenatal care,"" Gidaya said.

Now researchers at the University of Zurich and the Medical University Vienna demonstrated Alzheimer-type pathology in brains of recipients of dura mater grafts who died later from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive dementia and brain plaques consisting of the A  protein. Conventional wisdom has it that AD is not a transmissible disease. However, plaques recovered from brains of AD patients were repeatedly found to induce further plaques when injected into the brains of laboratory mice, suggesting that transmission may actually occur. See Also: Nasal Test for Human Prion Disease Developed Reporting in the Swiss Medical Weekly, Karl Frontzek and colleagues have investigated individuals who received brain grafts of dura mater during neurosurgery. The dura mater is the leathery membrane covering the brain and spinal cord. Such grafts were necessary to allow the brain to heal after surgery. Tragically, some of the dura mater donors were infected with prions (the agents causing the fatal Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), and the grafting procedure transmitted the disease to the recipients. Frontzek and colleagues now report the presence of A  plaques in 5 of 7 brains of relatively young recipients of dura mater grafts who succumbed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. A  plaques were detected much more frequently than in brains of people who did not receive any dura mater grafts. A  plaques are highly unusual in young individuals and may have been caused by the dural grafts. This study adds to the evidence that the hallmarks of AD may indeed be transmissible under certain circumstances, and calls for heightened attention to an unexpected, potentially very serious problem of transplantation medicine.

Now, Inserm researchers have identified early cellular changes in the brain for the emergence of depressive symptoms, and a novel promising drug target. These results are published in the journal Nature Medicine. The aim of Manuel Mameli, Inserm researcher and Dr. Salvatore Lecca in his team, at Inserm Unit 839 the ""Institut du Fer a Moulin (IFM)"" (Inserm/UPMC), was to understand the initial cellular modifications occurring after a stressful aversive experience. Protracted stress and aversive experiences are indeed a trigger to engage depressive behaviors in animals and humans. See Also: The laternal habenula and its role in resisting alcohol's allure Using electrophysiological, viral-based and pharmacological approaches researchers found that the activity of neurons located in the lateral habenula a cerebral nucleus for aversion and disappointment increased after a stressful experience due to a reduced function of two proteins controlling neuronal function (GABAB and GIRK). Inserm scientists designed a rescue strategy that reversed the cellular modifications and ameliorated depressive symptoms after aversive experience by targeting a specific phosphatase (PP2A). By employing a rodent model of mood disorders (Learned Helplessness), that recapitulates a number of behavioral phenotypes typical of human depression, they have shown that the inhibition of PP2A was efficient to rapidly ameliorate the behavioral phenotype of mice.

The new findings, published this month in the journal eLife, give scientists a clearer picture of the process through which cells eliminate proteins that promote diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer s. See Also: Improving brain's garbage disposal may slow Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases  Having an atomic-resolution structure and a better understanding of this mechanism gives us the ability to someday design therapeutics to combat cancer and neurodegeneration,  said TSRI biologist Gabriel Lander, who was co-senior of author of the study with Andreas Martin of UC Berkeley. The new study sheds light on the proteasome, a molecular machine that serves as a recycling center in cells. Proteasomes break down spent or damaged proteins and can even eliminate harmful misfolded proteins observed in many diseases. The new research is the first study in almost 20 years to solve a large component of the proteasome at near-atomic resolution. Lander said the breakthrough was possible with recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (EM), an imaging technique in which a sample is bombarded with an electron beam, producing hundreds of thousands of protein images that can be consolidated into a high-resolution structure. Using cryo-EM, scientists investigated part of the proteasome that contains a deubiquitinase enzyme called Rpn11. Rpn11 performs a crucial function called deubiquitination, during which it cleaves molecular tags from proteins scheduled for recycling in the proteasome. This is a key step in proteasomal processing without Rpn11, the protein tags would clog the proteasome and the cell would die. From previous studies, scientists knew Rpn11 and its surrounding proteins latch onto the proteasome to form a sort of lid.  The lid complex wraps around the proteasome like a face-hugger in the movie  Alien,  said Lander. The lid complex can also exist separately from the proteasome which poses a potential problem. If Rpn11 cleaves tags from proteins that haven t gotten to the proteasome yet, those proteins could skip the recycling stage and cause disease. Scientists had wondered how nature had solved this problem. The study provides an answer, showing the lid complex as it floats freely in cells. In this conformation, Rpn11 is carefully nestled in the crook of surrounding proteins, stabilized and inactive.  There's a sophisticated network of interactions that pin the Rpn11 deubiquitinase against neighboring subunits to keep it inhibited in the isolated proteasome lid,  explained Corey M. Dambacher, a researcher at TSRI at the time of the study and now a senior scientist at Omniome, Inc., who was first author of the study with TSRI Research Associate Mark Herzik Jr. and Evan J. Worden of UC  Berkeley.   In order for Rpn11 to perform its job, it has to flip out of this inhibited conformation,  said Herzik. The new study also shows that, to flip out of the conformation at the proteasome, the proteins surrounding deubiquitinase pivot and rotate binding to the proteasome and releasing the deubiquitinase active site from its nook. Learn More: Live broadcast from inside the nerve cell Lander called the system  finely tuned,  but said there may be ways to manipulate it. The study collaborators at UC Berkeley made small mutations to the proteins holding Rpn11 in position, and found that any small change will release the deubiquitinase, even when the lid is floating freely. Lander said the new understanding of the mechanism that activates Rpn11 could guide future therapies that remove damaged or misfolded proteins.  Accumulation of these toxic proteins can lead to diseases such as Parkinson s and Alzheimer s, as well as a variety of cancers,  Lander said.  If we can harness the proteasome s ability to remove specific proteins from the cell, this gives us incredible power over cellular function and improves our ability to target certain cells for destruction.  Going forward, the researchers hope to use the same cryo-EM techniques to investigate other components of the proteasome and figure out exactly how it recognizes and destroys proteins.  There s still a lot to learn,  said Lander. The Scripps Research Institute  press release Dambacher CM et al.

A new special issue of the Journal of Laboratory Automation (JALA), titled  Advancing Scientific Innovation with Acoustic Droplet Ejection,  features more than 20 articles covering more than 200 pages of peer-reviewed scientific reports that highlight the revolutionary nature of ADE across a diverse range of scientific challenges.  ADE uses acoustic energy to transfer fluids without pipette tips or pin tools. Sound waves eject precisely sized droplets of source liquid to a microplate, microscope slide, or other surface. Demonstrated benefits of the approach include assay miniaturization, more biologically relevant results, and unparalleled precision, accuracy, and speed. The JALA special issue highlights how ADE has fostered innovation in many fields, including personalized medicine, synthetic biology, and drug combination therapy. Other articles focus on using ADE to improve results while reducing costs in next-generation sequencing library preparation, genotyping, RNA interference, and cell-based assays. The special issue also dives into areas not often addressed by JALA, including the novel benefits of ADE in protein crystallography and mass spectrometry. Joe Olechno, Ph.D., Senior Research Fellow at Labcyte and a guest editor of the journal, commented:  Scientists new to acoustic droplet ejection will be surprised that a liquid handling technique can have such significant impact on their experiments and results, and researchers currently using ADE will find new ways to use their systems with this special issue.  Mark Fischer-Colbrie, Chief Executive Officer of Labcyte, said:  The power of acoustic liquid handling is breaking barriers in an ever-growing number of applications. We are proud that Echo acoustic liquid handlers have helped set new standards of performance for automated liquid handling based on this approach. The results are that new drugs are being developed, others are being re-purposed, and true personalized medicine can be achieved.

Findings from the study answer some of these questions and could one day lead to new ways of diagnosing and treating cancer, said the study s senior author, Dr. John Abrams, Professor of Cell Biology at UT Southwestern. The investigators found that normal p53 gene action restrains transposons, mobile genetic elements called retroelements that can make copies of themselves and move to different positions on chromosomes. But, they discovered, when p53 is disabled by mutation, dramatic eruptions of these mobile elements occur. The study revealed that in mice with cancer and in human samples of two types of cancer (Wilms  tumors and colon tumors) disabled for p53, transposons became very active. In a healthy state, certain mechanisms work to keep these retroelements quiet and inactive, explained Dr. Abrams. One of those mechanisms is p53 action. Conversely, when p53 is mutated, retroelements can erupt.  If you take the gene away, transposons can wreak havoc throughout the genome by causing it to become highly dysregulated, which can lead to disease,  Dr. Abrams said.  Our findings help explain why cancer genomes are so much more fluid and destabilized than normal genomes. They also provide a novel framework for understanding how normal cells become tumors.  Although much more research is needed, Dr. Abrams said, the potential clinical implications of the team s findings are significant.  Understanding how p53 prevents tumors raises the prospect of therapeutic interventions to correct cases in which p53 is disabled,  Dr. Abrams said.  If retroelements are at the heart of certain p53-driven cancers, finding ways to suppress them could potentially allow us to prevent those cancers or intervene to keep them from progressing.  This understanding also could lead to advances in diagnosing some cancers through biomarkers related to p53 and transposon activity.  One possibility is that perhaps blood or urine tests could detect dysregulated retroelements that could be indicative of certain types of cancer,  Dr. Abrams said.","Published: January 26, 2016"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/antibiotic-susceptibility-testing-186650,Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing A team of biologists and biomedical researchers at UC San Diego has developed a new method to determine if bacteria are susceptible to antibiotics within a few hours  an advance that could slow the appearance of drug resistance and allow doctors to more rapidly identify the appropriate treatment for patients with life threatening bacterial infections  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In a paper published online this week the scientists reported the development of a rapid susceptibility test for Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium that causes some 60 percent of hospital-acquired infections and which has spread in communities, causing pneumonia and a variety of skin and tissue infections in both healthy and immune-compromised individuals. The development is important, say biomedical scientists, because of the critical need for physicians to rapidly discriminate between drug resistant strains (commonly termed MRSA for methicillin-resistant S. aureus) and drug sensitive strains, since these infections can progress rapidly, especially MRSA strains with additional resistance to newer antibiotics designed to treat pathogens that are now appearing in hospitals. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, antibiotic resistance causes two million illnesses and 23,000 deaths annually, costing the U.S. economy approximately $20-billion a year in direct health care costs and nearly eight million extra days in the hospital. Indeed, bacteria are evolving resistance to antibiotics much more quickly than global biomedical research efforts are delivering new drugs to market, leading to the appearance of infections caused by bacteria that are now resistant to every therapy. Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing allows doctors to discriminate between infections caused by drug sensitive bacteria, which can be treated with safe and effective antibiotics developed in what scientists call the golden age of drug discovery (the mid-20th century) such as penicillin, and those caused by drug resistant bacteria, which might require newer antibiotics, such as daptomycin or cubicin. This approach will decrease the emergence of resistance by reserving the newest drugs for those infections where they are most needed. The interdisciplinary team at UC San Diego was comprised of two infectious-disease specialists in the School of Medicine, Victor Nizet, MD, and George Sakoulas, MD; two biologists in the Division of Biological Sciences, Kit and Joe Pogliano; and Diana Quach, a bioengineering graduate student. The scientists applied a method previously developed in the Pogliano laboratories for drug discovery to antibiotic susceptibility testing.  Previously we developed a microscopy-based method that performs an autopsy on bacterial cells that allows us to determine how each cell died, and we have shown that this method can identify new antibiotics and help understand how these antibiotics work,  said Kit Pogliano, a professor of biology at UC San Diego who headed the research team.  We tested to see if this method could be applied to antibiotic susceptibility testing. Surprisingly, we not only found that our method was able to accurately differentiate sensitive S. aureus strains from resistant MRSA strains, but that we were able to identify two subgroups of MRSA strains, one of which is susceptible to combinations of antibiotics that could be used in the hospital. We are excited by the accuracy and speed of this test, as well as by its unanticipated ability to identify these two types of MRSA infections, which would have been missed by other tests.  Examining single cells has two key advantages over other testing methods, say the researchers. First, it is rapid, cutting days off the time for typical culture-based assays. It often takes days for a doctor to receive information on resistance, and this means that patients with life-threatening infections are often treated with the assumption that the infection is drug-resistant. Second, this method does not rely on having any detailed understanding of the bacterium causing the infection, or of the genes that convey resistance. This is particularly important in this case, since resistance to the drugs used to treat MRSA infections arise by several evolutionary pathways via different combinations of mutations, and it could also provide rapid treatment information for newly emerging bacterial pathogens, such as that which caused the infections transmitted by endoscopes.  Regardless of the type of bacterium, a healthy and growing bacterium looks different from a dead bacterium, so whenever we detect a difference in how the cells look, we know that the bacterium is sensitive to the antibiotic we have applied. When we combine careful culture conditions, cutting edge imaging methods and a detailed quantitative analysis, we can turn this simple approach into a reliable test,  said Joe Pogliano, a professor of biology.  Rapid and precise identification of antibiotic sensitivity patterns allows the most potent and effective drug to be administered,  said Nizet, a professor of pediatrics and pharmacy. ""Equally important, more specific antibiotic therapy can help preserve the normal bacteria living in our gut microbiome that play an important role in our health and immune system function.  The UC San Diego biologists say their new method has the potential to be applied to many different types of bacteria.  Our new method worked surprising well at rapidly detecting antibiotic resistant strains of S. aureus,  said Diana Quach, a graduate student and lead author on the study.  We are now optimizing it to provide a more accurate test for other types of antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ","Published: January 26, 2016"

Data summarizing screens of 40 compounds from the NCATS Oncology Library in 3D ovarian and pancreatic tumor microtissues will be presented by InSphero CSO and co-founder Dr. Jens M. Kelm during Monday afternoon s Assay Development & Screening poster session. InSphero and NCATS announced a collaboration in 2014 to develop improved phenotypic high-throughput screening (HTS) methodologies incorporating highly biologically relevant 3D tumor microtissue models that more closely mimic the in vivo tumor microenvironment than traditional 2-dimensional monolayer cell culture. 3D tumor microtissue co-cultures from ovarian or pancreatic tumor cell lines with stromal fibroblasts were generated using InSphero s patented hanging drop technology. Stromal fibroblasts were engineered to express a secreted reporter to simultaneously assess both anti-tumor efficacy and non-specific cytotoxicity.  Initial findings from the collaboration confirmed more than 50% of the 40 compounds tested displayed greater potency against ovarian and pancreatic tumor cells grown as 3D microtissues than to the same cells grown in monolayer.  Furthermore, the screen identified three compounds that showed anti-tumor efficacy in ovarian tumor microtissues only in the tumor/fibroblast co-culture model, highlighting the potential importance of mimicking heterogeneous tumor microenvironments when conducting such high-throughput in vitro screens.         Dr. Kelm notes that incorporating advanced multi-cell type 3D models derived from these and other types of cancer is critical to improving the translational value of in vitro screens.  Here we ve established a multi-parametric phenotypic screening method that not only factors in tumor size and cell viability, but also discriminates between anti-tumor and non-specific toxic effects of compounds. Using these results, we can determine a therapeutic index value by which compounds are ranked for their potential efficacy and specificity toward a particular cancer, using models that more accurately reflect in vivo tumor biology.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/no-more-insulin-injections-203680,No More Insulin Injections  Encapsulated pancreatic cells offer possible new diabetes treatment  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In patients suffering from Type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks the pancreas, eventually leaving patients without the ability to naturally control blood sugar. These patients must carefully monitor the amount of sugar in their blood, measuring it several times a day and then injecting themselves with insulin to keep their blood sugar levels within a healthy range. However, precise control of blood sugar is difficult to achieve, and patients face a range of long-term medical problems as a result. A better diabetes treatment, many researchers believe, would be to replace patients  destroyed pancreatic islet cells with healthy cells that could take over glucose monitoring and insulin release. This approach has been used in hundreds of patients, but it has one major drawback   the patients  immune systems attack the transplanted cells, requiring patients to take immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their lives. Now, a new advance from MIT, Boston Children s Hospital, and several other institutions may offer a way to fulfill the promise of islet cell transplantation. The researchers have designed a material that can be used to encapsulate human islet cells before transplanting them. In tests on mice, they showed that these encapsulated human cells could cure diabetes for up to six months, without provoking an immune response. Although more studies are needed, this approach  has the potential to provide diabetics with a new pancreas that is protected from the immune system, which would allow them to control their blood sugar without taking drugs. That s the dream,  says Daniel Anderson, the Samuel A. Goldblith Associate Professor in MIT s Department of Chemical Engineering, a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES), and a research fellow in the Department of Anesthesiology at Boston Children s Hospital. Anderson is the senior author of two studies describing this method in the Jan. 25 issues of Nature Medicine and Nature Biotechnology. Researchers from Harvard University, the University of Illinois at Chicago, the Joslin Diabetes Center, and the University of Massachusetts Medical School also contributed to the research. Encapsulating cells Since the 1980s, a standard treatment for diabetic patients has been injections of insulin produced by genetically engineered bacteria. While effective, this type of treatment requires great effort by the patient and can generate large swings in blood sugar levels. At the urging of JDRF director Julia Greenstein, Anderson and his colleagues set out several years ago to come up with a way to make encapsulated islet cell transplantation a viable therapeutic approach. They began by exploring chemical derivatives of alginate, a material originally isolated from brown algae. Alginate gels can be made to encapsulate cells without harming them, and also allow molecules such as sugar and proteins to move through, making it possible for cells inside to sense and respond to biological signals. However, previous research has shown that when alginate capsules are implanted in primates and humans, scar tissue eventually builds up around the capsules, making the devices ineffective. The MIT/Children s Hospital team decided to try to modify alginate to make it less likely to provoke this kind of immune response.  We decided to take an approach where you cast a very wide net and see what you can catch,  says Arturo Vegas, a former MIT and Boston Children s Hospital postdoc who is now an assistant professor at Boston University. Vegas is the first author of the Nature Biotechnology paper, co-first author of the Nature Medicine paper, and an author of the Nature Biotechnology paper.  We made all these derivatives of alginate by attaching different small molecules to the polymer chain, in hopes that these small molecule modifications would somehow give it the ability to prevent recognition by the immune system.  After creating a library of nearly 800 alginate derivatives, the researchers performed several rounds of tests in mice and nonhuman primates. One of the best of those, known as triazole-thiomorpholine dioxide (TMTD), they decided to study further in tests of diabetic mice. They chose a strain of mice with a strong immune system and implanted human islet cells encapsulated in TMTD into a region of the abdominal cavity known as the intraperitoneal space. The pancreatic islet cells used in this study were generated from human stem cells using a technique recently developed by Douglas Melton, a professor at Harvard University who is an author of the Nature Medicine paper. Following implantation, the cells immediately began producing insulin in response to blood sugar levels and were able to keep blood sugar under control for the length of the study, 174 days.  The really exciting part of this was being able to show, in an immune-competent mouse, that when encapsulated these cells do survive for a long period of time, at least six months,  says Omid Veiseh, a senior postdoc at the Koch Institute and Boston Children s hospital and co-first author of the Nature Medicine paper.  The cells can sense glucose and secrete insulin in a controlled manner, alleviating the mice s need for injected insulin.  The researchers also found that 1.5-millimeter diameter capsules made from their best materials (but not carrying islet cells) could be implanted into the intraperitoneal space of nonhuman primates for at least six months without scar tissue building up.  The combined results from these two papers suggests that these capsules have real potential to protect transplanted cells in human patients,  says Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT, a senior research associate at Boston s Children Hospital, and co-author on both papers.  We are so pleased to see this research in cell transplantation reach these important milestones.  Insulin independence The researchers now plan to further test their new materials in nonhuman primates, with the goal of eventually performing clinical trials in diabetic patients. If successful, this approach could provide long-term blood sugar control for such patients.  Our goal is to continue to work hard to translate these promising results into a therapy that can help people,  Anderson says.  Being insulin-independent is the goal,  Vegas says.  This would be a state-of-the-art way of doing that, better than any other technology could. Cells are able to detect glucose and release insulin far better than any piece of technology we ve been able to develop.  The researchers are also investigating why their new material works so well. They found that the best-performing materials were all modified with molecules containing a triazole group   a ring containing two carbon atoms and three nitrogen atoms. They suspect this class of molecules may interfere with the immune system s ability to recognize the material as foreign.","Published: January 26, 2016"

This success in large animals holds considerable potential for a safe, effective and long-lasting new treatment in humans with the same bleeding disorder. ""Our finding has great clinical relevance for patients with factor VII deficiency,"" said study leader Paris Margaritis, D. Phil., a hematology researcher at the Raymond G. Perelman Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics (CCMT) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). ""These dogs have the type of mutation found in the majority of patients with this disorder, so this approach could lead to a sustained gene therapy in people."" The Margaritis team collaborated with University of North Carolina (UNC) scientists, led by Tim Nichols, M.D., professor of Medicine and Pathology at the UNC School of Medicine. Factor VII deficiency is rare, found in about one in 300,000 to one in 500,000 people. Because a gene mutation impairs normal production of a blood clotting factor, patients may suffer excessive bleeding in the central nervous system or GI tract, or after surgery or an injury. Female patients may suffer excessive menstrual bleeding. Factor VII (FVII) deficiency has a range of severity, with about 40 percent of patients having severe disease. They are most commonly treated with regular infusions of clotting factor. Unlike hemophilia, a better-known bleeding disorder that predominantly affects males, factor VII deficiency strikes males and females equally. Gene therapy proposed for bleeding disorders involves introducing DNA carrying the code to produce the specific clotting factor lacking in patients. Researchers at CHOP and elsewhere have bioengineered an adeno-associated virus (AAV), which does not cause disease, as a vector to deliver DNA into cells where it can express enough factor to make the blood clot normally. Over the past 15 years, CHOP hematology researchers have performed clinical trials of gene therapy for hemophilia B that have helped define efficacy and dosing levels in humans. The CCMT at CHOP houses a clinical-grade laboratory that manufactures gene therapy vectors, including the AAV vectors used in the current study. Margaritis, a member of the CHOP group long engaged in hemophilia research, currently leads a laboratory focused on factor VII deficiency as well as hemophilia. ""We developed a unique animal model of this disease after identifying dogs with naturally occurring factor VII deficiency,"" said Margaritis. ""Our investigations enabled us to design the corrective gene to insert into our virus vector in the current study."" The CHOP team collaborated with scientists at UNC who have a long-established colony of dogs for hematology research. Based on previous work by Margaritis, the UNC team identified dogs for this gene therapy study. Nichols, the director of UNC's Francis Owens Blood Research Laboratory, characterized factor VII deficiency in four individual dogs. Using the AAV vectors supplied by Margaritis, Nichols injected the dogs with varying dosages and monitored their health outcomes and biological markers over several years. The treated dogs had expressed levels of clotting factor VII that would be therapeutic in humans, with long-term stability. In one dog, the effects persisted nearly three years. Based on kidney function, liver function, and blood measurements in the dogs, the treatment was safe, and did not elicit unwanted immune responses. The current study sets the stage for clinical trials in humans. This gene therapy may especially benefit young children with severe bleeding from factor VII deficiency, such as patients receiving care in CHOP's hematology program. ""This work is very exciting and promising,"" said Nichols, who added, ""The FVII-deficient dogs tolerated the initial gene therapy infusions very well and have had no adverse side effects over several years of follow up. In other related studies in dogs with hemophilia B, similar positive findings have translated to people with hemophilia B."" Both Nichols and Margaritis agreed: ""The table is now set to propose clinical trials that would treat people who suffer from FVII deficiency.""","Published: January 26, 2016"

We urgently need ways to detect ovarian cancer early, as the cancer is often diagnosed when it s too late for effective treatment because the cancer has already spread.  - Nell Barrie, Cancer Research UK This is because faults in the gene mean the cell cannot properly repair its DNA, causing genetic damage to build up, leading to cancer. The study, led by Cancer Research UK scientists from the University of Cambridge, UCL and Imperial College London, also showed that women who carried the BRIP1 gene mutation were more likely to be diagnosed with an aggressive cancer, at a later stage and tended to be diagnosed at an older age. The researchers compared the genes of more than 8,000 white European women   including around 3,250 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer, 3,400 women who did not have cancer and 2,000 women who had a family history of the disease. Professor Paul Pharoah, professor of cancer epidemiology at the Strangeways Research Laboratory, said:  Our work has found a valuable piece of the puzzle behind ovarian cancer and we hope that our work could eventually form the basis of a genetic test to identify women at greatest risk.  Finding these women will help us prevent more cancers and save lives. This would be important in a disease like ovarian cancer, which tends to be diagnosed at a late stage when the chances of survival are worse.  Each year in the UK around 7,100 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer and more than 4,200 women die from the disease. Nell Barrie, Cancer Research UK s senior science information manager, said:  Research like this, which looks at inherited genetic changes and how they can affect a woman s risk, is vital. We urgently need ways to detect ovarian cancer early, as the cancer is often diagnosed when it s too late for effective treatment because the cancer has already spread. We hope this research will lead to a reliable way to spot women at a high risk, so they can be monitored to find any signs of the disease at an early stage. ","Published: January 26, 2016"

At the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, engineers and biomedical scientists have assembled to form collaborative teams that are helping to drive this exciting area of research forward toward real-world applications. Now, a new study suggests mechanically-driven therapies that promote skeletal muscle regeneration through direct physical stimulation could one day replace or enhance drug and cell-based regenerative treatments. Discovered by a team at the Wyss Institute and the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the finding was published recently. ""Chemistry tends to dominate the way we think about medicine, but it has become clear that physical and mechanical factors play very critical roles in regulating biology,"" said Harvard bioengineer David Mooney, Ph.D., senior author on the new study, who is a Wyss Institute Core Faculty member and the Robert P. Pinkas Family Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). ""The results of our new study demonstrate how direct physical and mechanical intervention can impact biological processes and can potentially be exploited to improve clinical outcomes."" The multi-disciplinary team spanning the Wyss Institute s Programmable Nanomaterials and Bioinspired Robotics platforms was led by Mooney and also included soft roboticist Conor Walsh, Ph.D., who is a Wyss Core Faculty member, Associate Professor of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering at Harvard SEAS and Founder of the Harvard Biodesign Lab, and biomechanical engineer Georg Duda, Ph.D., who is a Wyss Associate Core Faculty member, Vice-Director of the Berlin-Brandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT) and the Director of the Julius Wolff Institute for Biomechanics and Musculoskeletal Regeneration at Charit -Universit tsmedizin Berlin. In humans, up to half of body mass is made up of skeletal muscle, which plays a key role in locomotion, posture, and breathing. Although skeletal muscles can overcome minor tears and bruising without intervention, major injuries commonly caused by motor vehicle accidents, other traumas, or nerve damage can lead to extensive scarring, fibrous tissue, and loss of muscle function. The team applied combined murine models of muscle injury and hind limb ischemia to investigate two potential mechanotherapies: an implanted magnetic biocompatible gel and an external, soft robotic pressurized cuff. To alleviate severe muscle injuries, the team implanted a magnetized gel called a ""biphasic ferrogel"" so that it would be in direct contact with the damaged tissue. Another experimental group of mice did not receive the ferrogel implant, but instead were fitted with a soft robotic, non-invasive pressurized cuff over the injured leg. Then, the ferrogel was subjected to magnetic pulses to apply cyclic stimulation to the muscle, while pulses of air allowed the cuff to cyclically massage the hind leg. Both groups received two weeks of localized mechanical perturbation using the two distinct methods. The researchers discovered that cyclic mechanical stimulation provided by either magnetized gel or robotic cuff both resulted in a two-and-a-half-fold improvement in muscle regeneration and reduced tissue scarring over the course of two weeks, ultimately leading to an improvement in muscle function and an exciting new finding that mechanical stimulation of muscle alone can foster regeneration. To their surprise, the ferrogel implant and pressurized cuff also resulted in very similar levels of regeneration, suggesting that the use of non-invasive pressurized cuffs or devices could one day help heal patients suffering from severe muscle injuries. ""Until now most approaches to muscle regeneration have been biologic, relying on the use of drugs or cells,"" said Christine Cezar, Ph.D., lead author on the study who completed her doctoral research at the Wyss Institute and Harvard SEAS. ""Our finding that mechanical stimulation alone is enough to enhance muscle repair could open the door to new non-biologic therapies, or even combinatorial therapies that employ both mechanical and biological interventions to treat severely damaged skeletal muscles."" The direct stimulation of muscle tissue increases the transport of oxygen, nutrients, fluids and waste removal from the site of the injury, which are all vital components of muscle health and repair. And according to Mooney, one of the most exciting aspects of this research is that its translation to the clinic in the form of a stimulatory device could be relatively rapid as compared to drug or cell therapies. Down the road, the principle of using mechanical stimulation to enhance regeneration or reduce formation of scarring or fibrosis could also be applied to a wide range of medical devices that interface mechanical components with body tissues. Currently, clinical devices are often plagued by the formation of thickened tissue capsules that form at the intersection of machine and man. The team plans to explore how the findings can make the jump from the laboratory to the clinic. ""This work clearly demonstrates that mechanical forces are as important biological regulators as chemicals and genes, and it shows the immense potential of developing mechanotherapies to treat injury and disease,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is a pioneer and leader in the field of mechanobiology. Ingber is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biologyat Harvard Medical School (HMS) and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, as well as Professor of Bioengineering at Harvard SEAS.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/photo-finish-205363,Photo Finish Nanoparticles pair photodynamic and molecular therapies against pancreatic cancer in mice  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A nanoparticle drug-delivery system tested in animal models that combines two complementary types of anticancer treatment could improve outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer and other highly treatment-resistant tumors while decreasing toxicity. Aa team of Harvard Medical School researchers based at the Wellman Center for Photomedicine at Massachusetts General Hospital described how they deployed a nanomedicine that combines photodynamic therapy the use of light to trigger a chemical reaction with a molecular therapy drug targeted against common treatment-resistant pathways. In an animal model, the dual approach reduced a thousand-fold the dosage of the molecular therapy drug required to suppress tumor progression and metastatic growth.  A broad challenge in cancer treatment is that tumor cells use a network of cellular signaling pathways to resist and evade treatment,  said co-lead author Bryan Spring, HMS research fellow in dermatology at Mass General when the work was done and now an assistant professor of physics at Northeastern University.  The new optically active nanoparticle we have developed is able both to achieve tumor photodamage and to suppress multiple escape pathways, opening new possibilities for synchronized multidrug combination therapies and tumor-focused drug release.  Two sides of photodynamic therapy Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses chemicals called photosensitizers that are activated by exposure to specific wavelengths of light to release reactive molecules that can damage nearby cells. In cancer treatment, PDT damages both tumor cells and their blood supply, directly killing some tumor cells and starving those that remain of nutrients. But as with many other types of treatments, treating tumors with PDT can stimulate molecular signaling pathways that support tumor survival. The nanomedicine developed by the Wellman-based team is made up of nanoliposomes spherical lipid membrane structures  enclosing a polymer nanoparticle that has been loaded with a targeted molecular therapy drug. The lipid membrane of these photoactivable multi-inhibitor nanoliposomes contains an FDA-approved photosensitizer that is a benzoporphyrin derivative. The nanoparticles are loaded with a molecular therapy drug called cabozantinib. Cabozantinib inhibits two important treatment escape pathways, VEGF and MET. While it has U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to treat thyroid cancer and is being tested against pancreatic cancer and several other tumors, it is quite toxic, requiring dose restrictions or treatment interruption. Because cabozantinib is delivered to every part of the body and not just to the tumor when administered orally, enclosing it in the nanoliposomes could reduce toxicity by confining its action to the area of the tumor. Led by Tayyaba Hasan, HMS professor of dermatology at Mass General, the investigators first confirmed in laboratory experiments that exposing the nanoliposomes to near-infrared light both activated the antitumor action of the benzoporphyrin derivative and, by disrupting the lipid membrane envelope, released the cabozantinib-containing nanoparticles. Escape pathways In two mouse models of pancreatic cancer, a single treatment consisting of intravenous delivery of the nanoliposomes followed by localized delivery of near-infrared light to the tumor site via optical fibers resulted in significantly greater reduction in tumor size than did either treatment with cabozantinib alone or PDT with the benzoporphyrin derivative alone. The nanoliposome treatment also was significantly more effective than treatment with both cabozantinib and benzoporphyrin derivative-PDT given as separate agents. Along with prolonged tumor reduction, nanoliposomes treatment also almost completely suppressed metastasis in the mouse models. While the VEGF treatment-escape pathway is known to be induced and sensitized by PDT, the research team found that PDT also induces signaling via the MET pathway. The ability to deliver cabozantinib and PDT almost simultaneously allowed the two therapeutics to be  at the right place at the right time  to cut off the rapid initiation of escape signaling that usually follows PDT.  This effect was reflected in how much more efficient nanoliposome-delivered treatment was in the animal models compared to either treatment alone, since PDT simultaneously sensitized the tumor to the second therapy. Delivery of cabozantinib directly to the tumor site produced these promising results at a dosage level less than one-thousandth of what is used in oral therapy, with little or no toxicity.  Tremendous potential  Right now we can say this approach has tremendous potential for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer for whom surgery is not possible,  said Hasan.  In our phase I/II clinical studies with PDT alone, tumor destruction was achieved in all cases, and we ve seen at least one case where PDT alone induced enough tumor shrinkage to enable follow-up surgery.  The more robust tumor reduction and suppression of escape pathways possible with the photoactivable multi-inhibitor nanoliposomes might enable curative surgery or improve the outcome of chemotherapy to enhance patient survival, Hasan said.  While we are encouraged by these results, this combination in a new nanoconstruct needs more validation before becoming a clinical treatment option,  Hasan said.","Published: January 26, 2016"

They do not usually cause a problem for healthy people as their immune systems kill the spores before they can grow and infect the body. But in patients with an immune system weakened by leukaemia or bone marrow transplantation, the fungus faces little resistance as it settles into the lungs and can lead to a frequently fatal disease known as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. This infectious disease is one of the most common causes of death in immunocompromised patients. Early, targeted treatment is needed to tackle the disease effectively but has been difficult until now because of the lack of fast and reliable methods for diagnosis. Professor Christopher Thornton, Associate Professor of Fungal Immunology and Director of the University of Exeter spin-out company ISCA Diagnostics, has worked with colleagues from the T bingen University and University Hospitals, Universit tsklinikum Essen, Paul Scherrer Institute and other European partners, to develop a promising new diagnostic process and tested it in a disease model. The researchers are working within the EU consortium MATHIAS, coordinated by Professor Bernd Pichler of T bingen s Werner Siemens Imaging Center. Their latest findings are published in the leading scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The new test involves attaching radioactively labeled antibodies to the infecting structures formed by the growing fungus, making it visible to doctors. The academics have used a combination of PET and MRI imaging, diagnostic technologies present in many hospitals, to identify the disease and to rule out lung infections caused by other pathogens such as bacteria or viruses. Until now, doctors seeking to diagnose invasive aspergillosis had to take samples of tissue or fluid from the lungs of patients with weakened immune systems who displayed abnormal symptoms. This work is an example of interdisciplinary cooperation from research teams across Europe enabling diagnostic markers for human use to be created. Professor Thornton said:  The process we have developed is currently being adapted for humans, which means that patients could be spared these unpleasant and sometimes dangerous procedures in the future and doctors will gain valuable time for successful treatment.  This test allows a more accurate and speedy diagnosis of an infection which can kill those who have a weakened immune system. This is the first use of this cutting-edge technology in fungal disease diagnosis and we hope it will keep more people alive. It is estimated that as many as 200,000 people globally die of this infection each year. This technology has the potential to bring about a radical shift in medical practice around the world and will act as a paradigm for detection of other potentially fatal diseases.  The MATHIAS consortium was established to develop novel state-of-the-art techniques with which to diagnose and treat invasive aspergillosis. The European Union is providing 6 million Euros in sponsorship for the consortium, which includes researchers from the UK, Germany, France, Denmark and Switzerland.","Published: January 26, 2016"

Diet and exercise may not be enough to restore normal weight or prevent overweight children from becoming obese, they conclude. It may be necessary to change their brain function. In a paper published this month in the journal Heliyon, the researchers suggest that mindfulness, a practice used as a therapeutic technique to focus awareness, should be studied as a way to encourage healthy eating and weight loss in children. See Also: Obesity is associated with brain s neurotransmitters ""Adults, and especially children, are primed towards eating more,"" said senior author Kevin Niswender, MD, PhD. ""This is great from an evolutionary perspective ... but in today's world, full of readily available, highly advertised, energy dense foods, it is putting children at risk of obesity."" ""We think mindfulness could recalibrate the imbalance in the brain connections associated with childhood obesity,"" added co-senior author Ronald Cowan, MD, PhD. ""Mindfulness has produced mixed results in adults ... So far there have been few studies showing its effectiveness for weight loss in children."" Childhood obesity in the United States has nearly doubled during the past 30 years, and among adolescents it has tripled. In 2010, a third of US children were considered obese or overweight. The Vanderbilt study included 38 children, five who were considered obese and six who were overweight. Their eating behaviors were assessed using a questionnaire, and their brain function was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Three brain regions in adults are potent modulators of eating habits: the nucleus accumbens, associated with reward-motivated behaviors; the frontal pole, associated with impulsivity; and the inferior parietal lobe (IPL), associated with response inhibition, the ability to inhibit or override a response such as overeating. Learn More: Obesity and diabetes symptoms in mice improved by reversing brain inflammation The researchers used MRI to determine the balance of functional neural connectivity between these eating-related brain regions in children of various weights. ""We wanted to look at the way (their) brains function in more detail so we can better understand what is happening neurologically in children who are overweight and obese,"" said first author and Vanderbilt graduate student BettyAnn Chodkowski. They found that as weight increased among children, the connectivity between the inhibition-associated IPL and reward-associated nucleus accumbens decreased, while connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and the impulsivity-associated frontal pole increased. This suggests that unhealthy eating behaviors and obesity could reflect an imbalance in the functional connectivity of brain areas associated with response inhibition, impulsivity and reward. The practice of mindfulness can increase response inhibition and decrease impulsivity. Mindfulness has been used to encourage healthy responses to everyday adversities, although few studies have tested its use in the area of healthy eating or weight loss among children. Among adults, mindfulness has had mixed results when used for weight loss and weight control, which may reflect ""the extreme tenaciousness of adult obesity,"" as well as age-related loss of brain plasticity, the researchers noted. This supports the importance of early identification of children at risk for obesity, and the need to develop novel methods to treat and prevent it, they concluded.

See Also: Epigenetic tie to neuropsychiatric disorders found ""People in our field have been waiting for this for decades,"" explain researchers Kees van Oers and Veronika Laine from NIOO-KNAW. The reference genome of their favorite model species, the great tit, is ""a powerful toolbox that all ecologists and evolutionary biologists should know about."" Coming from a single Dutch bird, the genetic code of the assembled reference genome will help to reveal the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution. This is essential for understanding how wild species adapt to our changing planet. In addition to looking at the genome, the research team have also determined the so-called transcriptome and methylome. The latter belongs to the field of epigenetics: the study of what you can inherit not in but 'on' your genes. When specific DNA sequences in the genome are methylated, this modifies how the genes function. The research team sequenced the complete genomes of a further 29 great tit individuals from different parts of Europe. This enabled them to identify regions in the great tit's genome that have been under selection during recent evolution of the bird. These regions appeared to be overrepresented for genes related to learning and cognition. ""The great tit has evolved to be smart,"" says Van Oers. ""Very smart."" It's not your average bird, as it belongs to the top 3% smartest birds when it comes to learning new behavior. That makes it a perfect candidate for research into the evolution of learning, memory and cognitive processes. Learn More: Learning impacts how the brain processes what we see What that research has revealed are so-called conserved patterns of methylation in those same regions, present not only in birds but also in humans and other mammals. It's evidence of a correlation between epigenetic processes such as methylation and the rate of molecular evolution: ""the more methylation, the more evolution."" And so the great tit has once more proved that its role as a model species in a variety of biological research fields for over 60 years is by no means coincidental.

The team, led by Professor Peter Cockerill, demonstrated that a single cycle of activation of the T cells within the immune system leaves behind imprints in the chromosomes within these immune cells. This imprinting occurs at the genes that need to be switched back on as soon as immune cells are reactivated. They propose that this forms the basis of a long-term memory which allows for an immediate response when the body encounters an infection and T cells are activated for a second time. Rather than immune cells remaining  switched on  permanently to fight infection continuously, they return to a dormant state but are altered by the initial infection and remain in a partially active state primed to combat any recurrence. Professor Cockerill explained,  The initial immune response switches on certain regions within chromosomes of previously inactive T cells to leave them in a more open structure so that they can then sit poised, ready to respond much faster when activated again in the future.  Being able to silence the immune system until it is required to fight infection is also vitally important, else there would be a risk of damaging cells that are part of the host. The team identified a mechanism that allows cells to remain poised without producing the molecules associated with inflammation that are used to fight infection. If this tight control breaks down then it can be the cause of a number of inflammatory or autoimmune disorders, when healthy cells are targeted as if they were foreign.","Published: January 25, 2016"

Researchers exposed 30 healthy adults to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, one of the world s leading causes of bacteria-induced diarrhea and a common cause of so-called  traveler s diarrhea,  which often requires treatment with antibiotics. To learn more about why some people get sick and others stay well, the researchers drew patients  blood and looked for clues in their gene expression -- the degree to which some genes are turned on or off. They noted differences among the six patients with severe symptoms, and six participants who showed no symptoms despite having been exposed to the bacteria. Among the thousands of genes that distinguished the two groups, there were significant differences in the activity of 29 immune-related genes that could predict who would go on to become sick and those who would remain well, said senior author Ephraim Tsalik, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of medicine at Duke. Tsalik and colleagues at Duke collaborated with the Durham VA Medical Center and Johns Hopkins University on the study.  Within each group, there were changes in the patients  gene expression patterns happening throughout the experiment,  Tsalik said.  We found there were differences with the subjects that seemed to predict who would become sick. We interpreted those as signals that show an innate resistance to infection. There may be certain genetic traits that can increase or decrease your chances of being infected after exposure to a pathogen.  The scientists hope to replicate the study with other types of infections, including viral and respiratory illnesses such as the flu.  We have found a set of immune-related genes to focus on,  Tsalik said.  Now if we can understand how the expression of these genes imparts this resistance and susceptibility, we might be able to offer new ways to boost your immune system to protect against prevalent infections such as E. coli or better predict who is at greatest risk of getting an infection.  A household with children is the perfect example, said Tsalik, who has three children ages 11, 9 and 5, who often come home bearing the newest cold or stomach bug to make the circuit at school or sports practice.  You have a natural experiment in that environment,  Tsalik said.  Our whole household gets exposed. I tend not to get sick and if I do, it s pretty mild and might last a day. Meanwhile, my wife gets one cold after another. We re discovering that among the factors that play a role in your resistance to infection -- including the environment, stress levels, and gut bacteria -- there is likely to be an innate biological explanation, too.

The reason why we survive their daily attacks is the ability of the immune system to neutralize these invaders in numerous ways. Plasma cells are key players in this process. They fight infections and establish long-lasting protection against pathogens. Plasma cells are white blood cells that develop from B-cells. They are the effector cells of the humoral immune response. Their main function is to produce antibodies that patrol the body in large numbers to neutralize harmful invaders. A functional plasma cell produces up to 10,000 antibodies per second to release them into the blood stream. This outstanding achievement can be visualized with a powerful microscope, as active plasma cells are packed with antibody-producing vesicles, constituting the so-called endoplasmic reticulum that is essential for antibody assembly and secretion.   B-cells need to be activated by antigens (foreign substances) in order to develop into plasma cells. They first form plasmablasts that migrate to the bone marrow where they survive for many years or even decades. The long-lasting protection provided by active vaccines is based on this immunological memory of plasma cells. A Central Role for Blimp1 Scientist have known about the functions of plasma cells for quite a while. However, details of how the differentiation and function of these cells are regulated were still unknown. Now an important key to understanding the function of plasma cells has been discovered by a team headed by Meinrad Busslinger, Senior Scientist and Deputy Director at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) in Vienna, Austria. In a five-year project, the team succeeded in deciphering the role of the protein Blimp1 as a central regulator of plasma cell development and function. In its current issue, the science journal Nature Immunology publishes the results of the team in Vienna as well as the work of Australian colleagues that complements the Viennese results. In detailed studies, scientists at the IMP identified all genes that are involved in the development of plasma cells in mice. First author Martina Minnich, whose PhD-thesis provided the groundwork for the publication, explains the results: ""We found that more than 50 percent of these genes are regulated by Blimp1. Therefore, this factor must be of vital importance for plasma cells. Furthermore, we were able to show for the first time that Blimp1 not only switches genes off but can also switch other genes on. This is an important discovery for the understanding of plasma cell development."" ""Most of the essential functions of plasma cells are controlled by the factor Blimp1"", Meinrad Busslinger summarizes the results. ""It regulates their mobility and migration to the bone marrow. Blimp1 is also responsible for the enormous increase in size of the endoplasmic reticulum and the strong up-regulation of antibody production in plasma cells. Humoral immunity would not be possible without Blimp1."" No Antibodies without Blimp1 Even though Blimp1 is necessary for the development of plasma cells, mature plasma cells can survive without this factor. However, when Blimp1 is switched off, they become non-functional as they no longer produce antibodies. This unexpected finding is the result of work carried out at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI) in Melbourne, Australia. The study, which is published back-to-back with the Austrian paper, was led by Stephen Nutt, Head of the Division of Molecular Immunology at WEHI. The picture that emerges from the Australian study perfectly complements the results obtained at the IMP.  Insight into the manifold functions of Blimp1 is not only important for our understanding of the immune system but may also be relevant for human medicine. Mutations in the Blimp1 gene can block the further differentiation of B-cells, which contributes to the formation of malign B cell tumors known as lymphomas. Moreover, quiescent plasma cells can sometimes switch to uncontrolled cell growth and thus turn into plasma cell tumors or multiple myelomas. Another aspect of the immune system that is highly relevant for medicine is the broad spectrum of autoimmune diseases. Conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are an example for the serious damage to organs and tissue caused by misguided immune responses which generate plasma cells producing auto-reactive antibodies that turn against the body s own tissue. Meinrad Busslinger: ""The published results have yielded profound insight into the function of plasma cells. They also raise new interesting questions which we will address in forthcoming projects.""","Published: January 25, 2016"

The parasite is transmitted by biting midges found in many areas of sub-Saharan Africa however the exact species of the vector is unknown. A team of researchers from the University of Copenhagen, the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute and Uganda Ministry of Health, used data from a survey of 76 schools across Uganda to model areas of high risk of M. perstans infection and examine its overlap with other common parasitic infections.  Between 2000 and 2003 a national survey gathered blood-samples from 12,207 pupils aged 5-19 years old across 76 schools in Uganda. The survey tested for the presence of three common parasitic infections: M. perstans, Wuchereria bancrofti (the causative agent of lymphatic filariasis) and Plasmodium (the parasite responsible for Malaria). M. perstans infections were observed in 62% of the schools, with prevalence ranging from 0.4% to 73%. Co-infection with W. bancrofti was found in 0.3% of pupils and co-infection with Plasmodium in 3%. Only 9 pupils were recorded as infected with all three species. The researchers examined a range of bioclimatic factors to see which were associated with increased levels of M. perstans infection. Of the different types of vegetation (forest cover, open vegetation and cropland) only forest had a significant positive association with infection. A significant positive association was also found with a high density of cattle, although not with other livestock such as sheep, goat, pig or chicken. A significant negative association was found with land surface temperature. These results suggest that infection is associated with cooler or forested areas with reduced temperature variation, and areas with high densities of farmed cattle. Older students were found to be at a significantly higher risk of infection and positive associations were found with W. bancrofti infection in areas where the parasites overlapped. Bayesian multivariate regression analysis was used to build up predictive risk map for M. perstans across Uganda. High risk of infection was predicted for the central area, with pockets of increased risk in the north-west and south-east. Low risk was predicted in the north-eastern and central south regions. ""Although this predictive risk map is a model, and the data is based on schoolchildren only, it does provide a deeper understanding of the zoogeographical patterns of this highly neglected disease and may be useful for targeting areas for surveillance and measuring elimination progress"", says lead author and assistant professor Anna-Sofie Stensgaard, from the Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate, University of Copenhagen.

Changes in ocean heat storage are important because the ocean absorbs more than 90 percent of the Earth s excess heat increase associated with global warming. The observed ocean and atmosphere warming is a result of continuing greenhouse gas emissions. Quantifying how much heat is accumulating in the Earth system is critical to improving the understanding of climate change already under way and to better assess how much more to expect in decades and centuries to come. It is vital to improving projections of how much and how fast the Earth will warm and seas rise in the future. Increases in upper ocean temperatures since the 1970s are well documented and associated with greenhouse gas emissions. By including measurements from a 19th century oceanographic expedition and recent changes in the deeper ocean, the study indicates that half of the accumulated heat during the industrial era has occurred in recent decades, with about a third residing in the deeper oceans. The team analyzed a diverse set of ocean temperature observations and a large suite of climate models. Scientists have measured ocean temperatures in a variety of ways over time, from lowering pairs of minimum-maximum thermometers to different depths on lines dangled overboard during the H.M.S. Challenger 1872-1876 expedition, to the highly accurate modern instruments used on a global array of robotic profiling floats (called Argo(link is external)), launched around 1999 that  phone home  the data using satellites. This study found that estimates of ocean warming over a range of times and depths are consistent with results from the latest generation of climate models, building confidence that the climate models are providing useful information.  The year-round, global distribution of ocean temperature data collected by Argo has been key in improving our estimates of ocean warming and assessing climate models,  noted LLNL oceanographer Paul Durack. While Argo only samples the upper half of the ocean volume, pilot arrays of new  Deep Argo  floats that sample to the ocean floor are being deployed. This vast ocean volume in the deeper half is only measured infrequently by research vessels. Those deep data also show warming, even in the bottom layers of the ocean in recent decades.  Given the importance of the ocean warming signal for understanding our changing climate, it is high time to measure the global ocean systematically from the surface to the ocean floor,  said NOAA oceanographer Gregory Johnson.","Published: January 25, 2016"

Jacquin Niles, an associate professor of biological engineering at MIT, sees potential for such a transformation in what others might consider an unlikely subject: the malaria parasite. Niles  lab works mainly on eliminating malaria as a disease, but he is taking a radically different approach to the parasite with his project to re-engineer the organism as a vehicle for drug delivery. The project is funded by an Amar G. Bose Grant, which supports high-risk, high-reward research.  It s the kind of proposal I like,  Niles says.  It lets you be creative, imaginative, and free in your thinking without the constraint of whether a reviewer would consider this too risky or impossible.  Biochemistry and tropical diseases Niles was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands and grew up in the British territory of Anguilla. In high school, he was fascinated by biology, chemistry, and the interface between the two   biochemistry.  I liked thinking about living systems, but I also liked understanding how they work and how chemistry drives an understanding of biology,  Niles says. One of his biology courses covered tropical diseases like helminthic worm infections, dengue, and malaria.  It struck me as an area of immense importance, because there are a lot of people who are affected by these diseases, living in the developing world without access to treatment or an invested research structure focused on these diseases,  Niles says. He was also fascinated by the disease processes.  They all have these very intricate life-cycles; each organism has its unique way of reproducing and doing so across different hosts and vectors,  he says. As an undergraduate in chemistry at MIT, Niles began doing research through an Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) project on the enzyme nitrogenase. His interest in chemistry, biology, and medicine led him to pursue an MD/PhD at Harvard University; for his PhD, he conducted research at MIT with Steven Tannenbaum, professor of biological engineering, in oxidative DNA damage related to cancer. After completing postdoctoral work at the University of California at Berkeley with Professor Michael Marletta, Niles returned to MIT to apply his skills to one of the diseases that had always fascinated him.  It all came full circle, coming back to the initial thing that grabbed my interest in high school: How do we integrate knowledge from different disciplines to think about new ways of studying these otherwise intractable systems?  Niles says. A feature, not a bug Niles  lab focuses on understanding the basic biology of the malaria parasite, to prevent and treat the illness it causes.  That s been the major thrust of the lab since we started   how can we defeat malaria the disease?  Niles says.  There are too many people who are affected by and die as a result of it, and it s important that we eliminate malaria as a disease globally.  As Niles delved deeper into the biology of the parasite, he began to ponder another side of the organism. Around half a million people die each year from malaria   but some 200 million that are infected survive. Many experience no symptoms. These people are clinically immune, meaning they carry the parasite, but show no overt disease symptoms. This makes it hard to identify carriers of the disease, as the malaria parasite survives in the bloodstream at some level, but the carrier is unaware.  That s a problem for eliminating the disease, but if you flip that around to think about the organism as a potential therapeutic vehicle, it becomes an interesting  feature  rather than a  bug ,  Niles says. What Niles realized is that such an organism   one that survives in the human bloodstream over the long term with no adverse health effects   could be an ideal vehicle for producing and delivering medicine directly into a person s bloodstream. Engineering existing organisms to deliver drugs is not a new idea. Researchers are already genetically modifying microbes in the gut to produce molecules the body needs. But some drugs need to be delivered through the bloodstream and can t get there from the gut   they get broken down in the digestive environment, or they aren t efficiently absorbed into the bloodstream. Niles  proposal is, to his knowledge, the first aiming to re-engineer the malaria parasite into a medical tool and provide a novel way to deliver therapeutic drugs: The organism that now infects could one day cure.  We can, through engineering, convert this organism s parasitic lifestyle into a more symbiotic relationship,  Niles says. Coding and controlling With the support of the Bose Grant, Niles aims to develop his idea over the next three years. The first step is to systematically determine which molecules the malaria organism can be engineered to create. To do this, Niles and his colleagues will be inserting into the organism s DNA gene sequences that are known to code for specific molecules. After determining the range of molecules that the organism can create, the researchers will need to hone their controls over the creation and delivery of the drugs.  What will be harder is thinking about ways in which we can control how and when these molecules are made,  Niles says.  Can we have the organism sense when a therapeutic is needed by the host and respond appropriately to ensure that the right amount of it is made and delivered at the right time?  If those controls can be calibrated, the results could one day make treatments more effective and patients  lives easier.  The long-term goal would be to have these engineered organisms serve as bioreactors that can self-sustain and self-regulate within the bloodstream in conjunction with natural immune pressure,  Niles says.  Then you can imagine that rather than having to go every month for an injection of replacement enzyme, for example, that you could go for significantly longer periods without needing another medical intervention.  Incorporating a malaria-derived organism into a medical treatment comes with an interesting set of challenges as well. Researchers will need to ensure that the treatment comes with zero risk of causing malaria and zero potential to transmit disease, via the natural mosquito vector, for example.  An important part of this will be to cripple the parasite with respect to its ability to be naturally transmitted,  Niles says. He has reason to believe this is possible:  We know which genes we need to irreversibly delete so that these organisms could never be transferred by mosquitoes to another person.  Niles foresees bumps in the road   as he says,  this organism never ceases to surprise me,    but he s excited to pursue an out-of-the-box idea that has the potential to improve human health.  It s the kind of idea you have and then think about on and off, but it s hard to sit down and write a proposal because it seems too  out there,  Niles says.  In many ways, I felt like the Bose proposal was an outlet for the accumulation of invested thinking about this project. When the call came around, I thought,  Maybe this is the moment.

Malaria is a massive global health burden, with a current WHO estimate of around 600,000 deaths annually, although this figure could rise sharply if treatment failures associated with drug-combination therapies become widespread. Dr Henry Staines, a senior research fellow at St George s, University of London said iron is essential to a malaria parasite s survival but can also be toxic at high levels. He explained that iron is also critical to the effectiveness of important antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine and the artemisinins.  This research will not only allow us to identify new ways to attack the parasite but will help us to understand how our current arsenal of antimalarial drugs work,  he said.  This is important because antimalarial drugs such as artemisinin-based combination therapies are not as effective as they were in South East Asia, which is a worrying trend.  The researchers used a mutant baker s yeast, in which the sequence for a specific iron transport protein is removed from the yeast s DNA.  With the yeast mutant unable to make this iron transport protein, it loses the ability to grow when iron is present. We thought a protein from the malaria parasite might perform the same iron transporting role, as the one lacking in the mutant yeast,  Dr Staines said. Dr Ksenija Slavic from Instituto de Medicina Molecular in Lisbon said to confirm our hypothesis, we introduced the DNA sequence for the malaria parasite protein into the mutant yeast and showed that the yeast regained their ability to grow in the presence of iron.  A mutant malaria parasite was also created by removing the iron transporter s gene, which resulted in reduced numbers of parasites in the liver, where they first multiply, and subsequently in the blood, at which point patients become ill , Dr. Slavic said. Inside liver cells, iron binding chemicals that remove iron improved how well the mutant parasites grew, adds Dr. Maria Mota from Instituto de Medicina Molecular in Lisbon, one of the senior authors of the study.  Inside red blood cells, we found that these mutant parasites contained an increased amount of iron that could be potentially toxic, explaining the reduced numbers. Both findings imply that the gene helps the parasite to tolerate iron. This greater understanding of iron regulation in the malaria parasite could lead to urgently needed new treatment strategies,"" Dr Mota said Next up, the researchers will be looking into how the mutant parasites are impacted by anti-malarial drugs that use iron.","Published: January 25, 2016"

As such, several  / -tubulin inhibitory agents are used as therapeutic drugs against cancer cells, which are undergoing vigorous cell division. However, microtubules perform important work even outside of cell division, and normal cells not undergoing division can be harmed as well, so the side effects of such treatments have become problematic. A wide variety of research has shown that  -tubulin activates during cell division and that it is overexpressed in a portion of cancer cells, so it holds potential as a target protein for new anticancer agents with few side effects.

The research uses DNA strand displacement, a technology that has been widely used outside of cells for the design of molecular circuits, motors and sensors. Researchers modified the process to provide both  AND  and  OR  logic gates able to operate inside the living cells and interact with native messenger RNA (mRNA). The tools they developed could provide a foundation for bio-computers able to sense, analyze and modulate molecular information at the cellular level. Supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).  The whole idea is to be able to take the logic that is used in computers and port that logic into cells themselves,  said Philip Santangelo, an associate professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University.  These devices could sense an aberrant RNA, for instance, and then shut down cellular translation or induce cell death.  Strand displacement reactions are the biological equivalent of the switches or gates that form the foundation for silicon-based computing. They can be programmed to turn on or off in response to an external stimuli such as a molecule. An  AND  gate, for example, would switch when both conditions were met, while an  OR  gate would switch when either condition was met. In the switches the researchers used, a fluorophore reporter molecule and its complementary quenching molecule were placed side-by-side to create an  off  mode. Binding of RNA in one of the strands then displaced a portion of nucleic acid, separating the molecules and allowing generation of a signal that created an  on  mode. Two  on  modes on adjacent nucleic acid strands created an  AND  gate.  Demonstrating individual logic gates is only a first step,  said Georg Seelig, assistant professor of computer science and engineering and electrical engineering at the University of Washington.  In the longer term, we want to expand this technology to create circuits with many inputs, such as those we have constructed in cell-free settings.  The researchers used ligands designed to bind to specific portions of the nucleic acid strands, which can be created as desired and produced by commercial suppliers.  We sensed molecules and showed that we could respond to them,  said Santangelo.  We showed that we could utilize native molecules in the cell as part of the circuit, though we haven t been able to control a cell yet.  Getting basic computing operations to function inside cells was no easy task, and the research required a number of years to accomplish. Among the challenges were getting the devices into the cells without triggering the switches, providing operation rapid enough to be useful, and not killing the human cell lines that researchers used in the lab.  We had to chemically change the probes to get them to work inside the cell and to make them stable enough inside the cells,  said Santangelo.  We found that these strand displacement reactions can be slow within the cytosol, so to get them to work faster, we built scaffolding onto the messenger RNA that allowed us to amplify the effects.  The nucleic acid computers ultimately operated as desired, and the next step is to use their switching to trigger the production of signaling chemicals that would prompt the desired reaction from the cells. Cellular activity is normally controlled by the production of proteins, so the nucleic acid switches will have to be given the ability to produce enough signaling molecules to induce a change.  We need to generate enough of whatever final signal is needed to get the cell to react,  Santangelo explained.  There are amplification methods used in strand displacement technology, but none of them have been used so far in living cells.  Even without that final step, the researchers feel they ve built a foundation that can be used to attain the goal.  We were able to design some of the basic logical constructs that could be used as building blocks for future work,  Santangelo said.  We know the concentrations of chemicals and the design requirements for individual components, so we can now start putting together a more complicated set of circuits and components.  Cells, of course, already know how to sense toxic molecules and the development malignant tendencies, and to then take action. But those safeguards can be turned off by viruses or cancer cells that know how to circumvent natural cellular processes.  Our mechanism would just give cells a hand at doing this,  Santangelo said.  The idea is to add to the existing machinery to give the cells enhanced capabilities.  Applying an engineering approach to the biological world sets this example apart from other efforts to control cellular machinery.  What makes DNA strand displacement circuits unique is that all components are fully rationally designed at the level of the DNA sequence,  said Seelig.  This really makes this technology ideal for an engineering approach. In contrast, many other approaches to controlling the cellular machinery rely on components that are borrowed from biology and are not fully understood.  Beyond those already mentioned, the research team included Benjamin Groves, Yuan-Jyue Chen and Sergii Pochekailov from the University of Washington and Chiara Zurla and Jonathan Kirschman from Georgia Tech and Emory University.","Published: January 25, 2016"

AbbVie has both identified new molecules and developed novel technology to hit key targets, with the objective of designing new immunotherapy for the benefit of our patients,  said Padmanee Sharma, M.D., Ph.D., immunotherapy platform scientific director and professor of Genitourinary Medical Oncology and Immunology at MD Anderson. Existing immunotherapy drugs thwart tumors and significantly extend survival in groups of patients with advanced melanoma and lung cancer, and they also are being tested in other cancer types.  Jim Allison, Ph.D., executive director of the immunotherapy platform and chair of Immunology at MD Anderson notes there are more potential targets for drugs to mobilize the immune system to attack other cancers.  Cancer immunotherapy drugs that remove two types of brakes on immune response are really just the tip of the iceberg for this field,  Allison said.  Our agreements with companies such as AbbVie allow academic and industry scientists to work efficiently to move the science forward and extend this approach to more patients.  The immunotherapy platform is part of MD Anderson s Moon Shots Program. AbbVie s research efforts in immunotherapy leverage the company s strengths in biology, protein engineering and chemistry.  Pairing MD Anderson s cutting-edge preclinical, translational and clinical capabilities with AbbVie s innovative discovery and development programs accelerates our ability to deliver new therapies that can help transform the lives of people affected by cancer,  said Michael Severino, M.D., executive vice president, R&D and chief scientific officer, AbbVie.  AbbVie is pleased to partner with MD Anderson s world class experts so that together we can advance the science of cancer immunotherapy for the benefit of patients around the world.  AbbVie and MD Anderson will each assign two scientists to a joint scientific committee, which decides on projects to pursue.  With the collaboration agreement in place, we can move quickly to design and implement new studies, clinical trials, and exchanges of reagents and take other actions without having to reach new, separate agreements,  Sharma said. The collaboration will get underway with projects driven by AbbVie Biotherapeutics, AbbVie s center of innovation in the biotech hub of the San Francisco Bay Area. Future projects will draw from the extensive portfolio of oncology programs across the AbbVie Oncology pipeline. The AbbVie agreement is the first of a limited number to come in a new wave of collaborations with MD Anderson s immunotherapy platform, said Ferran Prat, Ph.D., J.D., vice president of Strategic Ventures.  MD Anderson s immunotherapy platform combines expertise and advanced technology for preclinical modeling, innovative clinical trials and immune monitoring before, during and after treatment to better understand drug mechanisms and identify biomarkers to guide treatment. The platform works collaboratively with a select group of pharmaceutical companies and with MD Anderson s moon shots, a transdisciplinary initiative to accelerate development of new treatments and prevention programs deriving from scientific discoveries. Platform leader Allison invented the breakthrough immunotherapy approach called immune checkpoint blockade, which uses antibodies to block proteins on the surface of T cells that otherwise shut down T cells  attack on cancer.

The majority of patients with stage II colon cancer cancer that has grown into or through the outer layer of the colon but has not spread to lymph nodes or distant organs are cured by surgery alone. However, about 15 to 20 percent of these patients eventually relapse and die of metastatic disease.  The problem is that we don t have an easy way to single out these patients before they relapse and accurately predict who could benefit from postsurgical, or adjuvant, chemotherapy,  saidPiero Dalerba, MD, assistant professor of medicine, pathology and cell biology at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) and the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC), and first author of the paper. Previous studies have found biomarkers in tumor cells that identify which stage II colon cancer patients are at higher risk for relapse after surgery. However, many of those biomarkers do not also predict which of these patients would actually benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. The current study took a different approach to the search for potential biomarkers. Instead of looking at gene-expression patterns obtained from the random sampling of tumor cells, the researchers focused on the gene-expression pattern of cancer stem cells the source of mature, or differentiated, tumor cells a field of study pioneered by the paper s senior author Michael F. Clarke, MD, of Stanford University.  We reasoned that tumors containing high numbers of cancer stem cells might be associated with a more aggressive disease, and wanted to find a way to easily find them,  said Dr. Dalerba. To identify these tumors, the authors took advantage of a novel bioinformatics approach designed by Debashis Sahoo, PhD, of the University of California-San Diego, and co-first author of the study.  In essence, we asked a computer the following question: can you help us find a gene whose lack of expression is always associated with high levels of cancer stem cell markers?  said Dr. Sahoo. By analyzing data from more than 2,000 colon cancer patients, the authors identified 16 biomarkers that fulfilled this criterion. Of these, only one a gene called CDX2 was found to be clinically actionable, meaning that a standardized diagnostic test for detecting expression of the gene was already available. CDX2 is known to regulate cell differentiation in the layer of cells that line the colon, where the cancer begins. In the study, patients whose tumors lacked CDX2 expression had a poorer prognosis compared to those whose tumors scored positive for CDX2 expression.  We wanted to understand if the small group lacking CDX2 expression approximately 4 percent of the global colon cancer population fared poorly because of an intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy,  said Dr. Dalerba.  To our surprise, we found that, on the contrary, tumors lackingCDX2 expression, despite being very aggressive from a biological point of view, also appeared to benefit from early treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy.  Further analysis using data from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project revealed that this observation also held true for stage II colon cancer patients, again showing that patients with tumors lacking CDX2 expression were more likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy than patients whose tumors did express the gene.  What s exciting is that an inexpensive, simple test for CDX2 expression is already widely available,  said Dr. Dalerba. Additional clinical studies, such as prospective and randomized clinical trials, are needed before using the test as a clinical decision-making tool for colon cancer patients, he added.","Published: January 25, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/machine-learning-uncovers-unknown-bacterial-features-200031,Machine Learning Uncovers Unknown Bacterial Features Technique robustly identified characteristic gene expression patterns in response to antibiotics  low oxygen conditions  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A powerful new machine-learning technique can be applied to large datasets in the biological sciences to uncover previously unknown features of organisms and their genes, according to a team led by researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. For example, the technique learned the characteristic gene-expression patterns that appear when the bacterium is exposed to low-oxygen conditions and robustly identified changes that occur in response to antibiotics. The technique employs a recently developed algorithm called a  denoising autoencoder,  which learns to identify recurrent features or patterns in large datasets without being told what specific features to look for. In 2012, for instance, when Google-sponsored researchers applied a similar method to randomly selected YouTube images, their system successfully learned to recognize major recurrent features of those images including cats. In the new study Casey Greene, PhD, an assistant professor of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics, in collaboration with Deborah Hogan, PhD at Dartmouth College, used a system of denoising autoencoders to analyze many large datasets that measure how genes in the bacteria are expressed in different conditions. Greene is also a senior fellow at the Penn Institute for Biomedical Informatics.  The system learned fundamental principles of bacterial genomics just from these data,  Greene said.  We expect that this approach will be particularly useful to microbiologists researching bacterial species that lack a decades-long history of study in the lab. Microbiologists can use these models to identify where the data agree with their own knowledge and where the data seem to be pointing in a different direction.  Greene thinks that these are cases where the data may suggest new biological mechanisms. Last year, Greene and his team published the first demonstration of the new method in a biological context: an analysis of two gene-expression datasets of breast cancers. The new study was considerably more ambitious -- it covered all 950 gene-expression arrays publicly available at the time for the bacteriumPseudomonas aeruginosa, from 109 distinct datasets. This bacterium is a notorious pathogen in the hospital and in individuals with cystic fibrosis and other chronic lung conditions and is often difficult to treat due to its high resistance to standard antibiotic therapies. First author Jie Tan, a graduate student at Dartmouth, where Greene, until recently, had his laboratory, developed ADAGE (Analysis using Denoising Autoencoders of Gene Expression) and applied it to the P. aeruginosa datasets. The data included only the identities of the roughly 5,000 P. aeruginosa genes, their measured expression levels in each published experiment. The goal was to show that this  unsupervised  learning system could uncover important patterns in P. aeruginosa gene expression and clarify how those patterns change when the bacterium s environment changes, for example when in the presence of an antibiotic. Even though the model built with ADAGE was relatively simple roughly equivalent to a brain with only a few dozen neurons it had no trouble learning which sets of P. aeruginosa genes tend to work together or in opposition. To the researchers  surprise, the ADAGE system also detected differences between the main laboratory strain of P. aeruginosa and strains isolated from infected patients.  That turned out to be one of the strongest features of the data,  Greene said.  We were struck by the similarities between P. aeruginosa grown in association with cultured lung epithelial cells and these bacteriataken directly from the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis,  said John H. Hammond, a graduate student in the Hogan Lab who collaborated on this project.  We are excited to continue to use ADAGE in combination with data from patient samples and experiments using laboratory models to discover better ways to find therapies to treat cystic fibrosis lung infections.   We think that the proliferation of  big data  provides an opportunity, through the use of unsupervised machine-learning, to find completely new things in biology that we didn t even know to look for,  Greene said.","Published: January 25, 2016"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/mitochondrial-troublemakers-unmasked-in-lupus-201200,Mitochondrial Troublemakers Unmasked in Lupus Drivers of autoimmune disease inflammation discovered in the traps of pathogen capturing white blood cells  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. New findings expose how mitochondria might instigate lupus-like inflammation.  Mitochondria are the power stations in living cells, but they also have many other sidelines.  The byproducts of their respiration and energy conversion, for instance, include molecules eager to participate in chemical changes. These reactive oxygen species are two-edged swords that can harm the body or protect it.   For reasons yet unknown, certain white blood cells in lupus and in other chronic inflammatory diseases produce elevated amounts of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Researchers at the University of Washington and the National Institutes of Health are discovering more about how these chemicals and other mitochondrial materials provoke the body s self-attack in systemic lupus erythematosus.  Because mitochondria are a potent source of reactive oxygen species, and because mitochondrial DNA has been implicated recently in inflammatory responses,"" the researchers noted,  we wanted to examine their role in this autoimmune disorder. Lupus is more common in young women and varies in its constellation of symptoms from patient to patient. Its severity ranges from mild to disabling. In some patients, lupus is life-threatening.  Currently no treatment exists to cure it.  Periodic flares can affect one or more parts of the body.  During a flare, a burning rash, which early doctors thought resembled the scratch of a wolf s paw, often reddens the cheeks.  The joints, kidneys, and the sack surrounding the heart can become swollen and painful. If the brain is under autoimmune siege, headaches, seizures or episodes of psychosis can occur. Neutrophils   the white blood cells that normally capture pathogens   are among the suspects in autoimmune disorders.  Germs, as well as damaged cells and immune particles the body manufactures, can goad a neutrophil to create a mesh outside itself in an attempt to ensnare offenders. Past studies suggest that these traps also could promote the organ damage of lupus. The formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, or NETs, can lead to a type of cell death called NETosis. Either aberrant NETosis or impaired NET clearance likely plays a role in several autoimmune disorders, including lupus. In mouse studies, drugs that inhibit NETosis result in improvements in lupus. These drugs also reduce hardening of the arteries and abnormal clotting. How these traps are generated, however, and how they provoke inflammation when no infection is present, are both unclear. These questions, and the contribution of these phenomena to lupus-like disease, are being explored by a research team jointly led by Keith B.  Elkon, UW professor of medicine and head of the Division of  Rheumatology, and Mariana J. Kaplan, chief of the Systemic Autoimmunity Branch of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Elkon is the Mannik-Henderson Professor of Medicine at UW Medicine. They report that the RNA-protein immune complexes commonly found in lupus patients induce cell death by NETosis in a process dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Usually the cell has mechanisms that prevent oxidative DNA damage.  In the case of immune complex stimulated NETosis, the cell s survival mode is disrupted. The nuclear membrane disintegrates, leaving genomic DNA exposed to reactive oxygen species.  Mitochondrial DNA is more vulnerable than genomic DNA to oxidant damage, the researchers explained. After the immune complexes spur the neutrophils, the cells  mitochondria rise to the cell surface.  They spew oxidized mitochondrial DNA into their environment through the neutrophil extracellular trap.  In lab studies, the researchers noted, this extracellular release of oxygenated mitochondrial DNA promotes an inflammatory reaction.  When this DNA is injected into mice, its unwelcome presence is detected by DNA sensors and leads to activation of a protein called STING. A chemical warning goes off.  The resulting type 1 interferon signaling calls up antimicrobial defenses and other immune responses.   In a related study on a mouse model of lupus, the researchers treated the mice with scavengers that clean up the overflow of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. They found this could reduce type I interferon responses, as well as the severity of the lupus. This finding is clinically relevant to autoimmune diseases, according to the research report, because various reactive oxygen species inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical settings for other diseases. They could be studied as potential therapeutic agents for systemic autoimmunity. In the clinical part of the research project, a distinct class of neutrophils   low-density granulocytes   were obtained in blood samples from individuals with systematic lupus erythematosus and people with chronic granulomatous disease.  The researchers noted that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species played a necessary role in the spontaneous NETosis cell death of low-density granulocytes. Furthermore, the released NETs contained large amounts of oxidized mitochondrial DNA. The authors noted,  Together these findings highlight a role for mitochondria in the generation of neutrophil extracellular traps, and also in the generation of pro-inflammatory oxidized mitochondrial DNA in autoimmune diseases.  The results, in summary, offer evidence that neutrophil extracellular traps enriched with mitochondrial DNA could help drive lupus-like diseases and could lead to novel therapeutic approaches.","Published: January 25, 2016"

Even when people with HIV infection take antiretroviral drugs, more than 50 percent have HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), which can result in any of a variety of symptoms, including confusion and problems with memory. NIH-supported scientists led by Harris A. Gelbard, M.D., Ph.D., at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry developed the compound URMC-099 to protect against HIV-associated neurologic damage. This and similar compounds would always be administered with an antiretroviral medication; the objective of this research was to test URMC-099 as such an adjunct. The antiretroviral medication used is in a class of anti-retroviral drugs (protease inhibitors) commonly used to treat HIV, but in this case, NIH-supported researchers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, led by Howard E. Gendelman, M.D., used nanotechnology to reconstitute the compound in an effort to enhance its ability to reach and remain in target tissues. (Nanotechnology involves use or creation of materials in very small dimensions billionths of a meter.) The process renders the drug into crystal form and adds a protective coat. The small scale formulation of nano-antiretroviral therapy (nanoART) enables it to penetrate and endure in immune cells, forming reservoirs of antiretroviral activity. Previous work had shown that URMC-099 was anti-inflammatory and protected neuronal tissue. Used alone it is not antiviral, but it was possible, the researchers reasoned, that its anti-inflammatory effects could enhance the beneficial effects of an antiviral. They tested the combination therapy in HIV-infected mice that have what is essentially a human immune system; human immune stem cells are introduced in mice that are born lacking components of a normal immune system. On a number of measures, URMC-099 enhanced the effects of nanoART beyond expectations. It reduced HIV levels beyond what nanoART could achieve alone and below what is detectable. It increased the ability of nanoART to form persistent antiretroviral  depots  in immune cells which are thought to be central to these drugs  ability to inhibit HIV replication.  Our ultimate hope is that we re able to create a therapy that could be given less frequently than the daily therapy that is required today,  said Gelbard.  If a drug could be given once every six months or longer, that would greatly increase compliance, reduce side effects, and help people manage the disease, because they won t have to think about taking medication every day.   The NIH Office of AIDS Research has identified the development of long acting HIV therapies and research towards a cure as high priority topics for research support,  said Dianne M. Rausch, Ph.D., director of NIMH s Division of AIDS Research.  The nanoformulation strategies reported here could facilitate targeting HIV anatomic reservoirs such as lymph nodes and brain which are currently difficult to reach because of limited penetration of anti-retroviral drugs into tissue compartments.

In a study involving the fruit fly equivalent of an oncogene implicated in many human leukemias, Northwestern University researchers have gained insight into how developing cells normally switch to a restricted, or specialized, state and how that process might go wrong in cancer.  The fruit fly s eye is an intricate pattern of many different specialized cells, such as light-sensing neurons and cone cells. Because flies share with humans many of the same cancer-causing genes, scientists use the precisely made compound eye of Drosophila melanogaster (the common fruit fly) as a workhorse to study what goes wrong in human cancer.A multidisciplinary team co-led by biologist Richard W. Carthew and engineer Lu s A.N. Amaral studied normal cell behavior in the developing eye. The researchers were surprised to discover that the levels of an important protein called Yan start fluctuating wildly when the cell is switching from a more primitive, stem-like state to a more specialized state. If the levels don t or can t fluctuate, the cell doesn t switch and move forward.  This mad fluctuation, or noise, happens at the time of cell transition,  said Carthew, professor of molecular biosciences in Northwestern s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.  For the first time, we see there is a brief time period as the developing cell goes from point A to point B. The noise is a state of  in between  and is important for cells to switch to a more specialized state. This limbo might be where normal cells take a cancerous path.  The researchers also found that a molecular signal received by a cell receptor called EGFR is important for turning the noise off. If that signal is not received, the cell remains in an uncontrolled state. By pinpointing this noise and its  off  switch as important points in the normal process of cell differentiation, the Northwestern researchers provide targets for scientists studying how cells can go out of control and transform into cancer cells. The  noisy  protein the Northwestern researchers studied is called Yan in the fly and Tel-1 in humans. (The protein is a transcription factor.) The Tel-1 protein instructs cells to turn into white blood cells; the gene that produces the protein, oncogene Tel-1, is frequently mutated in leukemia.  The EGFR protein that turns off the noise in flies is called Her-2 in humans. Her-2 is an oncogene that plays an important role in human breast cancer.   On the surface, flies and humans are very different, but we share a remarkable amount of infrastructure,  said Carthew, a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University.  We can use fruit fly genetics to understand how humans work and how things go wrong in cancer and other diseases.  Fruit fly cells are small and closely packed together, making study of them challenging. Carthew and Amaral s team of biologists, chemical and biological engineers, computer scientists and chemists together figured out how to identify and analyze thousands and thousands of individual cells in the flies  eyes.  In the past, people have built models of regulatory networks that control cell differentiation mostly by genetically perturbing one or two components of the network at a time and then compiling those results into models,  said Amaral, professor of chemical and biological engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering.  We instead measured the retina as it developed and found the unexpected behavior of the key regulatory factors Yan and EGFR.  Nicol s Pel ez, first author of the study and a Ph.D. candidate in interdisciplinary biological sciences working with Amaral and Carthew, built new tools to study this strange feature of noise in developing flies. His methods enabled the researchers to easily measure both the concentration of the Yan protein and its fluctuation (noise). It takes 15 to 20 hours for a fruit fly cell to go from being an unrestricted cell to a restricted cell, Carthew said. Pel ez determined the Yan protein is noisy, or fluctuating, for six to eight of those hours.  Studying the dynamics of molecules regulating fly-eye patterning can inform us about human disease,  Pel ez said.  Using model organisms such as fruit flies will help us understand quantitatively the basic biological principles governing differentiation in complex animals. ","Published: January 25, 2016"

The independent expert committee made 11 recommendations in total, which included improvements to existing screening programmes for Down s syndrome and other related conditions, cervical cancer, bowel cancer and eye screening for people with diabetes. Important conclusions from the meeting include: Introducing faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) The committee recommended that the faecal immunochemical Test (FIT) should replace the current first test used in the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme. Replacing the current Faecal Occult Blood (FOB) test with FIT provides the opportunity to detect and prevent more cancers and is easier to use. Introducing non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) The committee recommended that non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) be introduced as an additional test into the NHS Fetal Anomaly Screening Programme (FASP) as part of an evaluation. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation will mean that the test is rolled out across England in such a way that the screening programme can be altered if necessary in light of any real life findings. FASP offers screening to women in pregnancy to find out how likely it is that their baby has Down s syndrome, Edwards  syndrome, or Patau s syndrome. The new test is more accurate, meaning that fewer women will need unnecessary diagnostic tests, which can potentially mean a small risk of losing their baby. Introducing HPV primary screening Currently the NHS Cervical Screening Programme uses cytology testing to look for abnormal cells that could be the first sign of cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is used as a secondary measure in women needing further investigation. Evidence suggests that screening for HPV first will be a more effective way to let women know whether they are at risk of developing cervical cancer. Changing the frequency of diabetic eye screening appointments The committee recommended that people with diabetes, at low risk of sight loss, only need to attend eye screening tests every 2 years rather than annually, after evidence showed it was safe to do so. The screening interval for people with a high risk of sight loss should remain yearly as now. Dr Anne Mackie, Director of Programmes for the UK NSC, said: The latest recommendations which propose changes to existing screening programmes would bring about considerable improvements. We hope that once implemented, these changes would help identify more people who would benefit from early treatment and in some cases, save lives every year. All recommendations made by the committee are based on internationally recognised criteria and a rigorous evidence review and consultation process. At the same meeting, after careful consideration of the evidence, the UK NSC did not recommend introducing screening programmes for the following conditions:   congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in newborns   glaucoma   hearing loss in older adults   mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I)   neuroblastoma in children   oral cancer   prostate cancer The UK NSC will review all these recommendations again in 3 years as part of its regular evidence review process or earlier if significant new evidence becomes available.","Published: January 25, 2016"

This is now possible with the recent development of an ACT (anti-cross talk) plate adaptor incubated within ARUP Laboratories. In a collection plate, each specimen is centimeters from neighboring wells; following preparation, an evaporation process begins to really stir things up, increasing the likelihood of cross-contamination. The slightest contamination a fraction of a percent crossover can alter important clues, result in false-positive test results, and potentially play havoc with a patient's diagnosis and treatment. For example, if a patient who's been prescribed morphine for pain management has a sample with a concentration of 20,000 nanograms/milliliter located right next to a specimen belonging to a recovering heroin addict in a rehabilitation program, drugs detected in the recovering addict's test results could cause expulsion from the rehab program, despite the person remaining clean. When Frederick Strathmann, PhD, joined ARUP's ranks of medical directors four years ago, experienced laboratory staff alerted him to some red flags regarding test results in the Toxicology Laboratory, despite the lab utilizing mass spectrometry, a state-of-the-art detection technology. ""This could happen in any situation where you have the process of an organic phase being dried down,"" explains Strathmann, who is a medical director of the Toxicology Laboratory, associate scientific director of High-Complexity Platforms Mass Spectrometry, and associate director of ARUP's Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology .  ""Mass spectrometry is not infallible,"" says Strathmann. Through testing and experimentation, the laboratory started honing in on the culprit cross-contamination and how it occurred; the next step was figuring out how to prevent it. Honing in on the Culprit and the Solution Strathmann developed a computer program, named Hotspot, that could identify potential cross-talk contamination using a proprietary algorithm based on past assay performance data and characterization of the ""hotspot"" phenomenon. A ""hotspot"" in laboratory medicine is the location of a high concentration of analytes compared to concentrations in surrounding wells. ""Without the diligence of the laboratory and eventually the use of this program, 3 percent of our results could have been false; this is a huge false-positive rate for mass spectrometry,"" explains Strathmann. ""It should be at 0 percent."" The Hotspot program highlighted what was happening and allowed automated monitoring to mitigate cross over, reducing staff analysis time from up to two hours to 15 seconds for a single 96-well plate. However, it was not the ultimate solution; false-positive results were eliminated from patient results, but the laboratory still dealt with a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity for the new Hotspot metric. ""We had a pretty good idea of what was occurring. You've got solvent that is drying and is coming out of the wells on these 96-well plates, and it could potentially be finding its way into neighboring wells,"" says Strathmann. ""We figured that if we could change the dynamics of how solvent is coming out, we could stop vapors from exiting and entering from each well."" Working with ARUP's Bioanalytical Engineering Group, Strathmann and colleagues designed a plate adapter, in which each well tapers into a pyramid shape, constricting the area where solvent can exit. This pressures the vapor to expel faster and move up and away from the plate. ""Narrowing the channel increased the force of solvent coming out and narrowed the opening in which the vapor could invade a neighboring well,"" explains Strathmann. As in-house expertise for repairing and maintaining lab instrumentation, ARUP's Bioanalytical Engineering Group can draw from this continuum of experience to help troubleshoot or develop solutions. ""We are the company's memory when it comes to analytical problems,"" quips Matt Beatie, supervisor of the group. ""Beatie's team has phenomenal insight into theoretical mass spectrometry. Without them, we would not have accomplished what we did,"" adds Strathmann. The final step to market involved working with the University of Utah's Technology & Venture Commercialization Office, which licensed the ACT plate adaptor to Biotage, a worldwide supplier of laboratory instruments and consumables.","Published: January 25, 2016"

Vitamins help keep both organisms healthy and energetic by enabling proteins to do their work. For bacteria, a dearth of vitamins can spell death. Now scientists at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have made a ""vitamin mimic"" - a molecule that looks and acts just like the natural vitamin to bacteria, but can be tracked and measured by scientists in live cells. The research offers a new window into the inner workings of living microbes that are crucial to the world's energy future, wielding great influence in the planet's carbon and nutrient cycle and serving as actors in the creation of new fuels. Vitamins are a powerful currency for researchers seeking to compel microbes to give up their secrets. ""We have a lot to learn about how microbes accumulate and use nutrients that are necessary for their survival and growth. This provides a window for doing so,"" said chemist Aaron Wright, the corresponding author of the study. ""Perhaps we will be able to make a microbial community do what we want, by controlling its access to a specific nutrient,"" Wright added. To control the bacteria via vitamins, Wright and his team have to know what other proteins in the cell the vitamins are consorting with, and where and when. Think of a planner analyzing emergency services for a large city. Knowing that an ambulance enters the city occasionally and transports some people somewhere, for instance, is not nearly as useful as knowing the precise address of the caller, the identity of the injured, and the location of the nearest hospital. It's the same for scientists trying to understand microbial cells. While a cell is infinitesimally small, the activity within resembles the hustle and bustle of a large city, with many functions within carried out by thousands of entities. Knowing precisely which vitamins aid which proteins, under what circumstances, to keep things running is a must if scientists are to maximize microorganisms for energy production and other processes. ""Microbial communities are organized based on their ability to get the resources they need to survive and grow,"" said Wright. ""We need to understand how the availability of nutrients, like vitamins, helps determine the structure of a microbial community as a step toward controlling that community in ways we would like to be able to do."" An anchor for pond scum Wright's team studied the bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus J-10-fl, which is a common member of microbial mats - gloopy natural structures (think pond scum) where layers containing different groups of microbes band together. In these collections, C. aurantiacusoften plays the role of anchor, helping to hold together an assortment of microbes. The bacteria, which resemble strands of string under the microscope, are usually found in hot springs, since they enjoy temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Wright's team performed a series of synthetic chemical steps to alter three vitamins that C. aurantiacus needs to survive: vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), and vitamin B7 (biotin). While the bacteria recognized the substances as normal vitamins, the researchers can monitor the mimics much more easily than their natural counterparts. Wright's team used the mimics to relay a treasure trove of information about how vitamins enter the cell and interact within the cell, by analyzing the precise location of the molecules' activity in living cells. Through a system called affinity-based protein profiling, Wright's group effectively tagged these molecules where they're active, then used techniques such as mass spectrometry to sort and measure proteins of interest. One of the team's findings suggests multiple vitamins may share the same molecular machinery to gain entry into the cell. The team is still investigating these data. These findings can provide a road map for scientists like Wright who are trying to direct microbes as part of broad efforts to create clean, renewable fuels and reduce the effects of climate change.","Published: January 25, 2016"

Until now, consolation behavior has only been documented in a few nonhuman species with high levels of sociality and cognition, such as elephants, dolphins and dogs. Prairie voles are particularly social rodents, causing them to be the focus of many studies. This led James Burkett and colleagues to explore their potential for empathy-motivated behaviors. See Also: Oxytocin shows different effects in male and female mice The researchers created an experiment where relatives and known individuals were temporarily isolated from each other, while one was exposed to mild shocks. Upon reunion, the non-stressed prairie voles proceeded to lick the stressed voles sooner and for longer durations, compared to a control scenario where individuals were separated but neither was exposed to a stressor. Measurements of hormone levels revealed that the family members and friends were distressed when they could not comfort their loved one. The fact that consoling behavior occurred only between those who were familiar with each other including non-kin members but not strangers, demonstrates that the behavior is not simply a reaction to aversive cues, the authors note. Since the oxytocin receptor is associated with empathy in humans, the researchers blocked this neurotransmitter in prairie voles in a series of similar consolation experiments. Blocking oxytocin did not cause family members and friends to alter their self-grooming behavior, yet they did cease consoling each other. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of empathy and the evolution of complex empathy-motivated behaviors. American Association for the Advancement of ScienceBurkett JP et al.

Lead author Jonathan Muraskas, MD, and colleagues examined the medical records of 32 full-term infants who developed severe cerebral palsy and mental retardation. The records indicate that this brain damage occurred after the babies were born, and despite proper resuscitation. See Also: High-normal thyroid hormone level in pregnancy may affect fetal brain development The study is published in the Journal of Perinatology. ""All too often in cases of professional liability, the focus is on the last two hours of a normal 7,000-hour term pregnancy,"" Dr. Muraskas and colleagues wrote. ""This study would support closer scrutiny of the first two hours [following birth] as a possible [cause] for non-preventable adverse neurological outcomes in newborns."" Dr. Muraskas is co-medical director of Loyola's neonatal intensive care unit and a professor in the Department of Pediatrics of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. Out of every 1,000 full-term newborns, between one and three infants experience encephalopathy (disease in the brain), marked by impaired level of consciousness, seizures, difficulty breathing and depressed reflexes. While studies have found that only 8 percent to 14.5 percent of such cases are due to inadequate blood supply to the brain during delivery, the syndrome remains a leading cause of allegations of mismanagement by obstetricians. Learn more: Do spinal cord injuries cause subsequent brain damage? The cases Dr. Muraskas examined included 18 newborns with an infection called chorioamnionitis and 14 newborns with severe anemia. Chorioamnionitis occurs when bacteria infect the membranes that surround the fetus and the amniotic fluid in which the fetus floats. Anemia is due to an insufficient amount of blood in the baby after birth. Both conditions are difficult to detect prior to birth. Medical records examined in the study showed that the gases in the umbilical cord blood of these newborns were normal, and there was little injury to the brains' deep gray matter. These and other indicators strongly suggest that the babies had not suffered brain damage before birth. But once the babies were born, they were unable to cope on their own with the devastating effects of their infections or anemia. For example, babies infected by chorioamnionitis developed sepsis, an overwhelming immune response to infection that can cause tissue damage and organ failure. Severe cases of chorioamnionitis and anemia can impede delivery of oxygen to the brain and other vital organs. In such cases, even the best resuscitation efforts are unable to prevent severe brain damage, Dr. Muraskas said. Despite appropriate obstetrical and pediatric-neonatal management, the presence of chorioamnionitis or fetal anemia can result in ""devastating outcomes,"" Dr. Muraskas and colleagues wrote.

The p53 gene long has been known to suppress tumor formation, but the mechanisms behind this function   and why disabling the gene allows tumors to form   were not fully understood. Findings from the study, published recently in Genes & Development, answer some of these questions and could one day lead to new ways of diagnosing and treating cancer, said the study s senior author, Dr. John Abrams, Professor of Cell Biology at UT Southwestern. The investigators found that normal p53 gene action restrains transposons, mobile genetic elements called retroelements that can make copies of themselves and move to different positions on chromosomes. But, they discovered, when p53 is disabled by mutation, dramatic eruptions of these mobile elements occur. The study revealed that in mice with cancer and in human samples of two types of cancer (Wilms  tumors and colon tumors) disabled for p53, transposons became very active. In a healthy state, certain mechanisms work to keep these retroelements quiet and inactive, explained Dr. Abrams. One of those mechanisms is p53action. Conversely, when p53 is mutated, retroelements can erupt.  If you take the gene away, transposons can wreak havoc throughout the genome by causing it to become highly dysregulated, which can lead to disease,  Dr. Abrams said.  Our findings help explain why cancer genomes are so much more fluid and destabilized than normal genomes. They also provide a novel framework for understanding how normal cells become tumors.  Although much more research is needed, Dr. Abrams said, the potential clinical implications of the team s findings are significant.  Understanding how p53 prevents tumors raises the prospect of therapeutic interventions to correct cases in which p53 is disabled,  Dr. Abrams said.  If retroelements are at the heart of certain p53-driven cancers, finding ways to suppress them could potentially allow us to prevent those cancers or intervene to keep them from progressing.  This understanding also could lead to advances in diagnosing some cancers through biomarkers related to p53 and transposon activity.  One possibility is that perhaps blood or urine tests could detect dysregulated retroelements that could be indicative of certain types of cancer,  Dr. Abrams said.","Published: January 23, 2016"

Such a modified virus would travel from cell to cell in the brain lighting a path as it goes providing a kind of visual map of connections.  Researchers had struggled to find success, until eight years ago, when a team from the Salk Institute created an innovative new system.

This advance, while revolutionary, came with drawbacks. As an inoculation strain, this older rabies virus had evolved to kill neurons while sparing the organism. This caused neurons to die just a few days after infection too little time to construct an adequate map of a brain circuit.  It was like trying to draw a detailed map of New York City but you only had a minute to do so so you were left with a woefully incomplete picture,  said Thomas Reardon, the paper s co-first author and a doctoral candidate at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC).  So for this study, we looked to a different version of the virus, which would allow neurons to live much longer.  Learn More: Identification tags define neural circuits Working with acclaimed virologist Matthias Schnell, PhD, and his team at Thomas Jefferson University, the scientists took this strain of rabies and essentially neutered the virus so that it would still spread but without killing the organism. Using this new strain, neurons in the mouse brain lived for more than a month, allowing a greater window of time than ever before in which to map the circuit. The team could then direct the viral infection just as Salk scientists had done but without risking premature cell death.  While this strain is specific to the mouse brain, the applications for this advance are far-reaching,  said Attila Losonczy, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of neuroscience at CUMC, a principal investigator at the Zuckerman Institute and a co-senior author of this study.  For example, scientists could engineer a molecular payload, attach it to the modified rabies virus, and control specific neurons or groups of neurons   Ideally, we envision a strain of rabies virus that would be so safe and so malleable that we can enlist it to fight diseases of the brain,  said Andrew Murray, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at CUMC and the co-first author of the paper.  It is our hope that scientists can improve upon our strain and transform rabies virus into a vector to fight disease.   Our study also speaks to a broader theme in science: that the most revolutionary scientific tools do not originate in the lab, but instead come from nature itself,  added Reardon.  Evolution has already invented the rabies virus all we had to do was to co-opt it.  Columbia University  press release Reardon TR et al.

New research by Duke University scientists suggests that a habit leaves a lasting mark on specific circuits in the brain, priming us to feed our cravings. Published online in the journal Neuron, the research deepens scientists  understanding of how habits like sugar and other vices manifest in the brain and suggests new strategies for breaking them.  See Also: OCD patients' brains light up to reveal how compulsive habits develop  One day, we may be able to target these circuits in people to help promote habits that we want and kick out those that we don t want,  said the study s senior investigator Nicole Calakos, MD, PhD, an associate professor of neurology and neurobiology at the Duke University Medical Center.  Calakos, an expert in the brain s adaptability, teamed up with Henry Yin, an expert in animal models of habit behavior in Duke s department of psychology and neuroscience. Both scientists are also members of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences. Their groups trained otherwise healthy mice to form sugar habits of varying severity, a process that entailed pressing a lever to receive tiny sweets. The animals that became hooked kept pressing the lever even after the treats were removed.  The researchers then compared the brains of mice that had formed a habit to the ones that didn t. In particular, the team studied electrical activity in the basal ganglia, the complex network of brain areas that controls motor actions and compulsive behaviors, including drug addiction. In the basal ganglia, two main types of paths carry opposing messages: One carries a  go  signal which spurs an action, the other a  stop  signal.  Experiments by Duke neurobiology graduate student Justin O Hare found that the stop and go pathways were both more active in the sugar-habit mice. O Hare said he didn t expect to see the stop signal equally ramped up in the habit brains, because it has been traditionally viewed as the factor that helps prevent a behavior. The team also discovered a change in the timing of activation in the two pathways. In mice that had formed a habit, the go pathway turned on before the stop pathway. In non-habit brains, the stop signal preceded the go.  These changes in the brain circuitry were so long-lasting and obvious that it was possible for the group to predict which mice had formed a habit just by looking at isolated pieces of their brains in a petri dish. Scientists have previously noted that these opposing basal ganglia pathways seem to be in a race, though no one has shown that a habit gives the go pathway a head start. O Hare said that s because the go and stop signals had not been studied in the same brain at the same time. But new labeling strategies used by the Duke scientists allowed researchers to measure activity across dozens of neurons in both pathways simultaneously, in the same animal.   The go pathway s head start makes sense,  said Calakos.  It could prime the animal to be more likely to engage in the behavior.  The researchers are testing this idea, as well as investigating how the rearrangements in activity occur in the first place. Interestingly, the group observed that changes in go and stop activity occurred across the entire region of the basal ganglia they were studying as opposed to specific subsets of brain cells. O Hare said this may relate to the observation that an addiction to one thing can make a person more likely to engage in other unhealthy habits or addictions as well.  Learn More: Substance abuse reduces brain volume in women but not men To see if they could break a habit, the researchers encouraged the mice to change their habit by rewarding them only if they stopped pressing the lever. The mice that were the most successful at quitting had weaker go cells. But how this might translate into help for humans with bad habits is still unclear. Because the basal ganglia is involved in a broad array of functions, it may be tricky to target with medicines.  Calakos said some researchers are beginning to explore the possibility of treating drug addiction using transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS, a noninvasive technique that uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the brain.  TMS is an inroad to access these circuits in more severe diseases,  she said, in particular targeting the cortex, a brain area that serves as the main input to the basal ganglia.  For more ordinary bad habits  simpler, behavioral strategies many of us try may also tap into similar mechanisms,  Calakos added.  It may be just a matter of figuring out which of them are the most effective.  Meanwhile, Calakos and her team are studying what distinguishes ordinary habits from the problematic ones that can be seen in conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Conducted by scientists at the Institute for EthnoMedicine, a non-profit medical research organization, and the University of Miami Brain Endowment Bank, the study provides a foundation for future research in Alzheimer's disease, ALS and Parkinson's disease. Brain tangles and amyloid deposits are the hallmarks of both Alzheimer's disease and an unusual illness suffered by Chamorro villagers on the Pacific Island of Guam, whose diet is contaminated by the environmental toxin BMAA. Pacific Islanders with this unusual condition also suffer from dementia and symptoms similar to Alzheimer's disease, ALS and Parkinson's disease. The cause of neurodegenerative disease remains largely unknown, and the role of environmental factors in these illnesses is poorly understood. However, scientists have suspected a link between BMAA, a neurotoxin found in some harmful algal blooms, and neurodegenerative illness. ""Our findings show that chronic exposure to BMAA can trigger Alzheimer's-like brain tangles and amyloid deposits,"" said Paul Alan Cox, PhD, an ethnobotanist at the Institute for EthnoMedicine and lead author of the study. ""As far as we are aware, this is the first time researchers have been able to successfully produce brain tangles and amyloid deposits in an animal model through exposure to an environmental toxin."" Researchers conducted two experiments on vervets that lasted for 140 days. In the first experiment, vervets fed fruit dosed with BMAA developed neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid deposits similar to Pacific Islanders who died from the disease. Vervets fed equal amounts of L-BMAA and the dietary amino acid L-serine had a reduced density of tangles. Vervets fed a placebo dose did not develop neuropathology. A replication experiment was conducted which added a BMAA dose closer to the amount Chamorro villagers would be exposed to over a lifetime. The first group received fruit containing L-BMAA, the second group received fruit containing one-tenth of the regular dose of L-BMAA, the third group received fruit containing equal amounts of L-BMAA and L-serine, and the fourth group received fruit containing a placebo. ""This study takes a leap forward in showing causality that BMAA causes disease,"" said Deborah Mash, PhD, director of the University of Miami Brain Endowment Bank and co-author of the study. ""The tangles and amyloid deposits produced were nearly identical to those found in the brain tissue of the Pacific Islanders who died from the Alzheimer's-like disease."" After 140 days, tangles and amyloid deposits were found in the brain tissues of all of the vervets who consumed BMAA. However, there was a significant reduction in the density of tangles in those that consumed equal amounts of L-serine. Cox does not advocate patients taking L-serine at this time. ""The FDA has not approved its use for the treatment of neurodegenerative illness, and much more research is needed,"" he said. ""However, this new animal model may prove useful in evaluating other potential new Alzheimer's drugs."" The Institute has sponsored FDA-approved human clinical trials to study the effects of the naturally-occurring amino acid L-serine in people with ALS, and is working with Dartmouth Medical School to begin a Phase I human clinical trial of L-serine for patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or early stage Alzheimer's disease.

A careful balancing act plays out as digested food travels through the intestine. Immune cells must remain alert to protect against harmful pathogens like Salmonella, but their activity also needs to be tempered since an overreaction can lead to too much inflammation and permanent tissue damage. New research from Rockefeller University's assistant professor Daniel Mucida, head of the Laboratory of Mucosal Immunology, shows that neurons play a role in protecting intestinal tissue from over-inflammation. Published in Cell, the findings could have treatment implications for gastrointestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome. See Also: Migrating immune cells promote nerve cell demise in the brain ""Resistance to infections needs to be coupled with tolerance to the delicacy of the system,"" says Mucida, who led the research together with co-first authors Ilana Gabanyi, a postdoctoral associate, and Paul Muller, a graduate student. ""Our work identifies a mechanism by which neurons work with immune cells to help intestinal tissue respond to perturbations without going too far."" Different populations of macrophages are among the many types of immune cells present in intestinal tissue. Lamina propria macrophages are found very close to the lining of the intestinal tube, while muscularis macrophages are in a deeper tissue layer, more distant from what passes through the intestine. Using an imaging technique developed by Marc Tessier-Lavigne's Laboratory of Brain Development and Repair that allows scientists to view cellular structures three-dimensionally, the researchers looked in depth at the differences between the two populations. In addition to variations in how the cells look and move, they noticed that intestinal neurons are surrounded by macrophages. When Mucida and colleagues analyzed the genes that are expressed in the two macrophage populations, they found that lamina propria macrophages preferentially express pro-inflammatory genes. In contrast, the muscularis macrophages preferentially express anti-inflammatory genes, and these are boosted when intestinal infections occur. Learn More: Head injury causes the immune system to attack the brain ""We wanted to know where this signal was coming from that induced this different response to infection,"" says Mucida. ""We came to the conclusion that one of the main signals seems to come from neurons, which appear in our imaging to almost be hugged by the muscularis macrophages."" In other experiments, the scientists found that muscularis macrophages carry receptors on their surface that allow them to respond to norepinephrine, a signaling substance produced by neurons. The presence of the receptor might indicate a mechanism by which neurons signal to the immune cells to put a stop to inflammation. The researchers also observed that the muscularis macrophages are activated within one to two hours following an infection significantly faster than a response would take if it were completely immunological, not mediated by neurons. They believe that was because these deeply embedded macrophages receive signals from neurons, they are able to respond rapidly to an infection, even though they are not in direct contact with the pathogen. ""We now have a much better picture of how the communication between neurons and macrophages in the intestine helps to prevent potential damage from inflammation,"" says Mucida. ""It's plausible that a severe infection could disrupt this pathway, leading to the tissue damage and permanent gastrointestinal changes that are seen in diseases like irritable bowel syndrome. These findings could be harnessed in the future to develop treatments for such diseases."" The Rockefeller University  press release Gabanyi I et al.

The findings appear in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. See Also: Self-repairing mechanism can help to preserve brain function in neurodegenerative diseases Neurotrophins, or proteins that promote the development of neurons, have been investigated as potential therapeutic agents, but they have a variety of drawbacks. A group of small molecule natural products, however, possesses potent neurotrophic properties without some of the shortcomings of protein-based agents. Unfortunately, a source of suitable quantities of these substances to enable thorough medicinal exploration has yet to be identified. As such, the development of synthetic processes to generate molecules in this class (and related unnatural analogs) is critically important to establish science capable of fueling the discovery of therapeutic agents within the class. That said, many member of this natural product class boast very complex carbocyclic structures that have stood as substantial challenges to modern synthetic chemistry. Now, Dartmouth researchers have discovered that one of their recently discovered chemical reactions is capable of delivering some of the most potent and rare members of this natural product class. Their pursuits resulted in the laboratory preparation of three neurotrophic natural products in the class and demonstrated the first application of their new carbocycle-forming reaction in natural product synthesis. In addition to these accomplishments, the researchers' study also led to the discovery of a new radical cascade reaction process that proved instrumental for completing their laboratory syntheses of these complex agents.

Because pancreatic cancer has one of the worse prognoses of any cancer and is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., according to the National Cancer Institute, researchers for years have sought to find better treatment options. Last year, the FDA approved the first cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor for treating a certain type of advanced breast cancer. This class of drugs has been widely studied in clinical trials for many other types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer. CDK 4/6 inhibitors are cytostatic, meaning they work by preventing cancer cells from growing and dividing.  On the one hand, that s great, because the tumor won t grow, but on the other hand, the patient still has a tumor, which will eventually become resistant to those drugs,  said study senior author Dr. Erik Knudsen, Professor of Internal Medicine in the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development at UT Southwestern.  There s a lot of interest in better understanding the biology behind CDK4/6 inhibitors   and in finding out whether we can use that information to kill tumors instead of simply stopping their growth,  added Dr. Agnieszka Witkiewicz, also in the McDermott Center and an Associate Professor of Pathology. In this study, the research team treated human pancreatic cancer cells and tumors grown in mice with CDK4/6-inhibiting drugs. Surprisingly, they found that when tumor cells were treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors, the cells  metabolism   the way cancer tumors get energy   became more active.  Now we can try attacking specific aspects of CDK4/6-induced metabolic programming,  said Dr. Knudsen, also a member of UT Southwestern s Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, along with Dr. Witkiewicz.  For example, by targeting altered tumor metabolism, we could potentially turn the cytostatic effect of CDK4/6 inhibitors into a cytotoxic effect that actually kills the cancer cells.  The upshot is that by disrupting a tumor s cell cycle with CDK4/6 inhibitors and then targeting the altered metabolism with other drugs   such as mTOR inhibitors   it may be possible to positively impact cancer treatment.  These data yield valuable new insights into the cross talk between CDK inhibitors, signaling pathways, and tumor metabolism in pancreatic cancer, opening up some interesting new possibilities for treatment that could be evaluated in clinical trials,  Dr. Witkiewicz said.  The real goal is that this work   as well as ongoing studies   will benefit patients with pancreatic cancer. ","Published: January 22, 2016"

Depression in women during pregnancy is known to be associated with low birthweight and increased risk of premature birth. Maternal stress, such as the death of a loved one, lack of social support, or a difficult or abusive relationship, has also been shown to increase the risk of premature birth. However, little research has examined the impact of paternal depression on the health of the mother or the unborn child. See Also: Subtle but important memory function affected by preterm birth In this study, more than 350,000 births in Sweden between 2007 and 2012 were investigated for parental depression and incidences of either very preterm birth (between 22 and 31 weeks) or moderately preterm birth (32-36 weeks). For both men and women, depression was defined as having had a prescription of antidepressant medication, or receiving outpatient/inpatient hospital care, from 12 months before conception to the end of the second trimester of pregnancy. People with depression were classed as  new  cases if they had had no depression in the 12 months prior to diagnosis, all other cases were defined as  recurrent  depression. While both new and recurrent depression in the mothers was associated with an increased risk of moderately preterm birth of around 30% to 40%, new depression in the fathers was associated with a 38% increased risk of very preterm birth. Recurrent depression in the fathers was not associated with preterm birth at all.  Depression of a partner can be considered to be a substantial source of stress for an expectant mother, and this may result in the increased risk of very preterm birth seen in our study. Paternal depression is also known to affect sperm quality, have epigenetic effects on the DNA of the baby, and can also affect placenta function. However, this risk seems to be reduced for recurrent paternal depression, indicating that perhaps treatment for the depression reduces the risk of preterm birth,"" Professor Anders Hjern, from the Centre for Health Equity Studies in Stockholm (CHESS), says.  For the mothers, depression increased the risk of preterm birth, regardless of whether the depression was new or recurrent. Our results suggest that both maternal and paternal depression should be considered in preterm birth prevention strategies and both parents should be screened for mental health problems. Since men are less likely to seek professional help for any mental health problems, a proactive approach towards targeting the wellbeing of expectant fathers may be beneficial.

The new work also answers a longstanding question as to how the brain is so energy efficient and could help engineers build computers that are incredibly powerful but also conserve energy. ""This is a real bombshell in the field of neuroscience,"" says Terry Sejnowski, Salk professor and co-senior author of the paper, which was published in eLife. ""We discovered the key to unlocking the design principle for how hippocampal neurons function with low energy but high computation power. Our new measurements of the brain's memory capacity increase conservative estimates by a factor of 10 to at least a petabyte, in the same ballpark as the World Wide Web."" See Also: Electric current to brain boosts memory Our memories and thoughts are the result of patterns of electrical and chemical activity in the brain. A key part of the activity happens when our neurons interact at synapses where an axon from one neuron connects to the dendrite of another and signals travel across the synapses via neurotransmitters. Each neuron can have thousands of synapses with thousands of other neurons. ""When we first reconstructed every dendrite, axon, glial process, and synapse from a volume of hippocampus the size of a single red blood cell, we were somewhat bewildered by the complexity and diversity amongst the synapses,"" says Kristen Harris, co-senior author of the work and professor of neuroscience at the University of Texas, Austin. ""While I had hoped to learn fundamental principles about how the brain is organized from these detailed reconstructions, I have been truly amazed at the precision obtained in the analyses of this report."" Synapses are still a mystery, though their dysfunction can cause a range of neurological diseases. Larger synapses with more surface area and vesicles of neurotransmitters are stronger, making them more likely to activate their surrounding neurons than medium or small synapses. The Salk team, while building a 3D reconstruction of rat hippocampus tissue (the memory center of the brain), noticed something unusual. In some cases, a single axon from one neuron formed two synapses reaching out to a single dendrite of a second neuron, signifying that the first neuron seemed to be sending a duplicate message to the receiving neuron. At first, the researchers didn't think much of this duplicity, which occurs about 10 percent of the time in the hippocampus. But Tom Bartol, a Salk staff scientist, had an idea: if they could measure the difference between two very similar synapses such as these, they might glean insight into synaptic sizes, which so far had only been classified in the field as small, medium and large. To do this, researchers used advanced microscopy and computational algorithms they had developed to image rat brains and reconstruct the connectivity, shapes, volumes and surface area of the brain tissue down to a nanomolecular level. The scientists expected the synapses would be roughly similar in size, but were surprised to discover the synapses were nearly identical. ""We were amazed to find that the difference in the sizes of the pairs of synapses were very small, on average, only about eight percent different in size. No one thought it would be such a small difference. This was a curveball from nature,"" says Bartol. Learn More: Children with autism have extra synapses in brain Because the memory capacity of neurons is dependent upon synapse size, this eight percent difference turned out to be a key number the team could then plug into their algorithmic models of the brain to measure how much information could potentially be stored in synaptic connections. It was known before that the range in sizes between the smallest and largest synapses was a factor of 60 and that most are small. But armed with the knowledge that synapses of all sizes could vary in increments as little as eight percent between sizes within a factor of 60, the team determined there could be about 26 categories of sizes of synapses, rather than just a few. ""Our data suggests there are 10 times more discrete sizes of synapses than previously thought,"" says Bartol. In computer terms, 26 sizes of synapses correspond to about 4.7 ""bits"" of information. Previously, it was thought that the brain was capable of just one to two bits for short and long memory storage in the hippocampus. ""This is roughly an order of magnitude of precision more than anyone has ever imagined,"" says Sejnowski. In a computational reconstruction of brain tissue in the hippocampus, the scientists found the unusual occurrence of two synapses from the axon of one neuron (translucent black strip) forming onto two spines on the same dendrite of a second neuron (yellow). Separate terminals from one neuron's axon are shown in synaptic contact with two spines (arrows) on the same dendrite of a second neuron in the hippocampus. The spine head volumes, synaptic contact areas (red), neck diameters (gray) and number of presynaptic vesicles (white spheres) of these two synapses are almost identical. Credit: Salk Institute  What makes this precision puzzling is that hippocampal synapses are notoriously unreliable. When a signal travels from one neuron to another, it typically activates that second neuron only 10 to 20 percent of the time. ""We had often wondered how the remarkable precision of the brain can come out of such unreliable synapses,"" says Bartol. One answer, it seems, is in the constant adjustment of synapses, averaging out their success and failure rates over time. The team used their new data and a statistical model to find out how many signals it would take a pair of synapses to get to that eight percent difference. The researchers calculated that for the smallest synapses, about 1,500 events cause a change in their size/ability (20 minutes) and for the largest synapses, only a couple hundred signaling events (1 to 2 minutes) cause a change. ""This means that every 2 or 20 minutes, your synapses are going up or down to the next size. The synapses are adjusting themselves according to the signals they receive,"" says Bartol. ""Our prior work had hinted at the possibility that spines and axons that synapse together would be similar in size, but the reality of the precision is truly remarkable and lays the foundation for whole new ways to think about brains and computers,"" says Harris. ""The work resulting from this collaboration has opened a new chapter in the search for learning and memory mechanisms."" Harris adds that the findings suggest more questions to explore, for example, if similar rules apply for synapses in other regions of the brain and how those rules differ during development and as synapses change during the initial stages of learning. ""The implications of what we found are far-reaching,"" adds Sejnowski. ""Hidden under the apparent chaos and messiness of the brain is an underlying precision to the size and shapes of synapses that was hidden from us."" The findings also offer a valuable explanation for the brain's surprising efficiency. The waking adult brain generates only about 20 watts of continuous power--as much as a very dim light bulb. The Salk discovery could help computer scientists build ultraprecise, but energy-efficient, computers, particularly ones that employ ""deep learning"" and artificial neural nets techniques capable of sophisticated learning and analysis, such as speech, object recognition and translation. ""This trick of the brain absolutely points to a way to design better computers,"" says Sejnowski. ""Using probabilistic transmission turns out to be as accurate and require much less energy for both computers and brains."" Salk Institute  press release Bartol Jr TM et al.

These findings have implications for predicting language learning success and failure,  said study author Xiaoqian Chai. See Also: A dominant hemisphere for handedness and language? The various regions of our brains communicate with each other even when we are resting and aren t engaged in any specific tasks. The strength of these connections called resting-state connectivity varies from person to person, and differences have previously been linked to differences in behavior including language ability. Led by Chai and Denise Klein, researchers at McGill University explored whether differences in resting-state connectivity relate to performance in a second language. To study this, the group at the Montreal Neurological Institute scanned the brains of 15 adult English speakers who were about to begin an intensive 12-week French course, and then tested their language abilities both before and after the course. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the researchers examined the connectivity within the subjects  brains prior to the start of the French course. They looked at the strength of connections between various areas in the brain and two specific language regions: an area of the brain implicated in verbal fluency, the left anterior insula/frontal operculum (AI/FO), and an area active in reading, the visual word form area (VWFA).   The researchers tested the participants  verbal fluency and reading speed both prior to the course and after its completion. To test verbal fluency, the researchers gave subjects a prompt and asked them to speak for two minutes in French. The researchers counted the number of unique words that were used correctly. To test reading speed, the researchers had participants read French passages aloud, and they calculated the number of words read per minute. Learn More: Presence or absence of early language delay alters anatomy of the brain in autism Participants with stronger connections between the left AI/FO and an important region of the brain s language network called the left superior temporal gyrus showed greater improvement in the speaking test. Participants with greater connectivity between the VWFA and a different area of the left superior temporal gyrus language area in the left temporal lobe showed greater improvement in reading speed by the end of the 12-week course.  The most interesting part of this finding is that the connectivity between the different areas was observed before learning,  said Arturo Hernandez, a neuroscientist at the University of Houston who studies second-language learning and was not involved in the study.  This shows that some individuals may have a particular neuronal activity pattern that may lend itself to better learning of a second language.  However, that doesn t mean success at a second language is entirely predetermined by the brain s wiring. The brain is very plastic, meaning that it can be shaped by learning and experience, Chai said. The study is  a first step to understanding individual differences in second language learning,  she added.  In the long term it might help us to develop better methods for helping people to learn better.  Society for Neuroscience  press release Chai XJ et al.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/mapping-out-cell-conversion-200210,Mapping out Cell Conversion Researchers develop algorithm that takes the field of cell reprogramming forward  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. An international team of researchers from the Duke-NUS Medical School (Duke-NUS), the University of Bristol, Monash University and RIKEN have developed an algorithm that can predict the factors required to convert one human cell type to another. These game-changing findings have significant implications for regenerative medicine and lay the groundwork for further research into cell reprogramming. It is known that cell types are not fixed, and that one cell type can be reprogrammed, or converted, to become another cell type by the addition of a unique set of cellular factors. This approach was brought to the fore by Shinya Yamanaka, whose Nobel prize-winning work involved the reprogramming of fibroblast cells from the skin to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS). In theory, iPS could then be directly reprogrammed to become, for instance, retinal cells that could help treat macular or eye degeneration. In practice though, it seems there are technical and safety concerns with this approach of cell conversion due to the accumulation of cancerous mutations in the reprogrammed cells, therefore leading to unpredictable behaviour.In addition, despite this breakthrough, determining the unique set of cellular factors that is needed to be manipulated for each cell conversion is a long and costly process that involved much trial and error. As a result, this first step of identifying the key set of cellular factors for cell conversion is the major obstacle researchers and doctors face in the field of cell reprogramming. In order to overcome this obstacle, Duke-NUS Senior Research Fellow Dr Owen Rackham worked for five years to develop a computational algorithm to predict the cellular factors for cell conversions. The algorithm, called Mogrify(1), is able to predict the optimal set of cellular factors required for any given cell conversion. When tested, Mogrify was able to accurately predict the set of cellular factors required for previously published cell conversions correctly. To further validate Mogrify's predictive ability, the team conducted two novel cell conversions in the laboratory using human cells, and these were successful in both attempts solely using the predictions of Mogrify. ""Mogrify acts like a 'world atlas' for the cell and allows us to map out new territories in cell conversions in humans,"" explained Dr Rackham, who is from the Systems Genetics of Complex Disease Laboratory at Duke-NUS. ""One of the first clinical applications that we hope to achieve with this innovative approach would be to reprogramme 'defective' cells from patients into 'functioning' healthy cells, without the intermediate iPS step. These then can be re-implanted into patients, and should, in practice, effectively enable new regenerative medicine techniques."" Associate Professor Enrico Petretto, co-author of the study and head of the Systems Genetics of Complex Disease Laboratory in the Centre for Computational Biology at Duke-NUS, highlighted that since Mogrify is completely data-driven, its robustness and accuracy can only continue to improve as more comprehensive data are collected and input into the framework. ""Mogrify is a game-changing method that leverages big-data and systems-biology; this will inspire new translational applications as the result of the work and expertise here at Duke-NUS,"" said Assoc Prof Petretto.

But if supplies of these materials run low, the cell will enter a suspended state called senescence and cell division will stop, freezing the advance of the virus, according to new findings from a Duke University research team. The first virus shown to cause cancer in humans, Epstein-Barr (EBV) has long been a puzzle to researchers. It is found in more than 90 percent of adults worldwide, yet only a small proportion of people ever succumb to the lymphomas and other cancers the virus can cause.  A big part of the answer is the body s immune system, said lead study author Micah Luftig, an associate professor of molecular genetics and microbiology in the Duke School of Medicine, and deputy director of Duke s Center for Virology. For the most part, a healthy immune system stops Epstein-Barr virus from making much headway, Luftig said. In fact, many of the cancers linked to EBV are found mostly in immune-compromised patients whose ability to fight it off has been weakened. But another answer may be this newly discovered senescence trigger, Luftig added.  Using a new technology that allows researchers to see what state of maturation individual cells are in, the team could see variations in the activity of viral genes from one cell to the next.  They found that the EBV is able to switch the cell s fuel source to keep the cells proliferating even as they chew up their internal parts to create more building supplies.  So the team tried making B-cells sense they were starving by using the drug Rapamycin. The strategy worked well enough that they could turn the senescence of EBV-infected cells on and off.","Published: January 21, 2016"

The Rice lab of bioengineer David Zhang introduced a method that cuts the time required to analyze the thermal behaviors of DNA and RNA strands from months to hours. The open-access method will help scientists build a universal database of biophysical properties of genetic molecules. Typically, to study the behavior of a particular DNA sequence - for example, one that is specific to a virus -- researchers would heat and cool the molecules to observe their fluorescence at different temperatures. This technique is known as a melting curve analysis. Using rules of thumb, researchers would then guess the DNA's properties at temperatures other than the one measured. However, such approaches are inaccurate because the way a DNA molecule behaves at 75 degrees Celsius is a poor predictor of how it behaves at 37 C, Zhang said. ""Our goal is to build a database of good DNA and RNA thermodynamic parameters. Melt curves done in the '80s and '90s are too crude,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, that's what people in diagnostic and life-sciences research use today because there's been no better method. ""Our main innovation is that we have developed a way to measure exact thermodynamics at the temperatures and other conditions we care about. We are studying DNA 'in the wild' rather than observing DNA molecules that have been locked up in an overheated cage."" Animals in the wild are hard to study because they can take a long time to come into a camera's field of view. The same observational challenge applies to the study of DNA in its native conditions, Zhang said. ""Typically, it would take months of observing until a researcher is able to find the true state of the DNA, and that's too long to wait,"" he said. ""We have developed a system that helps us quickly zoom in on the DNA molecules being studied. Typically, because we are speeding the reaction up 10,000- or even 100,000-fold, we only have to wait a couple of hours to do our analysis."" Zhang said that while their technique is more labor-intensive than a melting curve, it generates far more accurate results, as proven by the hundreds of molecules his lab has already analyzed. The errors that the research team has encountered are roughly tenfold lower than previous methods; this allows for more accurate rational design of DNA diagnostic reagents. A high-resolution melt experiment would have to be repeated dozens of times to generate an average result with close to the same precision, he said, but even that would not mitigate errors from testing under unrealistic conditions. The Rice method is the first for which Zhang's lab will not seek a patent. ""This is something I feel is beneficial to the entire world,"" he said. ""I want people to use this so we can build thermodynamic databases together. We've basically started the process of forming the database, but we're nowhere near the end.""","Published: January 21, 2016"

The technique allows researchers to patch an abnormal section of DNA with the normal sequence and potentially correct the defect and is already working in cell culture to improve ongoing efforts to repair defective genes.  The exciting thing about CRISPR-Cas9 is the promise of fixing genes in place in our genome, but the efficiency for that can be very low,  said Jacob Corn, scientific director of the Innovative Genomics Initiative at UC Berkeley, a group that focuses on next-generation genome editing and gene regulation for lab and clinical application.  If you think of gene editing as a word processor, we know how to cut, but we need a more efficient way to paste and glue a new piece of DNA where we make the cut.   In cases where you want to change very small regions of DNA, up to 30 base pairs, this technique would be extremely effective,  said first author Christopher Richardson, an IGI postdoc. Problems in short sections of DNA, including single base-pair mutations, are typical of many genetic diseases. Base pairs are the individual building blocks of DNA, strung end-to-end in a strand that coils around a complementary strand to make the well-known helical, double-stranded DNA molecule. Grabbing onto a loose strand Richardson invented the new approach after finding that the Cas9 protein, which does the actual DNA cutting, remains attached to the chromosome for up to six hours, long after it has sliced through the double-stranded DNA. Richardson looked closely at the Cas9 protein bound to the two strands of DNA and discovered that while the protein hangs onto three of the cut ends, one of the ends remains free. Jennifer Doudna explains how CRISPR-Cas9 edits genes. Video by Roxanne Makasdjian and Stephen McNally, UC Berkeley. When Cas9 cuts DNA, repair systems in the cell can grab a piece of complementary DNA, called a template, to repair the cut. Researchers can add templates containing changes that alter existing sequences in the genome   for example, correcting a disease-causing mutation. Richardson reasoned that bringing the substitute template directly to the site of the cut would improve the patching efficiency, and constructed a piece of DNA that matches the free DNA end and carries the genetic sequence to be inserted at the other end. The technique worked extremely well, allowing successful repair of a mutation with up to 60 percent efficiency.  Our data indicate that Cas9 breaks could be different at a molecular level from breaks generated by other targeted nucleases, such as TALENS and zinc-finger nucleases, which suggests that strategies like the ones we are using can give you more efficient repair of Cas9 breaks,  Richardson said. The researchers also showed that variants of the Cas9 protein that bind DNA but donot cut also can successfully paste a new DNA sequence at the binding site, possibly by forming a  bubble  structure on the target DNA that also acts to attract the repair template. Gene editing using Cas9 without genome cutting could be safer than typical gene editing by removing the danger of off-target cutting in the genome, Corn said.","Published: January 21, 2016"

The current patient follow-up process using tele-monitoring is very inefficient and human resource intensive - a potential risk factor in quality of patient care and an obstacle for extending the enrolment of tele-monitored patients. Nurses and physicians are confronted on a daily basis with the complexity of having to manage a variety of different tele-monitoring systems from several vendors in order to properly follow-up large numbers of patients.  LindaCare s mission is to help healthcare professionals and hospitals reduce the cost of delivery of care and improve quality of care and patient safety for chronic disease management, by simplifying patient follow-up through tele-monitoring,  said Shahram Sharif, CEO and founder of LindaCare. LindaCare s first version of the product is a web-based software platform for the tele-monitoring of patients with CIEDs and suffering from chronic heart failure (CHF) and cardiac arrhythmia; this accounts for an estimated total of about 10 million patients worldwide today. UZ Leuven, with about 2.000 beds and employing 9.000 professionals, has been providing high quality and innovative medical care for more than 75 years, and is considered to be one of the largest academic and most innovative hospital groups in Europe. Moreover, the terms of the agreement extend the benefits to  nexuz health , a medical collaborative alliance currently comprising 17 hospitals across the Flanders region. The collaboration agreement provides LindaCare with deep insight into current clinical practice around patient tele-monitoring while bringing innovative solutions to the clinicians at UZ Leuven to improve quality of care.

The trials will be led by world-leading expert in RSV and member of Mucosis s Scientific Advisory Board, Professor Peter Openshaw FRCP FMedSci and Dr. Christopher Chiu of the National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London. Professor Peter Openshaw, Professor of Experimental Medicine at Imperial College London and Honorary Physician in the Department of Respiratory Medicine at the St Mary's Campus of the Imperial College NHS Trust welcomed the news, commenting  RSV is one of the few major infectious diseases for which there is still no vaccine. Contracting under Mucosis, this funding will enable us to analyze the immune responses generated by SynGEM  and increase our understanding of protective immunity in the respiratory system.  RSV is a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and represents a large unmet medical need. According to the WHO (1), the global RSV disease burden is estimated at 64 million cases and 160,000 deaths every year, as well as associated increased allergy and asthma rates. While RSV infects all age groups, the most severe cases occur in the elderly, patients with chronic lung disease, individuals with impaired immunity and very young infants. The Wellcome Trust translational fund award will be used to fund a Phase I dose-finding and safety study, followed by a novel phase II challenge study to assess the efficacy of the SynGEM  vaccine against controlled infection with RSV. SynGEM  is based on Mucosis s proprietary bacterium-like-particle (BLP) based Mimopath  platform, which allows the vaccine to be delivered via mucosal routes, primarily the nose, making the vaccine needle-free. The BLPs carry a unique stable prefusion form of the F vaccine antigen, which has been shown to raise more potent neutralizing antibodies against RSV compared with the postfusion F antigen. SynGEM  is able to elicit the production of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies more effectively than intramuscular injections because a higher concentration of IgA is produced in mucosal linings than all other types of antibody combined in the blood. There is evidence that IgA plays an important role in the defence against RSV in humans, making SynGEM  more effective as a vaccine against RSV.  We are delighted that the Wellcome Trust has recognized the potential of SynGEM  to address the global health challenge of combatting RSV infections by contributing funds to this program,  said Tom Johnston, CEO of Mucosis.  SynGEM  has performed exceptionally well in pre-clinical trials and we are pleased to have secured additional funding to more quickly advance a needle-free vaccine for RSV into the clinic.  Mucosis also secured  2m additional equity financing from its current investors. These funds will enable Mucosis to complete GMP manufacturing, and to advance the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier (IMPD) submission materials for clinical trial approval in 2016. Together with an earlier secured  5m from the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO) for the development of SynGEM , Mucosis is now in an excellent position to advance its clinical program.","Published: January 21, 2016"

Few studies have assessed the safety of raspberry ketone. The substance 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone, which is popularly known as raspberry ketone, gives raspberries most of their flavour. The substance has been approved for use as a flavouring substance in foods in very small quantities. The raspberry ketone content in the fresh fruit is very small: One kilo of fresh raspberries contains 0.009-4.3 mg raspberry ketone. Therefore food manufacturers mainly use raspberry ketone which has been chemically produced with the help of microorganisms. Little knowledge about the intake of large dosesAn adult s average daily intake of raspberry ketone through the diet is between 1.8 and 3.8 mg and most of it comes from its use as a flavouring agent. However, the substance is also found in certain weight-loss supplements, which can be purchased online. Producers of these products recommend a daily dose of between 100 and 1400 mg. While the substance has been approved as a flavouring substance, no Danish or international authorities have approved the safety of using large doses of the substance as a weight-loss supplement. According to a team of researchers from the National Food Institute the problem is that the safety of such large daily intakes has never been assessed. Weight loss has been observed in laboratory animals in a few studies, but the reason behind this weight loss is unknown. Toxicologists generally see a weight loss in laboratory animals as an indicator of an adverse effect if the mechanism behind the weight loss is not known. Using computers to map out adverse effectsIn order to better understand the possible effects of the substance the researchers have made use of QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship). With the help of advanced computer models it is possible to predict what adverse effects a substance may have based on whether the chemical structure of the substance is similar to substances that have already been tested. QSAR has indicated that the substance may have potential adverse effects on both the reproductive and cardiovascular systems as well as on fetal development. Therefore the substance should be further examined in order to determine whether it is safe to use in the high doses found in weight-loss supplements. As such consumers should exercise caution when using products containing raspberry ketone. According to researcher Lea Bredsdorff the assessment of raspberry ketone is a good example of how the QSAR tool can be used in situations where little safety data is available in order to get an idea about the potential adverse effects of a substance. The name is crucialIn the online marketing of weight-loss products containing raspberry ketone they are described as 100% natural, which gives the impression that the substance has been extracted from the fruit. However, the safety of the substance is not dependent on whether it has been extracted from the fruit or it has been industrially manufactured. It is not legal for weight-loss supplements containing raspberry ketone to be sold in Danish stores.","Published: January 21, 2016"

The results show a surprisingly high heritability of the long-term risk of developing social anxiety,  says Fartein Ask Torvik, a researcher in the Department of Genetics, Environment and Mental Health at the institute. It has long been known that both genetics and the environment play a role in the development of social anxiety, but researchers have been previously unaware of the strong effect of genetic factors over time. See Also: Anxiety and the ability to predict an outcome For over a decade, the NIPH has followed approximately 3000 Norwegian twins to find out more about how mental disorders develop over time. The results for social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder among women are now available. Twins were studied so that researchers can see the extent to which the disorders are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The women were interviewed twice   once when they were in their twenties and once in their thirties.  Social anxiety is known to have an early onset, often in adolescence. Social anxiety usually does not appear after your mid-twenties if you have not had it before,  says Torvik. Just under 4 per cent of participants had social anxiety disorder in their twenties. Another ten per cent had symptoms that did not qualify for a diagnosis. Ten years later, five per cent and just under nine per cent respectively had social anxiety disorder or its symptoms. It was not necessarily the same people who had social anxiety in their twenties and thirties.  The anxiety was less stable than expected. Two-thirds of those who had social anxiety when they were interviewed in their twenties no longer met the diagnostic criteria when they were interviewed ten years later. It appears to fluctuate for individuals, says Torvik.  However, the prevalence was not lower in the thirties than in the twenties, since other people had the disorder again when they were interviewed  he adds. Social anxiety is the fear of being negatively evaluated in social situations. Many people experience this occasionally and it is considered to be normal. Anxiety only qualifies as a diagnosis when it becomes marked enough to prevent normal social interactions.  Social anxiety disorder or social phobia can lead to persistent and significant distress and impairment in important areas of functioning,  says Torvik. Avoidant personality disorder often occurs together with social anxiety, but the study suggests that this personality disorder is not the same as strong social anxiety.  The risk of developing social anxiety is associated with avoidant personality traits. These traits can lead to avoiding the feared situations. Many also use safety behaviours to cover or control their anxiety. In the long term this could lead to more anxiety,  says Torvik. Learn More: Breaking the anxiety cycle Looking at the long-term risk of developing social anxiety, the risk is strongly influenced by genetic factors. This is probably because personality traits that predispose to the disorder, such as introversion and low emotional stability, are influenced by genetics. If you have both of these traits, the risk of developing social anxiety is high. However, at any particular moment, the environment will have the greatest impact on whether you have social anxiety. The events that affect social anxiety in the twenties have little effect in the thirties. The environment has the strongest effect in the short term, and the impact of most experiences will pass. When researchers looked at the causes of stability and change over time, they found that the genetic risk was persistent and contributed to the stability, while the environment largely contributed to change.  Social anxiety is highly heritable. While environmental factors are most significant in the short term, your genes play a crucial role over time, says Torvik.  This means that the impact of environmental events, such as being bullied or losing a job, is of limited duration. The effect of the events that cause social anxiety at one point will pass. The fact that social anxiety disorder is so unstable should give hope for those who are struggling with it,  he adds. For long-term risk associated with genes, the findings show that the risk cannot completely be avoided:  If you have avoidant personality traits, you have a high risk of experiencing social anxiety in periods. Even people who have had a good, secure upbringing can experience social anxiety. However, if you have an inherited risk, you can learn to defy the tendency of avoidance and know what to do if the anxiety appears. Although the genetic risk is long-lasting, it does not mean that you have to live with the symptoms. There are good treatments for social anxiety. The treatment involves exposure to the feared situations and acknowledging your anxiety.  Norwegian Institute of Public Health  press release Torvik FA et al.

The finding, based on a study performed at the University of Chicago sleep laboratory published online by the journal Diabetes Care, could affect large numbers of people who work long hours. See Also: Expert Panel Recommends New Sleep Durations The pattern of cutting back on sleep during the work week followed by catching up on sleep over the weekend is common. Even short-term sleep restriction, with four or five hours of sleep per night, can increase the risk of developing diabetes by about 16 percent comparable to the increase in risk caused by obesity. ""In this short-term study, we found that two long nights spent catching up on lost sleep can reverse the negative metabolic effects of four consecutive nights of restricted sleep,"" said study author Josiane Broussard, PhD, now an assistant research professor in the Department of Integrative Physiology at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The researchers recruited 19 volunteers, all healthy young men. On one occasion, they were allowed to sleep normally, spending 8.5 hours in bed for four nights. On another occasion, the same volunteers were first sleep deprived, allowed only 4.5 hours in bed for four consecutive nights. They spent an average of 4.3 of those hours asleep each night. Subsequently, they were allowed 2 nights of extended sleep, during which they averaged 9.7 hours of sleep. Investigators then determined the subjects' insulin sensitivity the ability of insulin to regulate blood sugars and the disposition index, a predictor of diabetes risk. After four nights of sleep restriction, the volunteers' insulin sensitivity decreased by 23 percent and their diabetes risk increased by 16 percent. After two nights of extended sleep, however, insulin sensitivity and the risk of diabetes returned to normal sleep levels. Learn More: Sleep in a dish: Researchers isolate smallest unit of sleep to date ""The metabolic response to this extra sleep was very interesting and encouraging,"" said senior author Esra Tasali, MD, associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago. ""It shows that young, healthy people who sporadically fail to get sufficient sleep during the work week can reduce their diabetes risk if they catch up on sleep during the weekend."" ""Though this is evidence that weekend catch-up sleep may help someone recover from a sleep-deprived week,"" Broussard said, ""this was not a long-term study and our subjects went through this process only once. Going forward we intend to study the effects of extended weekend sleep schedules in people who repeatedly curtail their weekday sleep."" Increased risk of developing diabetes is not the only drawback associated with inadequate sleep, the authors point out. The volunteers in this study were given a calorie-controlled diet, but sleep-deprived adults outside the laboratory setting tend to eat more, with a strong preference for sweets and high-fat foods. Chronically sleep deprived people are more likely to develop other health problems such as increased inflammation and high blood pressure. They also show cognitive problems, tend to be less alert and have difficulty concentrating, reasoning and solving problems. They are prone to traffic accidents. The impact of extra weekend sleep on other adverse health and safety outcomes remains to be determined. The University of Chicago, Medicine   press release Broussard JL et al.

Amarantus shall have the right to appoint two directors to the Avant Board of Directors, and will assist Avant in bolstering its product development and commercialization resources to accelerate the further development of the combined company's product pipeline. The transaction is expected to be finalized in the second quarter of 2016, and is subject to customary closing conditions. The proposed merger will create the opportunity to progress highly valuable diagnostic assets in the areas of oncology and neurology. The combined assets have as their common element the potential to provide early and actionable information to physicians and researchers by harnessing the power of biomarkers based in the immune system in disease areas that previously yielded results of limited value. Bringing these assays to market in a standalone diagnostics-focused entity has the potential to improve the practice of medicine by providing new proprietary diagnosis and monitoring tools for oncologists and neurologists: 1. Avant Diagnostics' OvaDx  immuno-oncology diagnostic assay is a protein-based test, potentially representing a significant improvement in the screening and diagnosis for ovarian cancer. OvaDx offers the possibility to make a clear improvement to the current diagnostic standard that generates over $2B in sales annually by substantially improving the accuracy of diagnosis, and allowing for a more effective therapeutic triaging and intervention strategy. Longer term, the assay could become a much-needed early screening tool for all women as part of a standard screening paradigm. It is estimated that the market opportunity for OvaDx is $50M annually as a diagnostic test for ovarian cancer, and this opportunity would expand to over $2B annually if it were to be approved as a generalized screening and/or monitoring tool. 2. Amarantus Diagnostics' MSPrecise  neuroimmunology-based next-gen sequencing diagnostic assay for multiple sclerosis (MS) offers a potentially highly accurate and actionable result that will substantially improve upon the high mis-diagnosis rate of this degenerative disease. Improving the diagnostic accuracy rate in MS will be a key driver to more effective therapeutic strategies that will reduce costs for payers and improve outcomes for patients. The potential market opportunity for MSPrecise as a diagnostic for multiple sclerosis is over $200M annually, and could increase to over $1B if it were to be approved as a monitoring tool to measure the efficacy of drug treatment over time. 3. Amarantus Diagnostics' LymPro Test  neuroimmunology-based flow cytometry assay for Alzheimer's disease (AD), offers an early, accurate, and scalable diagnostic result for physicians seeking to provide the best information and treatment plan for patients from the earliest stages of this devastating disease. AD diagnosis is another indication, along with MS, that suffers from a high misdiagnosis rate. AD costs the US healthcare system approximately $200B in direct costs per year, and these costs are expected to exceed $1.2T by 2050. The estimated market opportunity for LymPro is over $100M annually in a CLIA-diagnostic setting, and this opportunity would expand to over $3B if it were to be approved as a generalized screening test for patients at their initial Medicare enrollment visit and monitoring tool for at-risk patients. LymPro is already being made available to the AD research and development community under an Investigational Use Only (IUO) designation via a services agreement between Amarantus and Icon Central Laboratories. ""After exploring numerous avenues for implementing Avant's OvaDx  development and commercialization strategy, it is clear that combining Avant's and Amarantus' diagnostic assets and core competencies forms a platform that provides maximum value to our collective shareholders,"" said Gregg Linn, President & CEO of Avant. ""The collective diagnostic assets will create a truly unique opportunity to implement our respective missions of saving and enhancing lives through early detection of disease in oncology and neurology. The combined companies will enjoy additional benefits by creating a compelling platform to showcase the power diagnostics have to reduce costs and improve outcomes in the healthcare system."" ""We are extremely pleased to have found the appropriate partner with whom to merge our diagnostics business unit,"" said Gerald E. Commissiong, President & CEO of Amarantus. ""We believe that combining these state-of-the-art technologies with a deep understanding of chronic disease rooted in immunology will produce a world-class diversified immuno-oncology and neuroimmunology focused diagnostics company able to deliver actionable information to physicians seeking to provide the most tailored treatment options for patients, while also assisting the research community in developing new medicines for these devastating disorders."" Concurrent with this announcement, Amarantus Diagnostics has entered into an agreement with a Maryland-based CLIA laboratory to house its assays in preparation for CLIA-enabling validation studies. Upon closing of the merger transaction, Avant Diagnostics will take over this agreement and be positioned to complete the development of OvaDx in that CLIA-certified facility.","Published: January 20, 2016"

Under laboratory conditions, iPS cells can be derived from human cells. Such iPS cells can be cultivated in unlimited amounts, and if necessary, they can be made to differentiate into desired cell types, such as heart, liver or nerve cells. Medical research can use induced pluripotent cells in many different ways   for example, to study the mechanisms of disease or in drug screenings   which makes them perfect biobanking material. Such iPS cells can be derived, e.g., from fibroblasts cultivated from a piece of skin, or directly from blood cells. Blood cells are the most useful biobank material, as taking blood samples is a simple process, routinely done in the course of diagnostics and treatment.However, it has thus far been unclear whether iPS cells derived from different cell types are fully comparable, or whether their differentiation process is shaped by the tissue type the cells originally came from. To settle the matter, researchers from the University of Helsinki compared the characteristics of iPS cells derived from skin to those derived from blood using a comprehensive range of analysis methods: in addition to gene expression, they studied DNA methylation as well as the spontaneous and guided differentiation capacity of the stem cells. The researchers focused on determining whether human iPS cells had, as indicated by previous studies, an  epigenetic memory , meaning that a stem cell derived from a blood cell would be easier to turn into a blood cell than a stem cell derived from skin. The results were unambiguous: several different indicators showed that the type of original cell made no difference when the stem cell was fully reprogrammed. Says Professor Timo Otonkoski from the University of Helsinki:  It is obvious that pluripotent stem cells derived from different cell types are fully equal. These results are highly significant to bio banks, as this way one collection can feature different source cells, and previously stored living cell samples remain useful for iPS cell production.  What was surprising was how different the iPS cells derived from different individuals were. The genotype of the donor obviously shapes the differentiation behaviour of the stem cell.  The genetically determined individual differences in stem cell differentiation were surprisingly extensive,  Otonkoski points out.  This means that to make reliable observations about the functional implications of genotypes related to an illness requires that bio banks acquire a sufficiently large variety of samples from several donors.""

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/twoforone-bacterial-virulence-factor-revealed-212561,Two for One Bacterial Virulence Factor Revealed Antivirulence antibiotics could dodge resistance longer than traditional antibiotics  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. We ve all seen the headlines.  Man found to be shedding virulent strain of polio ;  Virulent flu strain in Europe hits the economy ;  Most virulent strain of E. coli ever seen contains DNA sequences from plague bacteria.  To most of us  virulent  means  aggressive,  or just plain  bad,  but to a microbiologist it has a more specific meaning. Virulent strains of bacteria are ones that produce  virulence factors,  small molecules and proteins that convert a benign bacterium into a pathogen. They make the difference between E. coli that are helpful members of our gut microbiome and the E. coli O157:H7 responsible for the Jack-in-the-Box outbreak. Virulence factors allow bacteria to evade the human immune system, to infect tissues and cells and to establish a foothold within the body. Without them, bacteria would be rapidly cleared by the immune system and unable to establish an infection. Tim Wencewicz, PhD, assistant professor of chemistry in Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, thinks we should be looking for agents that block virulence factors rather than continuing to search for ones to kill bacteria outright. In his vision, antivirulence antibiotics would replace failing bactericidal ones.  Do we have to find molecules that kill bacteria to fight bacterial infections,  he asks.  Is that really what we have to do?  Traditional antibiotics carry with them the seeds of their own destruction, he said. The megadoses of broad spectrum antibiotics often given to patients in clinical medicine apply tremendous selective pressure to bacterial communities, creating rich opportunities for resistant strains by eliminating all susceptible ones.  Antivirulence antibiotics would apply much less selective pressure,  Wencewicz said.  If you treat bacteria in a test tube with an antivirulence antibiotic, the bacteria will grow as if there is no antibiotic there. But if you treat bacteria in the human body, bacterial growth will be suppressed. The antivirulence antibiotic behaves like a traditional bacteriostatic antibiotic, suppressing pathogen s growth until the immune system has time to recognize and clear it.  We could give anti-virulence antibiotics to people with healthy immune systems, who would be able to clear infections with this assistance,  he said,  and traditional antibiotics combined with antivirulence therapies to people with compromised immune systems, who really need them.  Wencewicz and third-year chemistry graduate student Justin Shapiro describe one possible drug target: an iron-seeking molecule secreted by the bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii. Now that the complex biochemistry of this virulence factor is better understood, they plan to start looking for agents that block its synthesis or activity. Know your enemy The bacterium Wencewicz studied illustrates how quickly and spectacularly traditional antibiotics can fail. A. baumannii, sometimes called  Iraqibacter,  emerged as a battlefield pathogen during the wars in the Middle East.  People would be injured, go to the hospital with an open wound and get an Actinetobacter infection,  Wencewicz said.  Doctors tried to treat these infections with every drug at their disposal and they found that they were resistant to almost every FDA approved antibiotic. Nothing worked against these infections.  The resistant bacteria soon spread globally and leaked out of hospitals into communities. A. baumannii is a bad pathogen not because of the number of infections it causes  Staphylococcus aureus causes many more   but because its hallmark is multi-drug resistance. A Gram-negative bacterium, it has a double cell wall and so is intrinsically resistant to most classes of antibiotics.  Just the fact that it is Gram-negative tosses off the table many antibiotics that would work against Staph, which is Gram-positive,  Wencewicz said.  So you start with a smaller set of antibiotics, but A. baumannii are often resistant to those as well because they swap resistance genes,  Wencewicz said. A strain that caused an outbreak in China in 2008 carried a  massive  plasmid, or mobile DNA element, that included 45 resistance genes, he said. If a patient has resistant A. baumannii, the standard of care is to drop back to polymixins, compounds developed in the 1950s that were abandoned in the 1950s because they are so toxic to kidneys, he said. Now, strains resistant to polymixins are being found in hospitals.  Given the speed with which pathogens resistant to bactericidal antibiotics took over when we selected for them with broad spectrum antibiotics, we should design the next generation of drugs with bacterial evolution in mind,  he said. Starving them out One class of virulence factors common to many pathogens is siderophores, small molecules whose job is to seek out iron in the environment, wrap around it, and bring it back to the bacterial cell.  When you get an infection, your body s first response is to starve out the invader. You hide all your nutrients: you flush your amino acids into your kidneys, and drain all nutrient supplies in the blood,  Wencewicz said. This is a particularly effective strategy in the case of iron, because iron is in short supply to begin with. The concentration of iron in the blood can be 10-24 molar (one yoctomole or about one atom of iron per 1.6 liters of blood). Living things need about 10-6 molar concentrations of iron (micromoles) to survive, Wencewicz said.  Bacteria have to fight this huge concentration gradient in order to grab enough iron to proliferate,  he said. A. baumannii makes three siderophores which work in concert to create a gradient of iron chelation that feeds the metal back to the bacterial cell. But in this research he focused on acetintobactin, a siderophore found in every single clinical isolate of A. baumannii. A fish pathogen provides a clue The structure of acinetobactin was published in 1994, and, by 2009, scientists had discovered that it was created by the rearrangement (isomerization) of a precursor molecule called pre-acinetobactin. Wencewicz knew that the fish pathogen Vibrio anguillarum makes a similar compound, called pre-anguibactin, but pre-anguibactin is locked in the  pre  form and does not isomerize. So in this case, it seemed, the  pre  form is a functional siderophore. He wondered which of the two forms of acinetobactin was the real siderophore: the pre-acinetobactin, the acinetobactin   or both. He also knew from the literature that A. baumannii could prosper over a wide range of pHs but most sites of infection are acidic. In fact,  A. baumannii can induce lactic acidosis by lowering the pH of its surroundings by converting glucose to lactic acid and secreting the acid. So as a first step his lab measured pre-acinobactin s rate of isomerization over a pH range from 5.5 to 8.0 (roughly from the pH of Pepto Bismol to the pH of baking soda).  We discovered that pre-acinetobacin is stable at a slightly acidic pH of 5, but at the more basic pH of 8, it rapidly isomerizes to acnetobactin,  Wencewicz said. Why is this siderophore pH sensitive?  Suppose A. baumannii has established itself in a slightly acidic open wound,  Wencewicz said,  but depletes the resources there. To gain access to more nutrients it enters the bloodstream, but the pH of blood is 7.4 not 5. When the pH of the bacterium s environment changes, the pre-acinetobactin converts to acinetobactin, which performs better at the new pH.  In short, A. baumannii has evolved a two-for-one siderophore whose conversion from one form to another is triggered by a change in pH. This strategy pays off, Wencewicz said, because siderophores are metabolically expensive to make. If the bacteria can make one convertible molecule, they don t have to build and maintain two separate pathways for two siderophores.  We think this may be a general strategy,  he said,  because there are other classes of siderophores that also isomerize.  Now that we know how this siderophore works, we can properly frame techniques to block it,  he said.  For example, we might attach something bulky to the siderophore so that when it docks on the bacertium s receptor, it plugs it, preventing the siderophore from ferrying the iron inside.  Wencewicz does not underestimate the enormous distance between a potential drug target and a safe and effective clinical drug. But given the rapid evolution of bacteria, he feels we shouldn t be turning over every stone looking for new bactericidal compounds that would be just as brittle as those that have already failed. Instead, we should look for antibiotics that, if not evolution-free, at least apply much less selective pressure on bacterial communities to evolve resistance.","Published: January 20, 2016"

As reported online scientists from Harvard Medical School and Boston Children s Hospital restored vision in mice with optic nerve injury by using gene therapy to get the nerves to regenerate and, in a crucial step, by adding a channel-blocking drug to help the nerves conduct impulses from the eye to the brain. In the future, they believe, the same effect could be achieved with drugs alone. In the study, previously blind mice turned their heads to follow patterns of moving bars after being given the treatment, said co-senior investigators Zhigang He, HMS professor of neurology at Boston Children s, and Michela Fagiolini, HMS assistant professor of neurology at Boston Children s. The technicians doing the tests did not know which mice had been treated.  By making the bars thinner and thinner, we found that the animals could not only see, but they improved significantly in how well they could see,  said Fagiolini. Other teams, including one at Boston Children s, have restored partial vision in mice, but they relied on genetic techniques that can be done only in a lab. Generally, their methods involved deleting or blocking tumor suppressor genes, which encourages regeneration but could also promote cancer. The new study is the first to restore vision with an approach that could realistically be used in the clinic and that does not interfere with tumor suppressor genes. Getting nerves to conduct The key advance in restoring vision was getting the regenerated nerve fibers, or axons, to form working connections with brain cells and also to carry impulses all the way from the eye to the brain. The challenge was that the fibers regrow without the insulating sheath known as myelin, which helps propagate nerve signals over long distances.  We found that the regenerated axons are not myelinated and have very poor conduction; the travel speed is not high enough to support vision,  said He.  We needed some way to overcome this issue.  Turning to the medical literature, they learned that a potassium channel blocker, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), helps strengthen nerve signals when myelin is absent. The drug is marketed as AMPYRA for multiple sclerosis, which also involves a loss of myelin. When they added 4-AP, the signals were able to go the distance. New paradigm The study used a gene therapy virus called AAV to deliver the growth factors that trigger regeneration (osteopontin, insulin-like growth factor 1 and ciliary neurotrophic factor). Now, He and Fagiolini are testing whether injecting a cocktail of growth factor proteins directly into the eye could be equally effective.  We re trying to better understand the mechanisms and how often the proteins would have to be injected,  said He.  The gene therapy virus we used is approved for clinical study in eye disease, but a medication would be even better.  With regeneration kick-started, 4-AP or a similar drug could then be given systemically to maintain nerve conduction. Because 4-AP has potential side effects including seizures if given chronically, He and Fagiolini have begun testing derivatives, not yet FDA-approved, that are potentially safer for long-term use. The researchers are further testing the mice to better understand the extent of visual recovery and whether their approach might get myelin to regrow over time.  The drugs might need to be paired with visual training to facilitate recovery,  said Fagiolini,  but now we have a paradigm to push forward.  Fengfeng Bei, HMS instructor in neurology, and Hing Cheong (Henry) Lee, HMS research fellow in neurology, who along with He and Fagiolini are members of the F.M. Kirby Neurobiology Center at Boston Children s, were co-first authors on the paper.","Published: January 20, 2016"

VLPs resemble viruses, but importantly don't carry pathogenic genetic material and thus cannot cause disease. These particles are engineered to display one part of a pathogen to the immune system, which can elicit strong protection upon any subsequent exposure to that pathogen. Karl Brune, leading the work in Professor Mark Howarth's lab in Oxford s Department of Biochemistry explained: 'Current techniques to develop VLP-based vaccines take time and do not always work. Whilst getting the pathogen parts to stick to the carrier VLP, often problems such as misassembly or misfolding arise that make the vaccine ineffective at generating protective immunity.' This failure rate translates into high development costs in trying to create vaccines against major diseases such as malaria, HIV and cancer. 'A more reliable way of assembling candidate vaccines could make them much cheaper and improve the chances of vaccines against these illnesses. A faster way of assembling vaccines may also help with the rapid development of new vaccines against unforeseen disease outbreaks.', says Dr Darren Leneghan, leading the immunisation work with Dr Sumi Biswas and Professor Simon Draper in Oxford's Jenner Institute, which specialises in vaccine development. Karl Brune s work has now overcome this key challenge in vaccine assembly using the lab's 'bacterial superglue'. This glue is made of two parts, a larger protein called SpyCatcher and a smaller protein part named SpyTag, both engineered from the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. When SpyTag and SpyCatcher meet, they form an unbreakable bond. The team succeeded in biologically encoding SpyCatcher on VLPs, which now enables scientists and engineers easily and relatively quickly to glue proteins with the small SpyTag to the SpyCatcher-VLPs. Karl Brune said:  We tested the SpyCatcher-VLP   SpyTag-antigen combination using a range of malarial and cancer-relevant antigens. This showed that linking can be done simply and quickly to produce stable vaccines that generated robust antibody responses. 'We need to do more research, both to see if we can use Tag/Catcher fusion with other diseases and to test effectiveness in live rather than lab conditions.' The team say that their technique should speed up developing new vaccines and also may help other medical applications of nanoparticles.","Published: January 20, 2016"

Coli and Staphylococcus infect some 2 million people and kill at least 23,000 people in the United States each year. Efforts to thwart these so-called  superbugs  have consistently fallen short due to the bacteria s ability to rapidly adapt and develop immunity to common antibiotics such as penicillin.   New research from CU-Boulder, however, suggests that the solution to this big global problem might be to think small very small. In recently published findings researchers at the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering and the BioFrontiers Institute describe new light-activated therapeutic nanoparticles known as  quantum dots.  The dots, which are about 20,000 times smaller than a human hair and resemble the tiny semiconductors used in consumer electronics, successfully killed 92 percent of drug-resistant bacterial cells in a lab-grown culture.   By shrinking these semiconductors down to the nanoscale, we re able to create highly specific interactions within the cellular environment that only target the infection,  said Prashant Nagpal, an assistant professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at CU-Boulder and a senior author of the study. Previous research has shown that metal nanoparticles created from gold and silver, among other metals can be effective at combating antibiotic resistant infections, but can indiscriminately damage surrounding cells as well.  The quantum dots, however, can be tailored to particular infections thanks to their light-activated properties. The dots remain inactive in darkness, but can be activated on command by exposing them to light, allowing researchers to modify the wavelength in order to alter and kill the infected cells.  While we can always count on these superbugs to adapt and fight the therapy, we can quickly tailor these quantum dots to come up with a new therapy and therefore fight back faster in this evolutionary race,  said Nagpal. The specificity of this innovation may help reduce or eliminate the potential side effects of other treatment methods, as well as provide a path forward for future development and clinical trials.  Antibiotics are not just a baseline treatment for bacterial infections, but HIV and cancer as well,  said Anushree Chatterjee, an assistant professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at CU-Boulder and a senior author of the study.  Failure to develop effective treatments for drug-resistant strains is not an option, and that s what this technology moves closer to solving.  Nagpal and Chatterjee are the co-founders of PRAAN Biosciences, Inc., a Boulder, Colorado-based startup that can sequence genetic profiles using just a single molecule, technology that may aid in the diagnosis and treatment of superbug strains. The authors have filed a patent on the new quantum dot technology.

These act like a checklist for healthcare professionals performing an ultrasound scan of the tumour. They highlight ten features   such as size of the growth or whether it has smooth or rough edges   and classify it into one of three categories: cancerous, non-cancerous (benign) or inconclusive.  This helps medics decide whether or not to operate.  The team behind the current study wanted to see if the Simple Rules system could be made more detailed   and identify the percentage cancer risk for each individual patient. They also wanted to reduce the number of tumours dubbed inconclusive.  After analysing the tumours of over 4,500 women over the course of ten years, the team created a mathematical model that weights each of the features in the Simple Rules, and calculates the risk of a tumour being cancerous.  The study found the model predicted cancer risk with 98 per cent accuracy. The system maintained its accuracy even without using results from the blood test currently used to help diagnose the condition, called CA125. Professor Tom Bourne, one of the senior authors on the study, from the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial said:  This system enables us to accurately calculate a cancer risk for each individual patient with ovarian growths, before they undergo surgery. Using this information we can then discuss with patients the best course of treatment.  Crucially, providing an accurate cancer risk from an ultrasound scan may enable patients with a high cancer risk to see a specialist   and see them sooner. Some estimates suggest less than half of women with ovarian cancer in the UK are operated on by a specialist gynaecological cancer surgeon, despite the outcome being significantly better for women when this happens. If we can get the right women to the right surgeon we can improve outcomes for women with this disease. On the other hand we can also avoid women with benign cysts having surgery they may not need.  The authors argue that the Simple Rules system is more accurate than the current system also in use in the UK, called the Risk of Malignancy Index, and hope it will be adopted more widely.","Published: January 20, 2016"

Albion will manage and administer the Fund in partnership with UCL s technology transfer company UCL Business ( UCLB ), with whom it has a long-standing relationship including co-investment. Albion has worked closely with UCLB to devise an innovative structure for the Fund, which will support high quality research projects with significant commercial potential. The Fund is different from most venture funds in a number of ways, designed to be optimal for the commercialization of intellectual property (IP): first, it will be able to invest at a very early stage by providing proof-of-concept funding to a number of projects but still be able to follow through to full commercial development, enhanced by its ability to draw on significant further potential co-investment funds; second, it has the flexibility of pursuing either a capital-efficient licensing route towards commercialization, or the creation of spin-out companies; third, the Fund is less restricted by specific exit timeframes so can remain invested for as long as required to achieve the best outcome for each opportunity. Lastly, the unique partnership approach with UCLB creates a strong combination of commercialization and investment skills and capabilities. This approach leverages Albion s deep experience in supporting high growth companies through to later stage venture investment and eventual exit. The Fund is cornerstoned by experienced venture investors, the European Investment Fund (EIF) and Imperial Innovations, together with contributions from Albion and UCLB. The Fund will support ideas from all of UCL s academic areas but will have a strong focus on the physical and life science sectors. Investment decisions will be made by an independent investment committee, led by Albion. Given the quality and quantity of UCL s research output, it is expected that the Fund will make its first investments within the first three months and complete its initial rounds over five years. The Fund will look to work closely with other significant funders of IP commercialization, to help to take an optimized and long-term approach. Patrick Reeve, Managing Partner at Albion Ventures said:  The UCL Technology Fund represents a significant milestone in commercializing university research output, which is playing an increasingly important role in stimulating wider economic growth. UCL has an outstanding track record in developing innovative research ideas and thanks to this new Fund, we are excited by the prospect of being able to see many of these reach their full commercial potential. The development of this Fund demonstrates the full breadth of Albion s capabilities in venture investing and we look forward to achieving further breakthroughs in the years ahead that will have a positive impact on wider society.  Dr Andrew Elder, Partner at Albion Ventures said:  The UCL Technology Fund breaks new ground in IP investing through its long-term partnership approach that enables high quality research ideas to be taken from proof-of-concept stage through multiple funding rounds to a successful exit with the most appropriate level of capital and capital-efficiency. This approach, which has been co-developed through our strong relationship with UCLB, is made possible through the combined extensive experience of Albion in growing companies and successful investing coupled with UCLB s experience in commercializing university IP. The innovative partnership will ensure that UCL s academics will have the best support possible to enable their ideas to be successfully commercialized.  UCL is ranked number one for its research strength in the UK s recent Research Excellence Framework and has a long track record of developing thriving businesses through UCLB.","Published: January 20, 2016"

Tsukasa Uchida and collaborators at Kyoto University have identified proteins associated with cancer suppression and prevention of hypoxia as key players in the progression of ALS. One of the main factors triggering the onset of ALS is the malfunctioning of nerve support cells called oligodendrocytes. Recent studies have implied that the misfolding and accumulation of the protein TDP-43 in oligodendrocytes was likely linked to the development of ALS, as with other neurological diseases like Alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's. The current research takes this a step further, explaining how this protein ends up accelerating ALS' characteristic decline in muscle strength. Uchida's team found that the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein associated with a gene most notable for cancer suppression strongly binds to malformed versions of TDP-43 in oligodendrocytes. ""TDP-43 appears to be a very fragile protein, and becomes fragmented in the cytoplasm. When this happens it binds to VHL, which is typically only found in blood vessels, but surprisingly enough, we also found them in oligodendrocytes,"" explains Uchida. VHL forms a complex with cullin 2 (CUL2), a protein that rescues the cell in hypoxic conditions, then facilitating the breakdown of malformed TDP-43 even under normal conditions. ""CUL2 was known to break down other proteins, but again, our study reports for the first time that it's also involved in the breakdown of TDP-43,"" says Uchida. Additionally, the team found that when VHL becomes overly abundant, VHL/TDP-43 complex accumulates in the cytoplasm, forming a protein cluster thought to be detrimental to the functioning of oligodendrocytes. ""VHL overload in the cytoplasm and the imbalance between VHL and CUL2 seems to be the root cause of oligodendrocyte dysfunction,"" says Makoto Urushitani, a senior author of the study. ""Once we have a clearer idea of how the VHL and CUL2 balance is maintained, I believe we'll be able to make a huge contribution to the treatment of ALS."" Kyoto University  press release Uchida T et al. CUL2-mediated clearance of misfolded TDP-43 is paradoxically affected by VHL in oligodendrocytes in ALS.

Botulism is a serious form of food poisoning, caused by a deadly neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The neurotoxin is so poisonous that eating even the tiniest amount of food in which C. botulinum has germinated, grown and formed neurotoxin can result in severe illness and death. Because of this, the food industry uses high quality raw materials and good hygienic manufacturing practice along with a strict set of safety criteria when producing foods. The safety criteria include precisely defined cooking conditions and times, as well as controlled storage temperatures and use by dates that keep our food safe. The rare outbreaks of foodborne botulism have occurred when these criteria haven t been followed correctly. Although these criteria are well established, consumer demand for reduced preservatives, milder heat processing and longer shelf lives is driving continuous innovation in minimally processed chilled foods, which include ready meals and similar prepared items. But delivering this needs a full understanding of how these changes affect the germination and growth of food poisoning bacteria, especially C. botulinum. Professor Mike Peck and Dr Gary Barker from IFR s Gut Health and Food Safety Programme have played a key part in a very successful research project called SUSSLE (Sustainable Shelf Life Extension (SUSSLE). IFR collaborated with the Chilled Food Association and Unilever Research to enhance the sustainability of minimally processed chilled foods by using quantitative risk assessment to set a safe shelf life with respect to C. botulinum, and reduce energy usage for minimally processed chilled foods. The SUSSLE project was co-funded by the food industry, Defra and BBSRC. To quantify the risks it was necessary to generate new information about how many C. botulinum spores are in raw food before processing. Spores of C. botulinum are present in lots of different environments, but only become dangerous when they germinate and produce their deadly toxin. Minimising this risk starts with an assessment of the initial spore load in food. A protocol developed by Prof. Peck and his team is considered a very sensitive enumeration method for spores in food materials, able to detect as few as 10-100 spores per kilogram. However, the actual level of contamination with spores is usually lower than this, and just one spore could be enough to germinate and cause botulism. To overcome the problem of measuring spore loads that are close to the limit of detection, the researchers combined information from hundreds of historical studies with dedicated experimental and statistical approaches to quantify typical spore loads for different food types. The researchers reviewed over 700 studies to get an estimate of spore concentrations in different food types, as well as the variability and uncertainty associated with these. These data were then combined with experimental results taken from sampling almost 500 raw foods, prior to any treatment that would reduce the spore load. This information is combined with results from controlled experiments that established the detection limit for spores in the different types of raw food. Together this gives a statistical framework to provide unbiased estimates of the spore loads, based on statistical uncertainty and targeted evidence collection. Most of the tests were negative, which is significant information to feed into the model. In conjunction with the finding that for many foods it was possible to detect just a few spores of C. botulinum, the research also provides an appreciation of the value of the information set and potential conflicts within the data.  The evidence shows that for many raw food materials, typical spore loads are smaller than previously reported  said Professor Peck.  This makes a big difference to how we make decisions about food safety and risk assessment.  These findings can be used to improve active surveillance of foods, by showing how resources could be best used in this area. For meat, fish, shellfish and fungi, additional control experiments involving expected spore loads are most valuable, but for other foods testing additional samples is more effective. In particular, additional tests for spores in herbs and spices would be most beneficial. Through the SUSSLE project products are now on supermarket shelves that have been produced with lower energy inputs, with safe extended shelf lives, and improved consumer acceptability.","Published: January 19, 2016"

Lead author, Dr Stefan Howorka (UCL Chemistry), said:  Natural biological pores made of proteins are essential for transporting cargo into and out of biological cells but they are hard to design from scratch. DNA offers a whole new strategy for constructing highly specific synthetic pores that we can open and close on demand. We ve engineered our pores to act like doors   the door unlocks only when provided with the right key. By building these pores into drug carriers, we think it will allow for much more precise targeting of therapeutics.  Many therapeutics including anti-cancer drugs can be ferried around the body in tiny carriers called vesicles which are targeted to different tissues using biological markers. Previously, releasing the drugs from inside the vesicles was triggered with temperature-induced leaky vesicle walls or with inserted peptide channels, which are less rigid and predictable than DNA. Using DNA building blocks, the team designed pores with pre-determined structures and defined properties which were precisely anchored into the walls   or membranes   of vesicles.  Our pores take the shape of an open barrel made of six DNA staves. We designed a molecular gate to close off one entrance but then re-open the channel when a specific molecule binds. Anchors with high membrane affinity were attached to tether the water-soluble pores into the oily membrane,  explained first author, Dr Jonathan Burns (UCL Chemistry). Using electrophysiology techniques, the researchers verified that the pore vertically spanned the surface of the membrane and was stable with an internal width of 2 nm, which is an appropriate size for small drugs molecules to fit through. The gate s lock and release mechanism was then tested with electrophysiology techniques as well as with fluorophores, which are of equivalent size to small molecules. As the DNA pore had a net negative charge, fluorophores with a net negative charge moved through with more ease than those with a net positive charge, showing selectivity for which cargo could exit. Removing the lock with a matching key increased of traffic 140-fold compared to a mismatched key. Co-author Astrid Seifert who works with Dr Niels Fertig at Nanion Technologies, said:  We were able to precisely analyse the performance of each of the pores we created. We first inserted pores in membranes and then tested the biophysical response of each channel using advanced microchips. We ve not only developed a new way to design highly specific pores but also an automated method to test their properties in situ, which will be important for testing pores being used for targeted drug delivery in the future.  The researchers plan on testing the synthetic pores in a variety of scenarios including the release of anti-cancer drugs to cells and the development of pores that release pharmaceutically active biomolecules. Dr Howorka added,  Our approach is a big step forward in building and using synthetic biological structures and promises a new era in pore design and synthetic biology. We have demonstrated such precise control over the behaviour of the pore, both in terms of selectivity and in terms of responsiveness that we believe that the method paves the way for a wide range of applications from drug delivery to nanosensing.

Instead, they leave behind their fingerprints in the form of cell-free DNA. In people, these tiny fragments of DNA can be found in the bloodstream.  In recent years, research into cell-free DNA has led to a type of test, dubbed the ""liquid biopsy,"" that can diagnose and monitor some cancers, identify fetal abnormalities, and assess the health of transplanted organs, all with a simple blood draw. Despite the promise of these tests, at present the range of conditions they can detect is limited.  In a new study, UW Medicine researchers in Seattle show that it might be possible to overcome these limitations with a method for identifying what types of cells gave rise to the cell-free DNA.  This method could potentially expand the scope of the liquid biopsy. The new approach relies on analyzing the fragmentation patterns seen in the cell-free DNA in one individual, and comparing that pattern to what might be expected for cell death associated with various medical or physiological conditions.  The research was led by Matthew W. Snyder, a graduate student, and Dr. Martin Kircher, a postdoctoral fellow, in the laboratory of Dr. Jay Shendure, University of Washington professor of genome sciences and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.  Their results are reported this week in the scientific journal Cell. Their paper is titled, ""Cell-free DNA comprises an in vivo nucleosome footprint that informs its tissues-of-origin."" ""Our findings suggest it is possible to identify tissues contributing to cell-free DNA by looking at these fragmentation patterns, instead of looking for specific mutations in the DNA,"" Shendure said. The test examines the ends of each fragment of DNA, and tries to identify hotspots, or parts of the DNA that get cut more frequently than others.  To fit into a cell's nucleus, DNA has to be coiled, wound and folded into an incredibly compact package. Key to this process are structures called nucleosomes, which are composed of a protein core around which the DNA is wrapped like thread around a spool. Nucleosomes are strung out along the entire length of the genome, like beads on a string, with the DNA looping around one nucleosome after the next. Each cell type in the body packages DNA slightly differently. These differences leave their tell-tale mark in the resulting cell-free DNA.  The UW researchers hypothesized that they could use these fingerprints to work backwards to try to figure out where the cell-free DNA originated. To do this, they first needed to know which parts of the DNA were wrapped around the nucleosomes.  During cell death, the DNA gets chopped into small pieces by enzymes that like to cut in the easily accessible, unprotected sections of DNA in between the nucleosomes. Research has pointed to 13 million positions in the human genome where nucleosomes are most likely to be located.  Using blood samples from cancer patients, the researchers showed that different types of cancer left different nucleosome fingerprints in the cell-free DNA. For some of the cancers, the researchers could identify the anatomical source of the tumor. ""This could be particularly relevant in the 5 percent of metastatic cancers whose original source is unknown,"" Shendure said, adding that the test ""could aid in diagnosing what kind of cancer it is and to help guide treatment."" Most liquid biopsy approaches look for specific DNA mismatches between different cells in the body, such as the mutations found in tumor cells but not healthy cells. The researchers think that the advantage of the new test is that it may work even when the cells are genetically identical to one another. The approach potentially could be used to diagnose a wide variety of conditions that kill off cells, but that as yet cannot be diagnosed with liquid biopsies. Examples of such serious, cell-destroying medical problems are heart attacks, strokes and autoimmune diseases.","Published: January 19, 2016"

Scientists have come to understand much about how stem cells function when we are adults, but less is known about where these stem cells come from to begin with, as an embryo is developing. Now, researchers at The Rockefeller University have identified a new mechanism by which cells are instructed during development to become stem cells. The results help explain how communication between cells mediates this process, and may have implications for skin cancer treatments. Stem cell debut: The researchers traced the cell divisions that occur as hair follicles form in mice to determine where stem cells first emerge. Above, developing hair follicles are shown at various stages.  While adult stem cells are increasingly well-characterized, we know little about their origins. Here, we show that in the skin, stem cell progenitors of the hair follicle are specified as soon as the cells within the single-layered embryonic epidermis begin to divide downward to form an embryonic hair bud,  explains Elaine Fuchs, Rebecca C. Lancefield Professor and head of the Robin Chemers Neustein Laboratory of Mammalian Cell Biology and Development.  This timing was much earlier than previously thought, and gives us new insights into the establishment of these very special cells.  Which came first, the stem cell or the niche? Clusters of stem cells receive signals from other nearby cells that instruct them to either stay a stem cell or differentiate into a specific cell type. These instructive groups of cells, called the  niche,  are known to maintain adult stem cell populations. Less well understood is how the niche forms, or when and where stem cells first appear during embryonic development.  Adult stem cells are dependent on the niche for instructions on both how to become a stem cell, and how to control stem cell population size,  says first author Tamara Ouspenskaia.  The question was, does the niche appear first and call other cells over to become stem cells? Or is it the other way around? Stem cells could be appearing elsewhere first and then recruiting the niche.  Working in the mouse hair follicle, a region that contains active stem cells, Fuchs and colleagues investigated the cell divisions that occur as a hair follicle is first forming. The hair follicle begins as a small bud called a placode, and develops into a tissue of multiple layers, comprised of different cell types. By labeling cells within the placode and tracing their progeny, the researchers determined that from each division, one daughter cell stayed put, while the other escaped to a different layer. Further experiments revealed that this escapee becomes a stem cell. This finding is significant, as it s the earliest point in development that stem cells have been detected in this system, and it indicates that stem cells may exist before the niche is formed. Flying the nest to become a stem cell How cells become the cell type they re destined to be a liver cell or skin cell, for example depends on a number of factors, including molecular signals from other cells that help turn specific genes on or off. Fuchs and colleagues observed that the signaling activity was different between the two daughter cells that ended up in different locations, and aimed to characterize how signaling helped seal their ultimate cell fate. They found that the environment to which the escapee cell daughter moved had low levels of WNT signaling, known to play a role in embryonic development. In contrast, WNT signaling was high in the environment where the other daughter remained. The level of WNT affected how the cells responded to another signal known as SHH (Sonic Hedgehog) only those in the low-WNT environment responded to SHH signaling, which instructed the cells to become stem cells.  These cells must leave home, they must leave the environment with high WNT signaling, to become stem cells,  says Ouspenskaia.  We observed that SHH, which actually comes from the cells with high WNT signaling, is essential in helping the cells leave. So in order for this escapee cell to become a stem cell, it needs to receive an SHH signal from its sister cell at home telling it  you re the stem cell.  The researchers believe that antagonism between WNT and SHH signaling may help to control the number of stem cells produced during this time of embryo development.  This newly identified signaling cross talk provides insights into why these two signals have such a profound impact on skin cancers, where the numbers of cancerous tissue-propagating stem cells are excessive,  says Fuchs, who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.  This work now paves the way for future research into the fascinating and clinically important relation between tumor-propagating and normal stem cells. ","Published: January 19, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/versatile-new-moleculebuilding-technique-213584,Versatile New Molecule Building Technique Chemists at The Scripps Research Institute  TSRI  have devised a new and widely applicable technique for building potential drug molecules and other organic compounds  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The new method enables researchers to add clusters of atoms called carbon fragment or functional groups to certain organic molecules more efficiently, robustly and selectively than current methods typically allow. It thus opens up new possibilities for chemists to assemble novel compounds that can be tested for useful properties in the development of drugs and other products.  We demonstrated this technique with two broad classes of compounds, aldehydes and ketones the  bread and butter  of modern chemical synthesis,  said senior investigator Jin-Quan Yu, the Frank and Bertha Hupp Professor of Chemistry at TSRI. Expanding the Toolkit Yu s laboratory specializes in the development of techniques to make molecule-building easier, particularly for chemists trying to devise potential new drugs. Yu and his team have published more than a half-dozen of these innovations in Science or Nature in the past two years alone. Their newest tool improves a basic molecule-building operation called C-H functionalization. When chemists set out to build a candidate drug molecule, they often start with a simple organic compound whose central structure contains more inert carbon hydrogen bonds than reactive carbon heteroatom bonds. Turning such a starter molecule into a useful drug typically means replacing at least one of the hydrogen atoms with a more complex cluster of atoms called a functional group. This C-H functionalization process can be tricky for a variety of reasons, and chemists often have to employ special methods to make it work. Many of these methods involve helper molecules known as  directing groups.  Chemists first attach a directing group to the initial molecule they want to modify; the directing group then guides a bond-breaking catalyst, often a metal such as palladium, to the carbon-hydrogen bond that needs to be broken to make way for the new functional group.  This has proven to be a very reliable and broadly useful strategy,  said Yu,  but it requires at least two additional steps the installation of the directing group and later its removal and sometimes the directing group is incompatible with functional groups already present on the starting molecule.  Ideally, chemists would like to find directing groups that are broadly tolerant of existing functional groups and that also don t have to be attached and detached in separate steps. Essentially that is what Yu and his team have achieved here. Cutting Out Two Steps The team including co-first authors Fang-Lin Zhang, a visiting scholar from Wuhan University of Technology; Kai Hong, a postdoctoral research associate in the Yu Laboratory; and Tuan-Jie Li, a visiting scholar from Jiangsu Normal University found that amino acid molecules (the building blocks of the proteins that help make up all known life forms) can work well as  transient directing groups  for ketone or aldehyde compounds. The amino acids attach themselves automatically to these starter compounds and remove themselves automatically after the new functional group is attached. In effect, this means that they work  catalytically,  functionalizing one starter molecule after another and continually being re-used, rather than being consumed in their first reaction. This further streamlines the process and reduces the overall quantity of reagents that are needed.  In principle, all amino acids can be used as catalytic directing groups for such reactions,  said Yu.  The availability of diverse amino acids makes it possible to find different reagents to suit different substrates or transformations.  A further advantage of the new technique is that it can, with the proper choice of chiral amino acid directing group, preferentially generate  chiral  molecules that are functionalized just on one side. C-H functionalization reactions typically generate a roughly even mix of molecules functionalized on one side plus mirror-image molecules functionalized on the other side yet the desirable biological activity of a drug often comes exclusively from its  right-handed  or  left-handed  chiral form.  The fact that we can do this using a simple amino acid as the directing group and ligand is phenomenal, considering the usual difficulty of such reactions,  said Hong.  Essentially with this new method we re improving functionalizations by cutting out two steps in the functionalization process by using a directing group that is catalytic, and by employing, if needed, a chiral directing group to generate chirally pure compounds,  said Yu.","Published: January 19, 2016"

Many of these infections are not only life-threatening, but caused by rare organisms that are extremely difficult to isolate and identify. However, the sooner an infection is pinned down, the faster and more effectively it can be treated.  In a recently published study the group of Penn colleagues, led by Erle Robertson, PhD, professor and vice-chair  for research in Otorhinolaryngology at the Perelman School of Medicine, and James Alwine, PhD, a professor of Cancer Biology and Michael Feldman, MD, a professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, used a version of the PathoChip microarray, which contains 60,000 probes for all known viruses, as well as a broad range of bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and helminthes, a parasitic worm, to identify the pathogenic agent in the sample of a patient. They analyzed preserved tissue samples from a middle-aged male with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who developed an unknown fungal infection following chemotherapy.  We've run many tests to see if we could identify pathogens in the lab, just to see if the PathoChip has efficacy in identifying a variety of organisms, and we were able to identify all infectious agents tested,  Robertson said.  But this was the first time we actually looked directly at a patient sample to identify a pathogenic agent.  The PathoChip allows for a single sample to be tested simultaneously for thousands of possibilities, dramatically reducing the time required for diagnosis. They first screened the sample and analyzed it with a type of bioinformatics probe to narrow the focus to a specific microbial family. Seventeen organisms displaying the highest signal were compared with the signals from a control sample. Molecular signals obtained from additional bioinformatics tests provided further information, which led to the identification of the specific infectious agent-- in this case one of the two species of Rhizomucor, a rare fungus known to cause zygomycosis in humans. A potentially fatal illness most often seen in immunocompromised patients, zygomycosis is not only difficult to treat but challenging to diagnose. Fungal species can be painfully slow or even impossible to culture in the laboratory, delaying or preventing their identification and therefore patient treatment. As Robertson explains, the PathoChip provides an efficient alternative.  With this technology, out of 60,000 possibilities and probes that we used, in a little over 24 hours we were able to identify this particular fungi,"" he says.  While other techniques, such as sequencing arrays, are available to identify unknown infectious organisms, these approaches can also have significant limitations.  You could use other technologies such as next-generation sequencing, but there would have to be a high percentage of nucleic acids present in the tissue, and technicians would need enough of these materials to do the sequencing,  Robertson explains.  The analysis component of it would take more time,  he adds.  We think this technology is complementary to next-generation sequencing in some ways, and even more finely tuned, because we have a much higher sensitivity in detecting agents or individual organisms present in any kind of sample, whether it's abiotic or biotic. We can identify agents in soil, for example, in plant tissue, in animal tissue, or human tissue. ","Published: January 19, 2016"

Of these, approximately 1,500 people will be selected to take part in EPAD s proof of concept adaptive trials of innovative drugs. Rodrigo Barnes, Chief Technology Officer at Aridhia, said that AnalytiXagility has been chosen because it offers a strong collaborative platform that is accessible to all of the consortium partners and is able to carry out advanced data analytics that can interrogate any kind of data.  AnalytiXagility offers EPAD a flexible working environment that is collaborative, neutral and has the ability to carry out advanced data analytics during complex trials.  It will be used as part of a trial engine for the EPAD cohort of 6,000 subjects and the further 1,500 participants who will be asked to take part in the project s proof of concept adaptive trials of drug candidates or drug combinations that have been specially designed to prevent Alzheimer s dementia.  With no cure for Alzheimer s and little in the way of treatment, it is vital that we understand and learn how to prevent Alzheimer s dementia when in its early phases.  The University of Edinburgh is working with Aridhia to trial the EPAD cohort. Professor Craig Ritchie, one of the project s co-ordinators who is based at the University said:  EPAD is a game-changing project. There is commitment from a wide range of organisations across academia, pharma and public health, to get to the root causes of dementia, to understand how the disease develops over the decades before symptoms become visible, and treat patients at an early stage.   The EPAD model gives us the opportunity to work together to understand who is more likely the get the disease and how they can be treated early, and effectively.  EPAD promises to deliver a more efficient research model which can streamline the recruitment of patients and enable likely drug candidates to be accelerated straight into Phase III trials, the last stage before a new drug is licenced for use. Furthermore, all data collected from the cohort will be made public to allow researchers the chance to improve their understanding of the disease, especially in pre-symptomatic phases. Aridhia s involvement in EPAD cements its commitment to globally significant collaborative research projects, and to addressing one of society s most challenging diseases. Earlier this year the company announced that AnalytiXagility has been chosen to underpin the three year Moneta Research project, supporting their research into identifying people most likely to develop Alzheimer s dementia.","Published: January 19, 2016"

Before the 1800s, purple dye came at a premium, so it was usually restricted to royalty   hence the connection between royals and purple. The 19th century saw the discovery of several synthetic purple dyes, making purple textiles more affordable and readily available. Understanding where these dyes came from and were used is therefore of historical interest. In the new study, researchers from CSIRO Manufacturing and the National Gallery of Victoria in Australia show that the new purple dyes were part of a fast-moving industry, going from first synthesis to commercial use in as few as four years. This reflects how dynamic the fashion industry must have been at the time.  Chemical analysis has given us a glimpse into the state of the dye industry in the 19th century, revealing the actual use of dyes around the world,  said Dr. Jeffrey Church, one of the authors of the study and principal research scientist at CSIRO Manufacturing. The researchers took small samples of fibers from four dresses: three 19th century English dresses and one Australian wedding gown. They extracted the dyes from very small silk yarn samples and analyzed them using a combination of chemical techniques: thin layer chromatography and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. They found that the three English dresses were dyed using methyl violet; one of them was made only four years after the dye was first synthesized.  The dress containing methyl violet was made shortly after the initial synthesis of the dye, indicating the rapidity with which the new synthetic dyes were embraced by the textile dye trade and the fashion world of the day,  commented Dr. Church. However, the Australian wedding dress incorporated the use of a different dye   Perkin s mauve   which was very historically significant, as it was the first synthetic purple dye and was only produced for 10 years. This was a surprise to the researchers, as the dress was made 20 years after the dye had been replaced on the market.  The dress in question was made in Australia,  explained Dr. Church.  Does the presence of Perkin s mauve relate to trade delays between Europe and Australia? Or was this precious fabric woven decades earlier and kept for the special purpose of a wedding? This is an excellent example of how state-of-the-art science and technology can shed light on the lives and times of previous generations. In doing so, as is common in science, one often raises more questions.  Article details The purple coloration of four late 19th century silk dresses: A spectroscopic investigation  by Andrea L.

Porvair Filtration Group   a manufacturer of sintered porous Vyon  and BioVyon  plastic materials   is now able to manufacture large area discs and shapes thanks to the addition to its Wrexham facilities. The company is also opening up its new contract cutting capability for other non-porous plastics materials, saving time, reducing errors and minimizing waste. Porvair, honoured last year with the Queen s Award for Enterprise in International Trade, has invested more than  100,000 in its new cutting technology and environmental controlled area. Its precision cutting technology operates in a new temperature-controlled environment within +/-10C to ensure exact specifications are met, this is crucial for applications such as the manufacture of process chromatography support discs. Achieving tight tolerances on large areas is challenging because changes in temperature will shrink or expand the material, so strict controls are essential. Porvair s new capability enables cutting of plastics sheets of up to a length of three metres by a width of two metres and 25.4mm thickness to be cut to a tolerance of +/-0.4mm and at a controlled temperature tolerance of +/-10C. Customers often define the temperature at which the component needs to be measured, and Porvair is keen to meet their ever-growing expectations while driving defining improvements across the industry. Process chromatography columns are used by the pharmaceutical industry for the large-scale purification of drugs such as insulin or therapeutic antibodies. The columns can have a diameter from 40mm up to two metres and use porous discs, known as bed supports, at the top and bottom of the column to contain and support it. Porvair s General Manager, Roy Rigby said:  We are always working hard to realize industry-leading innovation, and this new cutting capability is already key to delivering large area disc applications for our sintered porous Vyon  and BioVyon  plastics.  We believe that the ability to cut plastic large area shapes to very tight tolerances under controlled temperatures is a significant requirement across many industries. We re therefore pleased to be able to offer it to customers and open up the capability to contracting cutting after investing in its wide benefits   benefits that we are certain they will share in.

Edwina Hart, the Minister for Economy, Science and Transport for the Welsh Government, visited the site to mark the beginning of the construction of the centre which is expected to be operational by 2017. The centre will be situated at the Celtic Springs Business Park in Newport. Proton Partners also plan to build centres in Northumberland and London and each centre will be able to treat up to 700 patients annually. The investment by Proton Partners International   which is headquartered in Wales - was supported by the Wales Life Science Investment Fund established by the Welsh Government and managed by Arthurian Life Sciences. Edwina Hart said:  This is certainly an important milestone in what is a significant investment by Proton Partners to transform cancer care in the UK. It is also a significant investment in Wales and I am delighted support from our Life Sciences Fund played a key role in establishing the business in Wales and ensured their first international centre of excellence and associated UK training centre is being established in Newport.  From an economic perspective it will raise the profile of Wales as a world class centre for life sciences, place Wales firmly at the forefront of innovative developments within the sector and create long term economic benefits.  Mike Moran, Chief Executive of Proton Partners International, said:  Today marks an important step in our plans to improve cancer care in the UK and I am proud that Wales is leading the way.  Our centres will offer proton beam therapy, imaging, radiotherapy and chemotherapy   delivering a fully comprehensive level of cancer care, tailored to fit the different needs of each patient. Later this year in our Newport centre we will be able to start treating patients with traditional radiotherapy, and proton beam therapy will be available in 2017.  Our overall aim is not just to provide cutting-edge treatment, but we also hope to herald a new era of cancer provision and drive improvements in cancer care in the UK.  Lloyd R Evans, survivor of proton beam therapy, said:  For me, proton beam therapy has been a complete success. Due to the nature of my tumour which was located at the base of my skull traditional radiotherapy was only able to slow down its growth, whereas proton beam therapy was able to get rid of it completely. By bringing proton beam therapy to the UK, patients like me will no longer have to travel abroad to receive this life-saving treatment - it s a moment that can t come soon enough.  Across the world proton beam therapy has been shown to deliver significant results for patients, especially in lowering side effects. There are currently no operational proton beam therapy facilities in the UK and the demand for more specialized cancer care is growing. Proton Partners are at the forefront of bringing proton beam therapy to the UK and are working with class-leading providers which will equip the new centres to the highest specifications.

Their results, moreover, bring with them a possible antidote, an experimental compound dubbed CGP3466B. A summary of the study, which also found signs of autophagy in the brain cells of mice whose mothers received cocaine while pregnant, will be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. See Also: Novel compound halts cocaine addiction and relapse behaviors ""We performed 'autopsies' to find out how cells die from high doses of cocaine,"" says Solomon Snyder, MD, professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""That information gave us immediate insight into how we might use a known compound to interfere with that process and prevent the damage."" After discovering in 1990 that brain cells use the gas nitric oxide to communicate, Snyder and his research team have spent decades studying its impact. In 2013, the team found that nitric oxide is involved in cocaine-induced cell death through its interactions with GAPDH, an enzyme, but didn't learn how precisely the cells were dying. To find out, the research team examined nerve cells from mouse brains for clues. Snyder says cells, like whole animals, can die from extreme temperatures, toxins and physical trauma, but can also commit ""suicide"" in three ways that are chemically programmed and controlled by different proteins. One such way is autophagy, a normal and much-needed cellular ""cleanup process"" that rids cells of debris that accumulates in membrane-enclosed vacuoles, or ""bags"" within the cell. These bags fuse with other bags, enzyme-rich lysosomes, which are filled with acids that degrade the contents of the vacuoles. Only when this process accelerates and spins out of control does it cause cell death, Snyder explains. By measuring changes in the levels of proteins that control each cell death program and by observing the cells' physical changes, the team saw clearly that cocaine causes neuronal cell death through out-of-control autophagy. That confirmed previous results from two other groups that found cocaine-induced autophagy in astrocytes and microglia, which are neuron support cells. ""A cell is like a household that is constantly generating trash,"" says Prasun Guha, PhD, postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins and lead author of the paper. ""Autophagy is the housekeeper that takes out the trash -- it's usually a good thing. But cocaine makes the housekeeper throw away really important things, like mitochondria, which produce energy for the cell."" Learn More: New insights on how cocaine changes the brain Because the team already knew that nitric oxide and GAPDH were involved in the process, they tested the ability of the compound CGP3466B, known to disrupt nitric oxide/GAPDH interactions, to halt cocaine-induced autophagy. They also tested other chemicals known to prevent the other two forms of cellular suicide, but only CGP3466B protected mouse nerve cells in the brain from death by cocaine. According to previous research from the same team, CGP3466B was also able to rescue the brain cells of live mice from the deadly effects of cocaine, but they had not connected the phenomenon to autophagy. When the scientists recently gave mice a single dose of cocaine and looked for signs of autophagy in their brain cells, they detected autophagy-associated proteins and changes in vacuoles in adults and in mouse pups whose mothers had received cocaine while pregnant. ""Since cocaine works exclusively to modulate autophagy versus other cell death programs, there's a better chance that we can develop new targeted therapeutics to suppress its toxicity,"" says Maged M. Harraz, PhD, a research associate at Johns Hopkins and lead co-author of the paper. Snyder says the team hopes its work will eventually lead to treatments that protect adults and infants from the devastating effects of cocaine on the brain. Since CGP3466B has already been tested in phase II clinical trials to (unsuccessfully) treat Parkinson's disease and ALS, it is known to be safe for humans, but the researchers caution that many more years of studies are needed to definitively show whether it is effective for preventing cocaine damage, first in mice, then in humans. They also want to create and test derivatives of CGP3466B to learn more about cocaine-induced autophagy and see if cocaine is killing any cells outside the brain.

During normal development of the nervous system, axons must grow towards specific locations and make precise connections with other neurons. In CFEOM3, the nervous system governing eye movements does not develop properly because of defects in axon guidance that are associated with mutations in the protein  3-tubulin.

""Surprisingly, the kinesin mutants that we created effectively rescued kinesin motility and axonal growth, even in live mice."" The team began looking at the role of a specific amino acid location on  3-tubulin called R262, because the R262 mutation is the most common mutation in patients with CFEOM3. Using a recently developed baculovirus-insect cell-expression system, they first found that in vitro, this mutation does indeed inhibit the ability of kinesin specifically the kinesin KIF5B to move along microtubules formed from  3-tubulin. In fact, the kinesin would not even bind to the mutant microtubules. The team reasoned that if they knew what part of the kinesin interacted with the microtubule, they could then look for kinesins with mutations at that location, and perhaps find one that was able to move along the R262 mutant microtubules. The crystal structure of the kinesin-microtubule complex indicated that  3-tubulin binds to kinesin KIF5B at location D279. After several experiments, they found what they were looking for: replacing D279 with another amino acid making a D279R mutant allowed the kinesin to move along  3-tubulin microtubules with the R262 mutation.

When patients with such injuries arrive in the hospital, doctors must be able to accurately measure intracranial pressure in the brain and inside the skull because an increase in pressure can lead to further brain injury, and there is no way to reliably estimate pressure levels from brain scans or clinical features in patients. ""However, the devices commonly used today are based on technology from the 1980s,"" Murphy explained. ""They're large, they're unwieldy, and they have wires that connect to monitors in the intensive care unit. They give accurate readings, and they help, but there are ways to make them better."" Murphy collaborated with engineers in the laboratory of John A. Rogers, PhD, a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois, to build new sensors. The devices are made mainly of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and silicone, and they can transmit accurate pressure and temperature readings, as well as other information.

""This type of bio-electric medicine has great potential in many areas of clinical care."" The researchers tested the sensors in baths of saline solution that caused them to dissolve after a few days. Next, they tested the devices in the brains of laboratory rats. Having shown that the sensors are accurate and that they dissolve in the solution and in the brains of rats, the researchers now are planning to test the technology in patients. ""In terms of the major challenges involving size and scale, we've already crossed some key bridges,"" said co-senior author Wilson Z Ray, MD, assistant professor of neurological and orthopaedic surgery at Washington University. In patients with traumatic brain injuries, neurosurgeons attempt to decrease the pressure inside the skull using medications. If pressure cannot be reduced sufficiently, patients often undergo surgery. The new devices could be placed into the brain at multiple locations during such operations. ""The ultimate strategy is to have a device that you can place in the brain or in other organs in the body that is entirely implanted, intimately connected with the organ you want to monitor and can transmit signals wirelessly to provide information on the health of that organ, allowing doctors to intervene if necessary to prevent bigger problems,"" Murphy said. ""And then after the critical period that you actually want to monitor, it will dissolve away and disappear.""

Their findings clarify what prompts the inflammatory response that results in BPD, which previously had been unclear. The study, published in Nature Communications, determined how the NLRP3 inflammasome activates the protein Interleukin 1 beta, which in turn triggers inflammation and development of BPD. In an animal model of BPD, researchers also tested two FDA-approved drugs that either block the effect of or decrease the production of Interleukin 1 beta and found that these treatments allowed more normal lung development. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a common chronic lung disease in premature infants, develops as a result of the ventilation and oxygen necessary for these infants to survive. Infants born before 30 weeks gestation have immature lungs that lack surfactant, a substance comprised of phospholipids and proteins that is needed for lungs to properly function. This causes premature infants to develop respiratory distress syndrome, requiring the aid of mechanical ventilation. The infants  exposure to elevated oxygen levels during ventilation activates the process of inflammation that leads to BPD.  The same ventilation that ultimately saves their lives, damages their lungs,  said Dr. Rashmin Savani, Professor and Chief of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine, and senior author of the study.  Our findings suggest that if we target premature infants born at less than 28 weeks gestation from three to 10 days after birth with this therapy, we might be able to drastically reduce or even eliminate the development of BPD.  Dr. Savani also holds the William Buchanan Chair in Pediatrics. To confirm NLRP3 s role in regulating the inflammatory process of BPD, researchers used neonatal animal models exposed to 85 percent oxygen, which is a key cause of the inflammation and decreased development of tiny air sacs in the lungs called alveoli. They also examined tracheal aspirate samples from premature infants to establish the importance of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the development of BPD. Some current treatments for BPD include close monitoring of fluid buildup in the infant s lungs as well as the use of bronchodilators, steroids, and diuretics. However, to date, very few approaches have prevented the development of BPD or reduced its severity, including the use of caffeine to prevent premature apnea (suspension of external breathing) and vitamin A given in the first four weeks of life. The current findings identify a new target for the prevention of BPD or reducing its severity. Previous studies have examined the role that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays in the development of other inflammatory diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis, but no one has looked at its role in human BPD development. Next steps include testing the therapeutic intervention strategies outlined in this study in larger animal models, potentially followed by a Phase 1 clinical trial.","Published: January 16, 2016"

The study, published in Pharmacotherapy, examined patients diagnosed with migraines and treated with medical marijuana between Jan. 2010 and Sept. 2014. It found the frequency of migraines dropped from 10.4 to 4.6 headaches per month, a number considered statistically and clinically significant.

""There was a substantial improvement for patients in their ability to function and feel better,"" said the study's senior author Professor Laura Borgelt, PharmD, FCCP, BCPS. ""Like any drug, marijuana has potential benefits and potential risks. It's important for people to be aware that using medical marijuana can also have adverse effects."" The study looked at the charts of patients treated at Gedde Whole Health, a private medical practice in Colorado that specializes in recommending marijuana for a variety of conditions. About a two-thirds of the patients studied had a history of or were currently using cannabis at the time of their initial visit. The researchers found various forms of cannabis utilized. Inhaled marijuana appeared to be the favorite for treating acute migraines while edible cannabis, which takes longer to impact the body, helped prevent headaches. Borgelt said cannabinoid receptors can be found throughout the body, including the brain, connective tissues and immune system. And they appear to have anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties. These cannabinoids also seem to affect critical neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. Learn More: Marijuana derivative reduces seizures in people with treatment-resistant epilepsy ""We believe serotonin plays a role in migraine headaches, but we are still working to discover the exact role of cannabinoids in this condition,"" Borgelt said.

The ideal study, she said, would be a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial with a marijuana washout period prior to start. It would also require providing subjects with standardized quantities and potencies of medical marijuana while tracking the occurrence of migraines just like prescription drug studies. But given federal anti-drug laws, that kind of study would likely require legislative changes before it could be done, Borgelt said.

For years, it was assumed that neuroanatomy was remarkably similar across this large and diverse group. A recent study by University of Illinois (U of I) researchers turns that assumption on its head.  It was a comparative study looking at all of these different species of nematodes, including some parasites, and seeing that there are some substantial differences in the number of neurons in the ventral cord,  says U of I nematologist Nathan Schroeder. See Also: Neuroscientists decode the brain activity of the worm According to Schroeder, discovering this degree of variation across the group suggests that neuron number and anatomy may have changed numerous times during nematode evolution. This is significant because the evolution of nervous systems is notoriously difficult to study in complex higher animals. Being able to study the relatively simple nervous system in nematodes can shed light on some basic research questions in nervous system evolution.  This group of animals has the simplicity that makes it easy to work with in the lab, but there are these differences across species. So, we can target that and figure out how nervous systems are evolving.  On a more practical level, the results of this study may lead to development of new nematicides pesticides that target plant-parasitic nematodes.  We know from some of the old nematicides that the nervous system is a very effective target. Unfortunately, some of those nematicides were very broad spectrum and would target anything with a nervous system, including us,  Schroeder noted. The study showed that soybean cyst nematodes, a major crop pest in Illinois, may have unique neurons that could be targeted by new nematicides to avoid harming beneficial soil organisms. More research will be required to determine whether such a product could be developed, but the study indicates that the potential may exist.   The authors are now focusing their attention on soybean cyst nematodes to identify unique neurons and to learn more about how those neurons affect the movement of the microscopic roundworms in the soil and in soybean plants.

The odor signature appears in urine before significant development of Alzheimer-related brain pathology, suggesting that it may be possible to develop a non-invasive tool for early diagnosis of Alzheimer s disease.  Previous research from the USDA and Monell has focused on body odor changes due to exogenous sources such as viruses or vaccines. Now we have evidence that urinary odor signatures can be altered by changes in the brain characteristic of Alzheimer s disease,  said study author Bruce Kimball, PhD, a chemical ecologist with the USDA National Wildlife Research Center who is stationed at the Monell Center.  This finding may also have implications for other neurologic diseases.  See Also: Imaging test may identify biomarker of Alzheimer's disease Identification of an early biomarker for Alzheimer s disease could potentially allow physicians to diagnose the debilitating disorder before the onset of brain decline and mental deterioration, paving the way for upcoming treatments to slow early progression of the disease. Alzheimer s, the most common form of dementia, afflicts an estimated 5.1 million Americans over the age of 65. There is no test to definitively diagnose Alzheimer s disease in living persons. Although the progression of Alzheimer s currently cannot be stopped or reversed, an accurate diagnosis can give patients and families time to plan for the future and seek treatments for symptom relief.  While this research is at the proof-of-concept stage, the identification of distinctive odor signatures may someday point the way to human biomarkers to identify Alzheimer s at early stages,  said study author Daniel Wesson, PhD, a neuroscientist at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. In the study, published in the online journal Scientific Reports, researchers studied three separate mouse models, known as APP mice, which mimic Alzheimer s-related brain pathology. Using both behavioral and chemical analyses, the researchers found that each strain of APP mice produced urinary odor profiles that could be distinguished from those of control mice. The odor changes did not result from the appearance of new chemical compounds, but instead reflected a relative shift of the concentrations of existing urinary compounds. The odor differences between APP and control mice were mostly independent of age and preceded detectable amounts of plaque build-up in the brains of the APP mice. These findings suggest that the characteristic odor signature is related to the presence of an underlying gene rather than to the actual development of pathological changes in the brain. Additional studies showed that the distinctive odor profiles could be used to predicatively identify APP mice versus control mice. Learn more: Novel biomarker predicts febrile seizure-related epilepsy Because Alzheimer s is a uniquely human disease, scientists create models of associated brain pathology to study the disease in mice. One of the hallmark pathological indicators of Alzheimer s disease is an excess formation of amyloid plaque deposits in the brain. Scientists mimic this pathology in mouse models by introducing human genes associated with mutations of the amyloid-  precursor protein gene into the mouse genome. These genes are then pharmacologically activated to make excess amyloid-  protein, leading to plaque buildup in the brains of APP mice. Wesson and study co-author Donald Wilson of the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research and New York University School of Medicine utilize the mouse Alzheimer s models to examine the role of olfactory dysfunction as an early biomarker of Alzheimer s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. The researchers note that extensive studies are needed to identify and characterize Alzheimer s-related odor signatures in humans.

The study reveals how birds learn songs through observation and practice, and the authors hope the work will guide future research into how patients with brain injuries might reacquire the ability to learn skilled behaviors like speech. See Also: Brain size matters when it comes to animal self-control  While we have known for decades that adolescent songbirds only learn their songs if exposed to a tutor, we believe our study is the first to detail changes in nerve networks that make this mastery possible in maturing brains,  says senior study investigator Michael Long, PhD.  Our results show that finch song learning reflects a  dance  inside the brain s vocal control center between nerve cells that capture information as the bird listens and those that direct muscle movement as it sings,  says Long, an assistant professor of neuroscience at NYU Langone. In the current study, led by Daniela Vallentin, PhD, and Georg Kosche in the Druckenmiller Neuroscience Institute at NYU Langone Medical Center, the research team found that early in adolescence, just listening to a father s song turns on the same brain cell networks that the young bird will use later to sing the song once learned. A second result revolves around a set of nerve cells in the brain called inhibitory interneurons, which dampen the activity of surrounding nerves to sculpt sensory input into function. Researchers found that interneurons suppress the impact of each note in a father s song as soon as it is learned,  locking  it into the younger bird s memory piece by piece.  Our research advances the understanding of how skilled behaviors are learned, and the role played by sensory inhibition in making memorized patterns permanent,  says Long. Such a framework, he says, could apply to complex behaviors in people, such as dancing or hitting a baseball. For the study, researchers used electrodes to track brain cell activity in young zebra finches as they learned songs from a mentoring parent over several weeks. Typically zebra finches learn songs during their adolescence, which begins roughly a month after birth and lasts 100 days, during which they practice each song hundreds of thousands of times. Specifically, researchers found that the influence of the parent on the adolescent s nerve circuits gradually decreased as songs were learned, and that fast learners had faster brain changes. The electrode experiments examined the cooperation between premotor neurons that control singing and inhibitory interneurons that together enabled song learning. After the courtship songs were learned, none of the premotor neurons turned on in response to a tutor s song. Inhibitory signals from interneurons had formed  a barrier  over the learned notes, rendering them impervious to parental influence. Long says the team will next conduct experiments that seek to clarify how networks of inhibitory interneurons  tell the difference  between songbird notes that have been mastered and those still being learned. Knowing that may guide future attempts to roll back inhibitory barriers established as behaviors are learned, making brain circuits available once again for the learning of skilled behaviors lost to injury or stroke.

The team's findings in animal models point to a way that a drug might someday return this lipid to normal levels, perhaps making it easier for smokers to quit. ""We knew these lipids were implicated in nicotine addiction, but until now manipulating their synthesis was not pharmacologically feasible,"" said TSRI Professor Loren (Larry) Parsons, senior author of the new study, which involved a close collaboration with the TSRI labs of Professor Marisa Roberto and Benjamin F. Cravatt, chair of the Department of Chemical Physiology and member of the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at TSRI. See Also: Smoking thins vital part of brain The study is published online in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The motivation for natural rewards such as food, sex and exercise and also of drugs such as nicotine relies on neurons in the brain's reward system, based in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Obtaining a reward leads to excitation of these neurons and the release of dopamine, which acts on other neurons to trigger positive emotions. The degree to which the reward system can be activated is normally tightly controlled. The neurotransmitter GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) inhibits excitatory signaling in neurons and keeps the system in balance. Chronic nicotine exposure sabotages this carefully balanced system. Previous research indicated that chronic nicotine exposure boosts the excitation of dopamine signaling while decreasing the controls on this system by GABA's inhibitory signaling. ""This is thought to contribute in part to the motivation for continued nicotine use,"" explained Parsons. Dopamine doesn't act alone. Nicotine exposure also leads to the release of lipids called endocannabinoids, which affect dopamine-producing neurons. Because of this, some researchers have tested potential anti-smoking therapies that block activity in the endocannabinoid receptor, where endocannabinoids bind. These treatments reduced the effects of nicotine on dopamine release and tended to reduce smoking. ""Unfortunately these treatments also produced undesirable side effects, like depression and anxiety, that limited their clinical use,"" said TSRI Research Associate Matthew Buczynski, who was co-first author of the study with Melissa A Herman, senior research associate in the Roberto lab, and Ku-Lung Hsu, who was a research associate at TSRI at the time of the study and is currently an assistant professor at the University of Virginia. Learn More: Brains of smokers who quit successfully might be wired for success The team hypothesized that instead of blocking endocannabinoid receptors throughout the brain, it would be more effective to specifically target the endocannabinoid mechanism that appears to be dysregulated by chronic nicotine. The new study suggests compounds called 1,2,3-triazole urea (TU) inhibitors can block the production of a specific endocannabinoid called 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). These inhibitors were selected by Hsu for their potential to inhibit the source of 2-AG itself: an enzyme called diacylglycerol lipase. Next, Herman led studies of the cellular effects of chronic nicotine exposure on GABA signaling in rat brains. These experiments revealed a strong correlation between enhanced production of 2-AG by diacylglycerol lipase and decreased GABA levels. The team then targeted the 2-AG pathway using the 1,2,3-TU inhibitors characterized by Hsu. ""This research was a real team effort, and the quality of the science reflects the respective strengths of the team,"" said Herman. The researchers found that in animal models with a history of nicotine exposure, GABA signaling returned to normal when the effects of nicotine on 2-AG production were prevented with the 1,2,3-TU inhibitors. Blocking 2-AG production also affected the motivation to consume nicotine. Buczynski observed that treating rats with the 1,2,3-TU inhibitors reduced voluntary nicotine self-administration without changing the motivation for natural rewards (for example, water self-administration by thirsty rats). ""This suggests 2-AG acts as a molecular switch for turning an important inhibitory control of dopamine neurons on and off,"" said Buczynski. If this switch is turned off, as in those with chronic nicotine exposure, the excitation of dopamine neurons by nicotine is less controlled, and the drug is more rewarding. The findings could guide future therapies, perhaps enabling scientists to design therapeutics that prevent aberrant 2-AG activity without affecting other healthy activity at the endocannabinoid receptor. The study also opens a door to new basic research, noted Parsons. Because endocannabinoids influence many aspects of behavior, inhibitors similar to 1,2,3-TU compounds may be the key to investigating normal brain function.

Simplot will still need to complete its registration with the Environmental Protection Agency for these potatoes before introducing them for sale in the U.S. marketplace. The FDA s safety consultation was voluntarily requested by Simplot and comes shortly after the U.S. Department of Agriculture also deregulated the same potatoes. These federal clearances involved a thorough technical review and a public comment period that drew the support of leading potato research universities in the U.S. and Europe. Simplot s second generation of Innate potatoes contains four benefits of relevance to potato growers, processors and consumers: reduced bruising and black spots; reduced asparagine; resistance to late blight pathogens; and enhanced cold storage capability. These benefits were achieved by adapting genes from wild and cultivated potatoes. Academics consulted by Simplot estimate that the Innate late blight resistance trait can result in a 25-45% reduction in fungicide applications annually to control late blight. Reduced asparagine means that accumulation levels of acrylamide can be reduced by up to 90 percent when these potatoes are cooked at high temperatures. In addition, lowered reducing sugars enable cold storage at 38 F for more than six months without the build-up of sugars, which maintains quality, and which cannot be achieved until today.  Based on these academic estimates, if all Russet Burbank potatoes in the United States had Innate Gen. 2 traits, it is estimated that potato waste (in-field, during storage, packing, retail and foodservice for fresh potatoes) could be reduced by 986 million pounds. In addition, CO2 emissions could be reduced by 146 million pounds, water usage reduced by 17 billion gallons, and a total of 495,000 fewer pesticide acre-applications would be needed.  The Innate Gen. 2 potato is a major advancement in the potato industry,  said Duane Grant, potato farmer and owner of Grant 4D Farms in Rupert, Idaho.  Late blight disease can and does wreak havoc on organic and conventional potato crops and now we have an effective solution that should reduce fungicide use and reduce the millions of pounds of wasted potatoes each year.  Late blight, the disease responsible for the historic Irish potato famine, is caused by a fungus-like pathogen and still has the potential to devastate world potato crops. Innate Gen. 2 potatoes contain a gene from a South American wild potato species that provides natural resistance to certain strains of the pathogen.  We re excited to continue momentum on our Innate technology platform,  said Haven Baker, vice president and general manager of Simplot Plant Sciences.  In our first two generations we have addressed the issues of plant disease, health and quality by harnessing the strongest traits within the potato family and we re now set to address global potato challenges.

NHGRI also announced the next phase of a complementary program, the Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMG), which will continue investigating the genomic underpinnings of rare, typically inherited diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy.  Advances in DNA sequencing are creating tremendous new opportunities for exploring how the genome plays a role in human disease,  said NHGRI Director Eric Green, M.D., Ph.D.  Our continued focus on both rare and common diseases promises to reveal important aspects about the genomic architecture of a wide range of human disorders.  CCDG researchers plan to examine a select group of disorders in order to develop approaches for using genome sequencing to study common disease more broadly. By sequencing an expected 150,000 to 200,000 genomes of individuals with these diseases, the CCDG program aims to improve understanding of how genomic differences among people influence disease risk and to develop models for future studies of common disease. CMG scientists will build on an international network of research collaborations and sequence the genomes of individuals with a wide range of rare disorders seen around the world. Together, the CCDG and CMG programs aim to discover the genes and genomic variants   spelling differences in DNA   that cause or contribute to disease, which may eventually lead to improved diagnosis and potential treatments. Pending the availability of funds, NHGRI will fund the CCDG and CMG programs for roughly $240 million and $40 million, respectively, over four years. NHGRI will also fund a new Coordinating Center for approximately $4 million over four years to facilitate research collaborations among the program grantees, and to contribute to data analysis and program outreach. In addition, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) will contribute to both the CCDG and CMG programs, while the National Eye Institute (NEI) will provide support to the CMG program.

Obtaining a reward leads to excitation of these neurons and the release of a neurotransmitter called dopamine, which acts on other neurons to trigger positive emotions. The degree to which the reward system can be activated is normally tightly controlled. A neurotransmitter called GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) inhibits excitatory signaling in neurons and keeps the system in balance. Chronic nicotine exposure sabotages this carefully balanced system. Previous research indicated that chronic nicotine exposure boosts the excitation of dopamine signaling while decreasing the controls on this system by GABA s inhibitory signaling.  This is thought to contribute in part to the motivation for continued nicotine use,  explained Parsons. Dopamine doesn t act alone. Nicotine exposure also leads to the release of lipids called endocannabinoids, which affect dopamine-producing neurons. Because of this, some researchers have tested potential anti-smoking therapies that block activity in the endocannabinoid receptor, where endocannabinoids bind. These treatments reduced the effects of nicotine on dopamine release and tended to reduce smoking.  Unfortunately these treatments also produced undesirable side effects, like depression and anxiety, that limited their clinical use,  said TSRI Research Associate Matthew Buczynski, who was co-first author of the study with Melissa A. Herman, senior research associate in the Roberto lab, and Ku-Lung Hsu, who was a research associate at TSRI at the time of the study and is currently an assistant professor at the University of Virginia. The team hypothesized that instead of blocking endocannabinoid receptors throughout the brain, it would be more effective to specifically target the endocannabinoid mechanism that appears to be dysregulated by chronic nicotine. Restoring the Brain s Balance The new study suggests compounds called 1,2,3-triazole urea (TU) inhibitors can block the production of a specific endocannabinoid called 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). These inhibitors were selected by Hsu for their potential to inhibit the source of 2-AG itself: an enzyme called diacylglycerol lipase. Next, Herman led studies of the cellular effects of chronic nicotine exposure on GABA signaling in rat brains. These experiments revealed a strong correlation between enhanced production of 2-AG by diacylglycerol lipase and decreased GABA levels. The team then targeted the 2-AG pathway using the 1,2,3-TU inhibitors characterized by Hsu.  This research was a real team effort, and the quality of the science reflects the respective strengths of the team,  said Herman. The researchers found that in animal models with a history of nicotine exposure, GABA signaling returned to normal when the effects of nicotine on 2-AG production were prevented with the 1,2,3-TU inhibitors. Blocking 2-AG production also affected the motivation to consume nicotine. Buczynski observed that treating rats with the 1,2,3-TU inhibitors reduced voluntary nicotine self-administration without changing the motivation for natural rewards (for example, water self-administration by thirsty rats).  This suggests 2-AG acts as a molecular switch for turning an important inhibitory control of dopamine neurons on and off,  said Buczynski. If this switch is turned off, as in those with chronic nicotine exposure, the excitation of dopamine neurons by nicotine is less controlled, and the drug is more rewarding.                                                                                     The findings could guide future therapies, perhaps enabling scientists to design therapeutics that prevent aberrant 2-AG activity without affecting other healthy activity at the endocannabinoid receptor. The study also opens a door to new basic research, noted Parsons. Because endocannabinoids influence many aspects of behavior, inhibitors similar to 1,2,3-TU compounds may be the key to investigating normal brain function.","Published: January 15, 2016"

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/why-do-some-infections-persist-214014,Why Do Some Infections Persist   In preparing for the possibility of an antibiotic onslaught  some bacterial cultures adopt an all for one one for all strategy that would make a socialist proud  University of Vermont researchers have found   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. This finding could have application for how persistent infections like those associated with cystic fibrosis are treated. The paper's conclusions are based on a series of time-lapse videos showing that single cells within a community of bacteria randomly use a cascade of proteins to become more or less antibiotic resistant, even when the community is not threatened by an antibiotic. A bacterial colony can regenerate if only a few cells survive antibiotic treatment. The paper's lead author is Imane El Meouche, a postdoctoral scholar in the School of Engineering in the College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences. Mary Dunlop, corresponding author, is an assistant professor in the School of Engineering. The second author is Yik Siu, a technician in the school.    It s costly from a metabolic standpoint for a cell to express the proteins that enable it to be resistant,  says Dunlop.  This strategy allows a colony to hedge its bets by enabling individual cells within a population to trade back and forth the work required for antibiotic resistance. That way the population will be prepared for an antibiotic threat, should one arise, but without doing the extra work that could put it at risk in other ways.  Previous research has demonstrated that, when exposed to some antibiotics, all the cells within a bacterial population will use the protein cascade strategy, activated by a mechanism called MarA, to become resistant. But the new study is among the first to show that colonies use the strategy even when they are not under threat.  This transient resistance, distributed in varying degrees among individual cells in a population, may be the norm for many bacterial populations,  Dunlop says. Clinical implication: Change dosing strategy to wait out an infection That may explain why infection persists in diseases like cystic fibrosis, she said. For these diseases, clinicians know not to use antibiotics that will stimulate population-level MarA resistance. But the persistence of a few straggler antibiotic-resistant cells, even after treatment with the right antibiotic, could be enough to keep the infection alive. The study suggests that altering the frequency and timing of antibiotic treatment could be a way of waiting out an infection as bacteria trade off antibiotic resistance, enabling the drug to kill the entire culture. Some antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, are resistant due to genetic changes such as mutations. Those studied by Dunlop and her colleagues alter their traits   protein expression, for instance   but not their genomes, making them significantly more difficult to identify since the resistance level of each bacterium changes over time.","Published: January 15, 2016"

But it s definitely worth it. These proteins play an active role in creating many common antibiotics. They are in constant motion, with sections that flip around acrobatically to carry out necessary tasks. Now, for the first time, McGill researchers have been able to take a series of 3D images of a large section from one of these medicine-synthesizing enzymes in action. The researchers believe that the images they have generated will not only bring scientists closer to understanding how many antibiotics are made, but could, with further research, lead to the development of much needed next-generation antibiotics.  This is the most complete view we ve ever had of these enzymes in action,  said Prof. Martin Schmeing from McGill s Department of Biochemistry, and the senior author of a paper describing the research.  Even though megaenzymes are the second-biggest proteins known to man, they are still very small molecules and they are very mobile, so it s difficult to see them at work.  Medicine is sometimes just battling bacteria The enzymes the researchers are working on are essential to the production of antibiotics that range from penicillin to cyclosporin. They are called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (or NRPSs) and act as catalysts inside specific bacteria, giving them the ability to kill all their competing bacteria. The NRPSs work like miniature assembly lines, combining building blocks through repetitive chemical reactions. Much like automobile assembly lines, these enzyme assembly lines are made up of different work stations (called modules) that each add on one section of the drug and in the process create antibiotics with new chemical features. Paralyzing proteins to take their picture Because these enzymes are too small to see and constantly in motion, Prof. Schmeing and his team, used chemical traps to capture the proteins in the desired position. They then used a technique called X-ray crystallography to essentially take a series of 3D pictures of the first module of an NRPS that makes the antibiotic gramicidin (an active ingredient of the Polysporin cream which may be in your medicine cabinet).   These 3D pictures revealed the totally remarkable way the NRPS works to synthesize its product. Parts of other NRPSs have been pictured before, but there have never been so many snapshots of the different steps of synthesis, and never pictures of NRPSs that incorporate interesting chemical modifications into the antibiotic,  says Janice Reimer, PhD student and the first author on the paper.  These pictures reveal the exquisite way these parts repurpose and recycle their limited surfaces to interact with the rest of the enzyme. Once we understand enough, we can use modern bioengineering techniques to modify NRPSs to produce all sorts of products with designer modifications, perhaps giving a veritable treasure trove of new medicines.

""Previous research from the USDA and Monell has focused on body odor changes due to exogenous sources such as viruses or vaccines. Now we have evidence that urinary odor signatures can be altered by changes in the brain characteristic of Alzheimer's disease,"" said study author Bruce Kimball, Ph.D., a chemical ecologist with the USDA National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) who is stationed at the Monell Center. ""This finding may also have implications for other neurologic diseases."" Identification of an early biomarker for Alzheimer's disease could potentially allow physicians to diagnose the debilitating disorder before the onset of brain decline and mental deterioration, paving the way for upcoming treatments to slow early progression of the disease. Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, afflicting an estimated 5.1 million Americans over the age of 65. There is no test to definitively diagnose Alzheimer's disease in living persons. Although the progression of Alzheimer's currently cannot be stopped or reversed, an accurate diagnosis can give patients and families time to plan for the future and seek treatments for symptom relief. ""While this research is at the proof-of-concept stage, the identification of distinctive odor signatures may someday point the way to human biomarkers to identify Alzheimer's at early stages,"" said study author Daniel Wesson, Ph.D., a neuroscientist at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. In the study researchers studied three separate mouse models, known as APP mice, which mimic Alzheimer's-related brain pathology. Using both behavioral and chemical analyses, the researchers found that each strain of APP mice produced urinary odor profiles that could be distinguished from those of control mice. The odor changes did not result from the appearance of new chemical compounds, but instead reflected a relative shift of the concentrations of existing urinary compounds. The odor differences between APP and control mice were mostly independent of age and preceded detectable amounts of plaque build-up in the brains of the APP mice. These findings suggest that the characteristic odor signature is related to the presence of an underlying gene rather than to the actual development of pathological changes in the brain. Additional studies showed that the distinctive odor profiles could be used to predicatively identify APP mice versus control mice. Because Alzheimer's is a uniquely human disease, scientists create models of associated brain pathology to study the disease in mice. One of the hallmark pathological indicators of Alzheimer's disease is an excess formation of amyloid plaque deposits in the brain. Scientists mimic this pathology in mouse models by introducing human genes associated with mutations of the amyloid-  precursor protein gene into the mouse genome. These genes are then pharmacologically activated to make excess amyloid-  protein, leading to plaque buildup in the brains of APP mice. Wesson and study co-author Donald Wilson of the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research and New York University School of Medicine utilize the mouse Alzheimer's models to examine the role of olfactory dysfunction as an early biomarker of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. The researchers note that extensive studies are needed to identify and characterize Alzheimer's-related odor signatures in humans.","Published: January 15, 2016"

The findings, by researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, were published recently. While oxidative stress is a common way for cell damage to occur, the findings were a surprise in some ways. ""Oxidative stress is occurring selectively even at low levels of exposure to nanoparticles,"" said Brian Thrall, a nanotoxicology expert at PNNL and a corresponding author of the study. ""We've demonstrated an approach that is sensitive enough to detect effects of nanoparticles on macrophages long before those cells die. This gives us the opportunity to understand the most sensitive cellular targets of oxidative stress and the pathways involved more completely than before. ""This is important information for understanding how nanoparticles can alter cell function and for beginning to identify functions that allow cells to adapt versus those that are potentially involved in adverse effects,"" Thrall added. Nanoparticles are typically smaller than 100 nanometers wide, less than one one-thousandth the width of a human hair. If a standard basketball were blown up to the size of the Earth, a nanoparticle enlarged proportionately would be roughly the size of a beach ball in comparison. The particles are used broadly in biomedical applications, clothing, the electronics industry, cosmetics, food packaging and sunscreens; they're also a component in many forms of air pollution. As scientists have refined their ability to make a diversity of nanoparticles used in manufactured goods, there is a greater need to study their potential effects. Oftentimes, these studies look at whether or not exposure to the particles results in cell death. The PNNL study is more nuanced, looking in more depth at specific proteins in cells that are the targets of oxidative damage caused by nanoparticles. ""This study shows that some nanoparticles which we consider non-toxic can have many effects on macrophages,"" said analytical chemist Wei-Jun Qian, also a corresponding author of the study. The findings depend on a method recently developed by PNNL scientists to measure protein oxidation at very specific sites in cells like macrophages. Qian developed a very sensitive measure of protein modifications in cells to allow scientists to look at specific sites in the cell where scientists know certain functions are carried out. The method, known as a quantitative redox proteomics approach, utilizes an advanced mass spectrometer to look at thousands of sites involved in redox reactions simultaneously. Thrall's and Qian's teams worked together to analyze modifications in all the proteins in mouse cells. The group looked at the effects of three types of nanoparticles which vary in their potential to cause oxidative stress and cell death:   Silicon oxide, also known as amorphous silica, which scientists consider a low-toxicity nanoparticle;   Iron oxide, which causes moderate oxidative stress levels but is generally not sufficient to kill cells;   Cobalt oxide, which causes high levels of oxidative stress and can also cause cell death and lung toxicity. The team took a close look at more than 2,000 cellular hotspots where a process known as S-glutathionylation, a specific type of protein modification known to be involved in immune functions when a cell is under oxidative stress, occurs. In macrophages exposed to nanoparticles, the team found molecular ""footprints"" of activity   an increase in S-glutathionylation. However, the specific pattern of oxidative modifications on proteins varied depending on the type of nanoparticle. By looking at these modifications, researchers were able to identify specific molecular pathways that were most sensitive to low levels of oxidative stress, and distinguish those from other pathways that were associated with high levels of oxidative stress linked to cell death. The idea that a nanoparticle would damage the body's macrophages is no surprise: Macrophages are the body's first responders when it comes to recognizing and neutralizing an invader. Some nanoparticles can weaken macrophages' ability to recognize, hold onto and engulf the particles. Two years ago, Thrall's team showed that when macrophages are exposed to nanoparticles, the cells don't work as well and are less able to recognize and remove Streptococcus pneumonia, the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia. The pattern of protein changes identified in this study provides new clues to the types of nanoparticles that cause these effects and the proteins involved. Qian developed the method as part of his work studying redox reactions which play an important role regulating photosynthesis in plants. Understanding how plants capture, process and funnel the Sun's energy naturally helps scientists develop efficient new energy systems to do the same. Qian has used the system to discover more than 2,100 molecular locations where redox reactions are likely to occur in cyanobacteria, which are important for producing biofuels. The work by Qian's group is funded in part by an Early Career Research Award from the Department of Energy, as well as an NIH Director's New Innovator Award. The spectrometric analyses took place at EMSL, the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, a DOE Office of Science User Facility at PNNL.

This approach, if developed into an implantable sensor, could be useful for monitoring patients who are taking blood thinners, allowing doctors to make sure the drugs aren t interfering too much with blood clotting. The new method is the first to create synthetic recognition sites (similar to natural antibodies) for proteins and to couple them directly to a powerful nanosensor such as a carbon nanotube. The researchers have also made significant progress on a similar recognition site for insulin, which could enable better monitoring of patients with diabetes. It may also be possible to use this approach to detect proteins associated with cancer or heart disease, says Michael Strano, the Carbon P. Dubbs Professor in Chemical Engineering at MIT. A targeted search The new sensor is the latest example of a method developed in Strano s lab, known asCorona Phase Molecular Recognition (CoPhMoRe). This technique takes advantage of the interactions between a given polymer and a nanoparticle surface such as that of a fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotube, when the polymer is wrapped around the nanotube. Certain regions of the polymers latch onto the nanoparticle surface like anchors, while other regions extend outwards into their environment. This outward-facing region, also known as the adsorbed phase or corona, has a 3-D structure that depends on the composition of the polymer.  CoPhMoRe works when a specific polymer adsorbs to the nanoparticle surface and creates a corona that recognizes the target molecule. These interactions are very specific, just like the binding between an antibody and its target. Binding of the target alters the carbon nanotubes  natural fluorescence, allowing the researchers to measure how much of the target molecule is present. Strano s lab has previously used this approach to find recognition sites and develop nansensors for estradiol and riboflavin, among other molecules. The new paper represents their first attempt to identify corona phases that can detect proteins, which are larger, more complex, and more fragile than the molecules identified by their previous sensors. For this study, Bisker began by screening carbon nanotubes wrapped in 20 different polymers including DNA, RNA, and polyethylene glycol (PEG), a polymer often added to drugs to increase their longevity in the bloodstream. On their own, none of the polymers had any affinity for the 14 proteins tested, all taken from human blood. However, when the researchers tested polymer-wrapped nanotubes against the same proteins, they turned up a match between one of the modified nanotubes and fibrinogen.  A chemist or a biologist would not be able to predict ahead of time that there should be any kind of affinity between fibrinogen and this corona phase,  Strano says.  It really is a new kind of molecular recognition.  Fibrinogen, one of the most abundant proteins in human blood, is part of the blood-clotting cascade. When a blood vessel is damaged, an enzyme called thrombin converts fibrinogen into fibrin, a stringy protein that forms clots to seal the wound. A sensor for fibrinogen could help doctors determine if patients who are taking blood thinners still have enough clotting capability to protect them from injury, and could allow doctors to calculate more finely tuned dosages. It could also be used to test patients  blood clotting before they go into surgery, or to monitor wound healing, Bisker says. Synthetic antibodies The researchers believe their synthetic molecular recognition agents are an improvement over existing natural systems based on antibodies or DNA sequences known as aptamers, which are more fragile and tend to degrade over time.  One of the advantages of this is that it s a completely synthetic system that can have a much longer lifetime within the body,  Bisker says. In 2013, researchers in Strano s lab demonstrated that carbon nanotube sensors can remain active in mice for more than a year after being embedded in a polymer gel and surgically implanted under the skin. In addition to insulin, the researchers are also interested in detecting troponin, a protein that is released by dying heart cells, or detecting proteins associated with cancer, which would be useful for monitoring the success of chemotherapy. These and other protein sensors could become critical components of devices that deliver drugs in response to a sign of illness.  By measuring therapeutic markers in the human body in real time, we can enable drug delivery systems that are much smarter, and release drugs in precise quantities,  Strano says.  However, measurement of those biomarkers is the first step. ","Published: January 15, 2016"

The therapy is remarkably effective in vivo and shows several advantages, such as no toxicity and getting good results in very low dosages,  said senior author Michael King, the Daljit S. and Elaine Sarkaria Professor in Cornell sMeinig School of Biomedical Engineering.  It was our wildest dream to completely prevent the spread of prostate cancer. And that s what happened in this system. Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from one tumor to other organs of the body, such as the lungs, the liver, the spleen and the kidneys. While surgery and radiation treat primary tumors, it remains difficult to detect and reach metastatic cancer cells   which makes the treatment of spreading cancer more treacherous and problematic, King explains. King s laboratory created nano-sized liposomes with a protein called TRAIL (Tumor Necrosis Factor Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand) that attach to leukocytes (white blood cells). The liposomes are about one-one hundredth the size of the white blood cells. As the white blood cells travel throughout the bloodstream, the hitchhiking TRAIL protein kills the tumor cells   leaving the bloodstream free of cancer. In the study prostate cancer cells were implanted into the prostate of male mice to let the tumors grow. The researchers found that secondary tumors were prevented by the treatment and that the primary tumor shrunk in size. While treated mice showed no metastases, the circulating tumor cell count remained greatly reduced but not completely zero, which leads scientists to believe  you don t have to be perfect in completely eliminating circulating tumor cells to observe a very good outcome,  said King. Further, the King group found that a single dose of the therapy   even delivered very late in the course of the disease   can substantially reduce the number of tumor cells. King said:  This suggests that it may never be too late to help. ","Published: January 15, 2016"

The vaccine, TV003, was developed by scientists in the laboratory of Stephen Whitehead, Ph.D., at NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The Butantan Institute, a non-profit producer of immunobiologic products for Brazil, licensed the NIAID dengue vaccine technology and is sponsoring the placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 3 trial using test vaccine produced in Sao Paulo. Dengue fever is common in many parts of the tropics and subtropics and about half the world s population is at risk of infection. The World Health Organization estimates that up to 400 million dengue infections occur annually, resulting in 500,000 hospitalizations. More than 1.5 million cases of dengue were reported in Brazil in 2015. Dengue is caused by any of four related viruses, termed serotypes DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4, which are transmitted to people by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. A person exposed to one dengue virus type gains immunity to that type, but not to the other three. In fact, a second infection with a virus type that differs from the first can lead to a more severe course of disease.  Researchers in NIAID s Laboratory of Infectious Diseases spent many years developing and testing dengue vaccine candidates designed to elicit antibodies against all four dengue virus serotypes,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  Earlier clinical trialsof this candidate conducted in the United States by NIAID showed that it could elicit a robust antibody and cellular immune response after just one dose,  he added.  Because the impact of dengue fever in Brazil is especially large and the country has an excellent health infrastructure, it is an ideal location to test the vaccine candidate.  The new trial aims to enroll almost 17,000 healthy people aged 2 to 59 years in 13 cities, beginning in Sao Paulo. Two-thirds of the volunteers will receive a single dose of the candidate vaccine, while one-third will receive an inactive placebo injection. Neither participants nor study staff will know which of the two groups a volunteer is in. All volunteers will be monitored for five years through a combination of in-person visits to the health clinic and telephone or text communications from the investigators. The goal of the trial is determine if the candidate vaccine prevents dengue fever and to provide additional information about its safety. Although the trial is scheduled to last five years, the investigators hope to have early indications of the potential efficacy of the vaccine in less than two years. The principal investigator is Alexander Precioso, M.D., Ph.D., of the Butantan Institute.","Published: January 15, 2016"

The protein is made from an RNA that was previously believed to be a blank or non-coding RNA, suggesting there may be many other small  non-coding  segments that play important biological roles. Significantly, the findings published in Science offer a potential new target for developing therapeutics to boost the strength of cardiac muscle contractions in patients with heart failure, a chronic condition in which the heart pumps too weakly to supply adequate oxygen to the body. The new protein, which the researchers have named dwarf open reading frame (DWORF), comprises just 34 amino acids, making it the third smallest protein known to be encoded in the mouse genome. By comparison, an average-sized protein is 10 times larger, including about 350 amino acids. DWORF is also encoded in the human genome. The DWORF protein stimulates a calcium-ion pump that controls muscle contraction. As DWORF increases, the heart pumps with more force.  There s a brake in the heart that controls pumping, and DWORF shuts off the brake, which has the effect of making heart muscle pump more vigorously,  said senior author Dr. Eric Olson, Chairman of the Molecular Biology, and Director of the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine at UT Southwestern. The researchers also found DWORF in some skeletal muscle, namely slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers, the type of muscle fiber that allows a person to run marathons. DWORF was found among a class of RNA transcripts that had been dismissed by scientists as non-coding RNA, sometimes colloquially called  junk  RNA. Emerging evidence, however, such as the discovery of DWORF, indicates that many small proteins with bioactive properties are hidden among these regions of the genome that are thought to be non-coding and, due to their small size, have evaded detection by scientists.  Although small and non-enzymatic themselves, peptides like DWORF have the ability to regulate the function of much larger molecular complexes, analogous to the way that a tiny rudder determines the direction of a much larger ship,  said Dr. Catherine Makarewich, a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Olson s lab and a co-lead author of the study.  Elucidating the full catalog of small proteins like DWORF could provide significant new insight into how the molecular machinery of the cell is regulated,  added Benjamin Nelson, a student in UT Southwestern s Medical Scientist Training Program and co-lead author of the study.  We dipped into the RNA  junk  pile and came up with a hidden treasure,  said Dr. Rhonda Bassel-Duby, Professor of Molecular Biology and a study author.","Published: January 15, 2016"

Dietary lipid contains fatty acids such as omega-6 and omega-3, which are essential nutrients for many animals and humans. The research group, led by Professor Noriko Osumi, found that a balanced intake of lipids by pregnant women is necessary for the normal brain formation of the unborn child. See Also: Researchers observe brain development in utero In an animal study, the researchers noticed that when female mice were fed an omega-6-rich/omega-3-poor diet, their offspring were born with a smaller brain and showed abnormal emotional behavior in adulthood. This is significant because people in many countries these days have similarly poor dietary patterns and tend to consume more seed oils that are rich in omega-6 fatty acids and less fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Credit: Noriko Osumi  According to Professor Osumi, the brain abnormality found in the offspring of mice used in the study, was caused by a premature aging of fetal neural stem cells that produce brain cells. The premature aging was promoted by an imbalance of oxides of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. The offspring also showed higher anxiety levels, even though they were raised on nutritionally optimized diets from an early lactation period. A diet that contains a good balance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids is known to improve the development of brain functions; this is based on earlier researches that evaluated the effects of maternal intake of an omega-3-poor diet on brain function in children. The new study took this premise further and focused on the effects of dietary lipids on the brain formation. The results reveal why omega-6 and omega-3 balance is important for future brain function, and reinforces earlier suggestions that more fish intake by women during pregnancy can advantageously affect the child's health.

The breakthrough in understanding a previously unknown function in the brain has implications for research into schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, Alzheimer's disease and other disorders where real experiences and ones that exist only in the mind can become distorted. See Also: Neurons in the Brain Tune into Different Frequencies for Different Spatial Memory Tasks The newly discovered mechanism, which compresses information needed for memory retrieval, imagination or planning and encodes it on a brain wave frequency that's separate from the one used for recording real-time experiences, is described in a cover article in the January 20 edition of the journal Neuron.Brain cells share different kinds of information with one another using a variety of different brain waves, analogous to the way radio stations broadcast on different frequencies. Laura Colgin, an assistant professor of neuroscience, Chenguang Zheng, a postdoctoral researcher, and their colleagues found that one of these frequencies allows us to play back memories or envision future activities in fast forward. ""The reason we're excited about it is that we think this mechanism can help explain how you can imagine a sequence of events you're about to do in a time-compressed manner,"" says Colgin. ""You can plan out those events and think about the sequences of actions you'll do. And all of that happens on a faster time scale when you're imagining it than when you actually go and do those things."" In the brain, fast gamma rhythms encode memories about things that are happening right now; these waves come rapidly one after another as the brain processes high-resolution information in real time. The scientists learned that slow gamma rhythms used to retrieve memories of the past, as well as imagine and plan for the future store more information on their longer waves, contributing to the fast-forward effect as the mind processes many data points with each wave. Mental compression turns out to be similar to what happens in a computer when you compress a file. Just like digital compression, when you replay a mental memory or imagine an upcoming sequence of events, these thoughts will have less of the rich detail found in the source material. The finding has implications for medicine as well as for criminal justice and other areas where memory reliability can be at issue. Colgin notes that the research could also explain why people with schizophrenia who are experiencing disrupted gamma rhythms have a hard time distinguishing between imagined and real experiences. ""Maybe they are transmitting their own imagined thoughts on the wrong frequency, the one usually reserved for things that are really happening,"" says Colgin. ""That could have terrible consequences."" Next, the researchers plan to use animals with neurological disorders similar to autism spectrum disorders and Alzheimer's disease in humans to better understand what role this mechanism plays and explore ways to counteract it.

We would not be able to speak, or even walk properly if we were not able to get the timing of each action just right. How are we able to track time? Are there a bunch of neural clocks ticking away somewhere deep inside our brain, cueing us on when to perform different actions? Recent results by neuroscientists at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown in Lisbon provide support to current theories in the field advocating the existence of such clocks and demonstrate, for the first time, that they can be used to predict behavior. See Also: Synchronized brain waves enable rapid learning ""We discovered that populations of neurons in a part of the brain called the striatum, which is known to be important for timing behavior, create sequences of activity that can be used to encode time and to predict timing behavior,"" says Dr Joe Paton, Principal Investigator at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown and the head of this study. The researchers were able to identify this mechanism by asking rats to decide whether two brief sounds were separated by a duration of more, or less than 1.5 seconds. At the same time, the researchers recorded the activity of multiple neurons in the striatum. ""By analyzing the activity of the neurons, we found that it could be used to encode time,"" says Dr Tiago Monteiro, a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Dr Paton and one of the authors of the study. ""Specifically, we found that upon the presentation of the first sound, a stereotypical wave-like activity took place within the group of recorded neurons. Throughout this wave, certain neurons would always be active earlier and others later. In this way, we could tell how much time had passed since the first sound by simply following the progression of the wave."" The idea that a stereotypical wave of neural activity can work as a clock is a model that has had robust support in the scientific community. According to this model, some neurons would be active earlier, and some later, so the brain could tell how much time had passed by simply observing which neuron is active. But how can the researchers confirm that the rat actually uses this clock to estimate time? ""To answer this question, we always have to look at what happens when the animal has to make difficult decisions, ones that are close to the boundary. It is easy enough for the rat to know that 2.5 seconds are longer than 1.5, but what about 1.6? Both animals and humans find these types of tasks very challenging. That's when their behavior becomes more variable. For the same duration, on some trials the animal might decide that it was long and on others, that it was short. We cannot predict when this will happen, but we can look at the neural activity and see if the neurons can,"" explains Dr Monteiro. And that is precisely what the researchers observed. ""When a rat had to decide whether a 1.6 seconds interval was shorter or longer than 1.5 seconds, we could see how the population clock stretched or shrunk in accordance with the decision of the animal,"" explains Thiago Gouv a, a doctoral student at the lab who also participated in this study. ""If the wave would move faster, then the neurons that are usually active during the later part of the wave would already be active at the time the second sound happens and the rat would decide the duration was long. However, the wave would frequently move slower, leading the rat to believe erroneously that the duration was short."" These results strongly indicate that the behavior of the rat may be driven by this population of neurons, which informs the animal how much time had passed, leading it to make corresponding decisions. ""This is the first time that the relation between the speed of the  neural population clock' and the duration judgments made by the subject has been demonstrated. The question now is how is this timing information generated and how is it precisely used to guide the behavior of the animal,"" concludes Dr. Paton. Finally, even though the rat was making mistakes when it had to make decisions about durations close to the boundary, the researchers ""don't think this means that the clock isn't perfect exactly... It is perhaps variable relative to the time our watch provides, but this might actually be an optimal representation of time for the organism."" JLM&A, SAGouv a TS et al.

Working with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, the University s Environment Department and Exeter School of Biosciences SimOmics is developing a pioneering  Virtual Fish EcoToxicology Laboratory"" that will mathematically model the exposure, uptake, metabolism and effects of future drugs on different species of fish before the drug is developed. The models will also enable scientists to prioritise legacy drugs lacking chronic fish toxicity data for definitive environmental impact assessments, in a cost effective manner that will also reduce the need for animal research. Regulations require that before authorisation, new active pharmaceutical ingredients must undergo an environmental risk assessment (ERA).The SimOmics  Evidence Bioscience  platform will be the first in the world that can accurately predict the end-to-end journey that drugs will take from the patient s body into wastewater and river systems, and even predict their effect on fish reproduction and growth. It may also have the potential to simulate the effect of future drugs on humans. In the UK alone, the chemical industry, including pharmaceutical firms, spends tens of millions of pounds each year conducting toxicology tests on fish. This new technology could reduce that cost by a third. Standard toxicology tests, involving a fish experiment, can take anything from a few days to one year to conduct, depending on its complexity and scope and the mode of action of the drug or chemical being tested. The SimOmics system could perform similar tests - using computer simulations - in just minutes. The transparent and evidence-based virtual laboratory will also generate a robust audit trail of data subsets from each test. This will enable companies to demonstrate that they have tested all active pharmaceutical ingredients to a high standard. AstraZeneca is contributing their expertise in target conservation, read across and environmental toxicology data to the project. SimOmics is also part of a consortium that recently secured almost  1m from the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) to develop a  virtual laboratory  to boost the search for new treatments for leishmaniasis, a tropical disease responsible for an estimated 30,000 deaths a year. And SimOmics recently developed a powerful web-based tool - the  SimOmics Evidence  platform   that will allow drug companies to submit new drug ingredients for  virtual drug trials  to help reduce R&D costs and refine drug development before animal tests and clinical trials. Professor Jon Timmis, CEO of SimOmics, said:  Our technology will dramatically de-risk the testing of drugs and their interactions with fish. We also see future applications for testing the environmental impact of everything from new pesticides to printing ink. Ultimately, we could also model the effect of future drugs on humans to ensure that new treatments are already refined and developed to a much higher standard - before the first clinical trials ever take place.

The findings also create a bit of molecular intrigue. It involves how cells used in the study   which still had the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair defect   were able to recover and grow normally after targeted treatment.  This study provides an experimental platform to test new therapies that could prevent pre- and post-natal Fanconi anemia conditions, which have no cure and limited treatment options,  said Susanne Wells, PhD, lead investigator and director of the Epithelial Carcinogenesis and Stem Cell Program in the Cincinnati Children s Hospital Medical Center (Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute).  Our findings also raise a number of important questions, so there is a lot more to be done.  In the study, researchers used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can become any cell type in the body. The induced stem cells   reprogrammed from mature skin and connective tissue cells donated by Fanconi anemia patients   had the defective (FA) DNA repair pathway, which normally helps protect the genome from mutations. Scientists closely studied the stem cells in laboratory cultures and cells injected into humanized mouse models   monitoring their genetic, molecular and developmental progression. Even with defective FA DNA repair, the stem cells retained their ability to transform into different tissues. Humanized mice injected with the defective cells even started to form teratomas   benign tumors that contain a haphazard mishmash of cells and tissues of different organ systems. But researchers said the DNA repair defect started to kill off the pluripotent stem cells by blocking cell division and causing programmed cell death. The authors then noticed an enzyme that serves as a DNA regulatory checkpoint during cell division (CHK1) was behaving hyperactively in the stem cells, which hastened their death. The researchers used existing pharmacologic inhibitors of CHK1 to block the hyperactive enzyme at a critical stage of the stem cell cycle. This allowed them to override what usually are unfixable errors in the FA repair pathway. After targeted treatment, FA-pathway-deficient pluripotent stem cells resumed dividing and expanding normally. Researchers said much to their surprise, the resumption of cell growth occurred without what they had expected to be massive chromosome abnormalities. Because of this, the scientists speculate that a compensating DNA repair process is engaged in the reinvigorated cells. Because this unidentified repair process may also rescue the DNA repair defect in the different tissues types affected by Fanconi anemia, Wells and colleagues believe their study may point to an approach that treats all clinical manifestations of the disease   including anemia and cancer.  A key question for us is what type of DNA repair kicks in under these conditions   and is it error free or error prone?  explained Wells.  A novel mode of emergency DNA repair might indeed be discovered in the iPSC cells. We believe some type of compensatory DNA repair must be driven by CHK1 inhibition when cells have FA pathway loss, otherwise the cells would have died off very quickly.  Human cells have other DNA repair processes besides the FA repair pathway. Researchers will closely monitor their upcoming experiments for one of these existing DNA repair pathways. Members of the research team, including study first author Timothy Chlon, PhD (a research associate in the Wells laboratory) stressed the current results are early and require extensive additional study before becoming clinically relevant.  Researchers plan to follow up this study with additional testing in  humanized  and genetic mouse models. They will attempt to improve embryonic development and post-birth fitness in FA-pathway deficient mice with timed application of the CHK1 inhibitor. The authors will closely monitor the mice as they age and use genetic sequencing to screen for disease-causing gene mutations. They also will take advantage of the prolonged monitoring period to look for evidence of a DNA repair process (either novel or existing) in the FA-deficient mice.","Published: January 14, 2016"

Advances in cellular biology have yielded popular and powerful tools to detect cellular proteins and DNA -- largely by exploiting the unique and intricate interactions between these microscopic molecules. Scientists use these tools to advance research and diagnose diseases. But these come at a cost in time -- from hours to days -- before they yield accurate answers. Three scientists at the University of Washington have proposed a way to speed up this waiting game. Their solution, reminiscent of the magic behind washing machines, could reduce wait times to a fraction of what they once were. As they have recently reported, biological assays that once took hours could instead take minutes. ""These are very common assays,"" said Xiaohu Gao, a UW professor of bioengineering and senior author on the paper. ""Most scientists were willing to wait hours and hours because they had no choice.""Many of today's biological assays use molecules such as antibodies to detect specific types of cellular proteins or pieces of DNA. These ""detector molecules"" only bind to specific targets, such as a certain class of cellular proteins, and include additional components such as nanoparticles or dye molecules to emit light if they successfully bind. These assays have revealed where different proteins are found in cells and helped diagnose diseases. But these tests take hours or days to complete. The detector molecules, suspended in a fluid, float around while their targets -- whether cellular proteins or pieces of DNA -- are adhered to the hard, flat surface of a small plate or petri dish. While bulky detector molecules close to the surface can easily find and bind to their targets, molecules further up in the fluid column move slowly due to their size. It can take hours for enough detector molecules to diffuse down and bind to their targets to produce a visible color change. ""We call this 'diffusion limitation,' and it's a serious problem since both the antibody and nanoparticles are so large,"" said Gao. ""People have proposed solutions -- like stirring or gently rocking a reaction plate to mix the solution. But when we tested this we saw that stirring and rocking only improved the reaction time by 3 to 5 percent. That's not enough."" Gao and his team were prompted to tackle the problem of diffusion limitation after they developed a new staining assay but its long reaction times made their protocol impractical. Inspired by studies of fluid dynamics, they decided to work around the problem of diffusion limitation. Instead of waiting for detector molecules to drift down to the surface of the plate, they simply allowed detector molecules close to the surface to bind. Then, they drained the solution from the plate, mixed it, put it back on the plate and repeated this cycle dozens of times -- which they call cyclic solution draining and replenishing. ""In a washing machine, you squeeze water out and put it back in,"" said Gao. ""Dry and re-soak. Dry and re-soak. This is exactly the same mechanism: Drain the fluid completely and then put it back on the plate. That's much more efficient than simply stirring it around."" To drain fluid from the plate, they covered the plate with a seal and inverted it. To ""re-soak,"" they flipped the plate upright again. The flipping action helped mix the detector molecules in the fluid, which sped up the total reaction time. They tested cyclic solution draining and replenishing with two types of antibody staining techniques, ELISA and immunofluorescence microscopy. Reaction times for both were cut substantially with this drain and re-soak approach. In one case, what was once a one-hour incubation time was cut to just seven minutes. Though sealing and flipping the plate, which they accomplished mechanically, might be impractical for other tests, there are other ways to ""drain"" a plate. ""We used gravity because we wanted to show that draining would work,"" said Gao. ""But you could use air bubbles or centrifugation to drain as well, for example. There are lots of possibilities."" If so, this simple work-around for the problem of diffusion limitation could slash waiting times for experiments. This would also impact other fields, reducing the wait times for medical test results to come back or speed up chemical engineering protocols. ""Really, this was a common problem that no one before had made a link to. But here we have, and it's so simple,"" said Gao. ""When we prepare tea, we don't let it sit there or shake the cup. We repeatedly lift, drain the tea bag, then lower it into the hot water. That's what we've done here.""","Published: January 14, 2016"

We have now found a way to identify the right type of stem cells that create heart cells that successfully engraft when transplanted and generate muscle tissue in the heart, which means we re one step closer to developing cell-based therapies for people living with heart disease.  The method is still years away from being tested in humans, but the findings are a significant step forward in the use of human embryonic stem cells for heart regeneration. The research team used human embryonic stem cells, which are capable of turning into any cell in the body, to create cardiac mesoderm cells. Cardiac mesoderm cells have some stem cell characteristics, but only generate specific cell types found in the heart.  The researchers pinpointed two distinct markers on cardiac mesoderm cells that specifically create heart muscle tissue and supporting vessels. They then transplanted these cells into an animal model and found that a significant number of the cells survived, integrated and produced cardiac cells, resulting in the regeneration of heart muscle and vessels.  Dr. Reza Ardehali Ardehali, who is both a physician and a scientist, treats patients with advanced heart disease and also studies ways to cure or reverse heart disease. His goal is to one day be able to develop regenerative heart cells from stem cells and then transplant them into the heart through a minimally invasive procedure, replacing scar tissue and restoring heart function. Another study recently published by Ardehali and his team helps further this goal by outlining a novel approach to image, label and track transplanted cells in the heart using MRI, a common and non-invasive imaging technique. That study, which was published in the journal Stem Cells Translational Medicine, used specialized particles that are easily identified using an MRI. The labeling approach allowed Ardehali and his team to track cells in an animal model for up to 40 days after transplantation.  The first author on both studies was Rhys Skelton, who was a visiting graduate student in Ardehali s lab when he completed the research. Skelton has since completed his studies at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute in Australia and received a Ph.D. from the University of Melbourne. He plans to return to UCLA as a postdoctoral scholar to continue his research on human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiac cells with the hope of one day developing a cell-based therapy for heart disease patients in need.  Our findings show, for the first time, that specific markers can be used to isolate the right kind of early heart cells for transplantation,  said David Elliott, a co-author of both studies, leader of the cardiac development research group at the Murdoch Institute and  Skelton s doctoral supervisor.  Furthermore, our cell labeling and tracking approach allows us to determine the viability and location of transplanted cells. ","Published: January 14, 2016"

The findings, made in mice, are a significant step toward immunotherapies that are effective against all strains of Ebola virus that cause human disease.  ""A broadly effective immunotherapy for Ebola virus would be a tremendous advance, since it's impossible to predict which strain of the virus will cause the next outbreak,"" said study co-leader Jonathan Lai, Ph.D., associate professor of biochemistry at Einstein. The other study co-leader is John M. Dye, Ph.D., branch chief of viral immunology at USAMRIID. Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV) was responsible for the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the largest in history. The next-most pathogenic strain of Ebola virus is Sudan Ebola virus (SUDV). ""This strain is also a concern because outbreaks are occurring more frequently, and it has been responsible for large outbreaks in the past,"" said Dr. Dye. Although a Zaire-specific vaccine is in clinical trials, no vaccine has yet been approved for preventing infection from any strain of Ebola virus. And therapies for people who become infected are very limited. ZMapp, a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies, is the most promising of several experimental immunotherapies for Ebola virus now in development. But ZMapp's antibodies are specific for EBOV and would not work against the other two Ebola strains that have caused major outbreaks. (In addition to Zaire and Sudan, the third major strain is Bundibugyo.) In previous work, Dr. Lai and his colleagues used a technique called synthetic antibody engineering to create the first humanized antibodies against SUDV. Those antibodies were designed to bind to SUDV's surface glycoprotein, which the virus uses to gain entry into host cells. Since SUDV's glycoprotein shares just 55 percent of amino acid sequences found in EBOV's glycoprotein, antibodies against SUDV do not neutralize EBOV. In the current study, Dr. Lai's team engineered ""bispecific"" antibodies that contain key glycoprotein-binding sequences from both the EBOV and SUDV antibodies. The bispecific antibodies effectively neutralized both EBOV and SUDV in tissue culture studies. In addition, the antibodies provided high levels of protection for mice that had been exposed to lethal doses of either of the viruses. The bispecific antibodies must still be tested in larger animals and in humans to know whether they'll be effective. If the new immunotherapy proves safe and effective for people, said Dr. Lai, it might best be suited for preventing local outbreaks from getting out of hand, as happened in the recent West Africa Ebola virus epidemic. ""It's also possible,"" he noted, ""that a therapy like this could be used prophylactically, to protect health workers or family members who come into contact with Ebola virus patients."" There are currently no plans to further test the new immunotherapy. But if a pharmaceutical company were interested, said Dr. Lai, ""it could probably move the antibody fairly rapidly along the evaluation process."" Meanwhile, Dr. Lai has broadened his approach to Ebola virus therapy. He is developing antibodies and antibody cocktails aimed at neutralizing the three most dangerous Ebola virus species (Zaire, Sudan and Bundibugyo) as well as Marburg virus, a deadly pathogen closely related to Ebola virus.","Published: January 14, 2016"

The collaboration builds on the existing partnership between the two organizations formed in 2014 and leverages MedImmune s local presence in Mountain View, CA. Scientists from both organizations will partner to explore the disease biology and the core underlying mechanisms that drive areas of unmet medical need in RIA, such as the microbiome and regenerative medicine. The work will include extensive profiling of patient samples to expand understanding of disease progression; to identify novel biomarkers; and, to create a quantative framework to understand the effect of these biomarkers on clinical trial outcomes.  This partnership brings together the complementary strengths of UCSF and MedImmune and will foster closer engagement between both groups,  said June Lee, MD, Director, Early Translational Research and the Catalyst Program at UCSF, who is overseeing the partnership.  Ultimately, these collaborations will accelerate research to better understand diseases with limited treatment options, and will hopefully have significant impact.  This partnership will include seven initial research projects over the next three years, with the potential for more projects to be included in the future. These projects will focus on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), scleroderma, sarcoidosis, severe asthma and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  We look forward to extending our existing partnership with world-renowned scientists at UCSF, an institution committed to advancing translational research,  said Dr. Bing Yao, Senior Vice President and Head of MedImmune s Respiratory, Inflammation and Autoimmunity Innovative Medicines Unit.  Combined with MedImmune s innovative, cutting-edge science in respiratory, inflammation and autoimmunity as well as translational medicine, we are optimistic our collective findings will benefit the patients who are most in need.  There are significant gaps in the understanding of how these diseases progress and whether distinct patient subtypes are more amenable to current or experimental therapies. Moreover, many of these diseases are increasing in incidence, resulting in an even greater impact on health. This extensive research program will lay the groundwork for ongoing drug discovery and development aimed at identifying new medicines for the millions of patients living with these conditions who currently lack sufficient treatment options. Developing techniques to quantify the impact of predictive biomarkers on clinical outcomes data will help further advance the ultimate aim of precision medicine in these disease areas.","Published: January 14, 2016"

Under the terms of the agreement, which combines the scientific and technical expertise of both companies, HemoShear will leverage its proprietary discovery platform, REVEAL-Tx , with the aim of developing a predictive model for preclinical drug-induced vascular injury (DIVI). Financial terms were not disclosed. The initial stage of the collaboration between HemoShear and Pfizer was designed to assess the repeatability of vascular toxicities of a specifically chosen set of drugs in HemoShear s REVEAL-Tx  platform. In this next stage, the companies will use HemoShear s platform to assess a large number of compounds with the aim of building a predictive computational model that would be used for evaluation of vascular safety of Pfizer drug compounds before entering pre-clinical stages of development.  Drug toxicity discovered in pre-clinical or clinical trials has serious implications for drug development,  said Jim Powers, Chief Executive Officer at HemoShear.  Our collaboration has the potential to create a new safety paradigm for the pharmaceutical industry that improves confidence in selecting safer drug candidates for pre-clinical trials, and we look forward to working with Pfizer to further develop this much needed, predictive model.  DIVI poses a safety dilemma for the pharmaceutical industry because of limitations in resolving the underlying drivers of vascular injury. In addition, there are no generally accepted diagnostic or predictive biomarkers to understand when or why DIVI will occur, nor are there models to select the safest compound prior to animal testing. If drug toxicity occurs in an animal, significant program delays and additional costs are incurred to investigate and explain the underlying biology and determine whether the compound is safe to move forward to human testing, or to determine if another compound would be safer. In some cases, decisions are made to stop a program altogether in the absence of a clear understanding of the injury and whether an animal response translates to human clinical outcomes. In addition to leveraging REVEAL-Tx  for safety and drug discovery collaborations with pharmaceutical companies, HemoShear Therapeutics is pursuing its own drug discovery programs in metabolic diseases with high unmet need.","Published: January 14, 2016"

This emotional instability leaves such individuals vulnerable to emotional upheaval that puts them at risk for problem behaviors, including self-destructive acts and impulsive aggression. A new study in Biological Psychiatry provides a quantitative summary of the brain abnormalities that may be underlying the emotional upheaval patients with BPD experience daily. See Also: Yin and yang of serotonin neurons in mood regulation Dr Lars Schulze at Freie Universit t Berlin and his colleagues at Heidelberg University focused on emotional processing in this meta-analysis to investigate the related functional and structural abnormalities in patients with borderline personality disorder. They pooled functional data from 19 published studies, providing a total of 281 patients with BPD and 293 healthy control subjects. Structural data was available for 10 studies, with a total of 263 patients with BPD and 278 healthy subjects. Their analyses revealed that during the processing of negative emotions, BPD patients show enhanced activations of the left amygdala along with blunted responses of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to healthy controls. These brain regions were also found to overlap with abnormalities in gray matter volume. ""Our results highlight brain abnormalities in the amygdala and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,"" said Schulze. ""The amygdala is known to process emotional arousal and is hyperactive in BPD. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which has a key role in the regulation of emotions, is less active during the processing of negative emotional stimuli in BPD."" ""In order to understand these findings, it might be useful to imagine that the brain was a like a car,"" explains Dr John Krystal, Editor of Biological Psychiatry. ""The gas pedal for emotion might be the amygdala and the emotional brake might be the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The current findings seem to suggest that, in borderline personality disorder, the brain steps on the gas yet does not as effectively brake emotion."" Together, these findings support the concept of borderline personality disorder as a disorder of emotion dysregulation. Treatment options that can help fine-tune the brain's 'motor' may help alleviate some of the distressing clinical symptoms that individuals with BPD experience and grapple with on a daily basis.

However, if too many of these components pile up, or if their usual ratio is disrupted, that can be deadly for the cell. A new study from MIT chemists sheds light on a longstanding puzzle: how a single enzyme known as ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) generates all four of these building blocks and maintains the correct balance among them. Unlike RNR, most enzymes specialize in converting just one type of molecule to another, says Catherine Drennan, a professor of chemistry and biology at MIT.  Ribonucleotide reductase is very unusual. I ve been fascinated with this question of how it actually works and how this enzyme s active site can be molded into four different shapes.  Drennan and colleagues report that RNR s interactions with its downstream products via a special effector site causes the enzyme to change its shape, determining which of the four DNA building blocks it will generate. While many other enzymes are controlled by effectors, this type of regulation usually turns enzyme activity up or down.  I can t think of any other examples of effector binding changing what the substrate is. This is just very unusual,  Drennan says. The paper s lead author is former MIT graduate student Christina Zimanyi. Other authors are graduate students Percival Yang-Ting Chen and Gyunghoon Kang, and former graduate student Michael Funk. Closing the latch Deoxyribonucleotides are generated from ribonucleotides, which are the building blocks for RNAs   molecules that perform many important roles in gene expression. RNR, which catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, is an evolutionarily ancient enzyme that may have been responsible for the conversion of the earliest life forms, which were based on RNA, into DNA-based organisms, Drennan says.  There s no other enzyme that really can do that chemistry,  she says.  It s the only one, and it s very different than most enzymes and has a lot of really unusual features.  Previous studies have shown that RNR can take on different shapes, but it wasn t clear how those changes in configuration contributed to its specificity. In the new study, the MIT team took X-ray crystallographic images of the enzyme as it interacted with all four ribonucleotide substrates, allowing the researchers to determine how its structure changes. They found that the enzyme s active site   the region that binds the substrate   changes shape depending on which effector molecule is bound to a distant site on the enzyme. For this enzyme, the effector molecules are deoxynucleoside trisphosphates such as deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) or thymidine triphosphate (TTP). Depending on which of these effectors is bound to the distant regulatory site, the active site can accommodate one of the four ribounucleotide substrates. Effector binding promotes closing of part of the protein over the active site like a latch to lock in the substrate. If the wrong base is in the active site, the latch can t close and the substrate will diffuse out.  It s exquisitely designed so that if you have the wrong substrate in there, you can t close up the active site,  Drennan says.  It s a really elegant set of movements that allows for this kind of molecular screening process.  The effectors can also shut off production completely, by binding to a completely different site on the enzyme, if the pool of building blocks is getting too big.  This study is a true tour-de-force since so many of the questions regarding activation and specificity are answered. Having high-resolution structures for all of the pairs of substrates and effectors is a terrific achievement,  says Wilfred van der Donk, a professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who was not involved in the research. Targeting DNA production Because cancer cells need a large pool of DNA building blocks, scientists are interested in RNR as a target for chemotherapy drugs. There is now a handful of FDA-approved cancer drugs that interfere with RNR and thus deplete the deoxynucleotide pool, but the new findings may help researchers to design better RNR-targeting drugs, Drennan says.  It makes it now possible to think about doing more rational drug design than was possible before,  Drennan says. RNR could also make a good target for antibacterial or antiviral drugs, she says, but for that to work, researchers would have to ensure that the drugs would not also target the human version of RNR. In this study Drennan focused on RNR from E. coli, but she is now investigating the human form of the enzyme.  My lab is interested in studying both human and bacterial RNRs, because I feel like we really need to understand whether they all work the same way, or whether there are going to be differences,  she says.","Published: January 13, 2016"

With a bacterial disease -- much like cancer -- if you understand how the virulent form spreads, you can better control or remove it,   said Abhaya Dandekar, a professor of plant sciences and senior author on the study.   We anticipate that this discovery could open new ways to think about dealing with Pierce s disease and highlight other areas of immune response, in general, that haven t yet been considered,  he said. About Pierce s disease Pierce s disease, first identified in the 1890s, is caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa and is characterized by yellowed and browning leaves that eventually drop from the vine. The disease is transmitted from vine to vine by small, winged insects called sharpshooters. Pierce s disease is established in Northern California, where it is transmitted by the blue-green sharpshooter, which lives near rivers and streams. The disease became a serious threat to California agriculture in 1996 when the glassywinged sharpshooter -- another Pierce s disease carrier native to the Southwest -- was discovered in the Temecula Valley of Southern California. How infection progresses It s been known for a number of years that when Xyllela fastidiosa invades a grapevine, it produces a biofilm or gel in the xylem -- the vascular tissue that transports water and some nutrients throughout the vine. Scientists have theorized that this biofilm damages the vine by clogging up the xylem, preventing the flow of water to the leaves. That theory seemed to explain the yellowing of the leaf edges and eventual death of the leaf tissue. But not all of the evidence stacked up to fit that theory, Dandekar said. For example a heavy accumulation of Xyllela fastidiosa in grapevine leaves was not always accompanied by severe disease symptoms in leaves. And, in some infected grapevines as well as other host plants, the leaves showed severe symptoms but the xylem had very little blockage. So Dandekar and colleagues set out to investigate an alternative mechanism by which Xyllela fastidiosa might be wreaking havoc with the vine s physiology. Secrets of the  secretome  The research team began by analyzing the bacteria s secretome -- the entire collection of enzymes and other proteins secreted by a disease-causing agent like Xyllela fastidiosa during the infection process. Such secreted proteins are known to play key roles in triggering many plant diseases. The resulting data indicated that an enzyme, which the researchers named LesA, was quite abundant during Xyllela fastidiosa infections and shared characteristics with similar enzymes known to be capable of breaking down plant cell walls.  The researchers went on to confirm their suspicions by demonstrating that a mutant strain of Xyllela fastidiosa bacteria -- with a specific gene knocked out, or inactivated -- lacked the ability to cause infection in grapevines.  The LesA enzyme has the ability to move through cell membranes, equipping the Xyllela fastidiosa bacteria to invade the grapevine and to live in its xylem tissues, where it feeds on fatlike compounds called lipids,  Dandekar says. In this way, the LesA enzyme triggers the process that causes the typical Pierce s disease leaf damage -- a process completely unrelated to the xylem blockage and water stress that had previously been thought to cause the symptomatic leaf damage.","Published: January 13, 2016"

Until now, their function in a live animal was unknown. A team led by University of Wisconsin Madison medical geneticist Xin Sun reports that PNECs are effective sensors seeded in the airway of many animals, including humans.  These cells make up less than one percent of the cells in the airway epithelium,  the layer of cells that lines the respiratory tract, explains Sun.  Our conclusion is that they are capable of receiving, interpreting and responding to environmental stimuli such as allergens or chemicals mixed with the air we breathe.  Discovering the function of the cells may provide new therapeutic avenues for a wide range of serious diseases of the pulmonary system. Sun and her group initially set out to find the underlying cause of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), a fairly common birth defect where a hole in a newborn s diaphragm, the muscle that controls breathing, lets organs from the abdomen slip into the chest. The deformed diaphragm can be repaired surgically, but many of the babies still die. Those that survive can have symptoms similar to asthma or pulmonary hypertension. The Wisconsin group homed in on a pair of genes known as ROBO1 and ROBO2. Mutations in the genes had previously been implicated in CDH. By knocking out ROBO genes in mice, Sun and her colleagues were able to mimic CDH. Unexpectedly, they also discovered that PNECs were disorganized in the ROBO mutants. In a healthy mouse, PNECs mostly form clusters of cells.  In the mutant, they don t cluster,  says Sun.  They stay as solitary cells, and as single cells they are much more sensitive to the environment.  The team went on to show that defects in the PNECs caused the hyperactive immune response in the ROBO mutant lungs. PNECs are the only known cells in the airway lining that are linked to the nervous system. It seems, explains Sun, that they are basically distributed sensors, gathering information from the air and relaying it to the brain. Interestingly, the same cells also receive processed signals back from the brain to amp up their secretion of neuropeptides, which are small protein molecules that are potent regulators of the immune response. Disorders of the immune system like asthma are associated with increased expression of neuropeptides. Showing that PNECs play a role in regulating host response through the release of neuropeptides suggests that it may be possible to devise ways of regulating them to prevent or ameliorate disease, Sun says.","Published: January 13, 2016"

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/increasing-drug-efficacy-and-reducing-side-effects-198096,Increasing Drug Efficacy and Reducing Side Effects Researchers have developed a speedy  controllable way to get two or more ingredients into the same tiny capsule and only have them mix when triggered by a signal like vibrations or heat  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Chemotherapy often comes with powerful side effects, and one of the reasons for this is that the drugs used to kill cancer cells can also damage other fast-growing cells in the body, like hair follicles. But one possibility for reducing these side effects may be if the chemotherapy drugs only become toxic when they reach the tumor. The search for such targeted drug delivery options for chemotherapy and other treatments inspired a team of researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China and The Ohio State University to develop a new way to package two or more ingredients into a single capsule. If the ingredients must be mixed for the drug to work, doctors could trigger the mixing in targeted area of the body, boosting drug efficiency while reducing side effects. The researchers report their method for multi-ingredient encapsulation and triggered mixing in a new paper. While the work has shown promise because it allows the researcher to produce micro capsules, they have not yet used the technique to encapsulate cancer treatments. If such capsules can be made, they will have to prove safe and effective in clinical trials before becoming widely available to treat cancer. ""One of the limitations of chemotherapy is that less than 5 percent of the drugs typically get to the tumor, while the rest can be absorbed by other organs,"" said Ronald Xu, a professor in biomedical engineering at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. One possible way to address the problem could be to make the drugs non-toxic when injected into the body and trigger mixing that would produce a toxic product only near the tumor site. For such drugs to work on a large scale, there must be a way to quickly, controllably, and cost-effectively produce capsules with two or more active ingredients. If the drugs are to be injected and spread through the body via the bloodstream, the capsules should also be small. Xu and his colleagues from the University of Science and Technology of China developed a device that can produce tiny capsules approximately 100 microns across (about the size of a speck of dust) with multiple inner ingredients. Ting Si, the first author on the paper and an expert in fluid mechanics, also developed mathematical models that show the relationship between process parameters, like flow rate and needle diameter, and the size of the final capsules. The models were used to achieve the designated capsule sizes. The device works by funneling different ingredients through two inner needles. The inner needles run parallel to each other and are both enclosed in a larger outer needle, which contains an ingredient for making the outer shell of the capsule. As all the ingredients exit the needles through a single nozzle, a high-speed gas forces the liquids into a narrow stream that breaks up into individual droplets. An electric field stabilizes the flow so that uniform droplets are created. Depending on the relative flow rates, each droplet may contain two or more smaller inner droplets made from the ingredients in the inner needles. The researchers tested their device with colored paraffin wax - red in one needle and blue in the other. The outer shell was made from sodium alginate - a material extracted from seaweed that turned gelatinous when the droplets fell into a calcium chloride solution. Depending on the experimental conditions, the team was able to produce between 1,000 to 100,000 capsules per second, and nearly 100 percent of the inner liquids were incorporated into the capsules without any waste. Once encapsulated, the two colors of wax did not mix, because of surface tension, but the team demonstrated that they could force the red and blue wax to merge by vibrating the capsules. The team also demonstrated that they could release the inner droplets by dissolving the outer shell. The key features of the new device are its high efficiency and yield, and the fact that the size of the droplets can be uniformly controlled, Xu said. By further fine-tuning the device's operation Xu predicts that the team could make capsules that are 3-5 microns across, about the size of a red blood cell. The process can also be easily scaled up by building an array of nozzles and could be modified to encapsulate 3 or more active ingredients by adding additional inner needles. While Xu and his colleagues were motivated by drug delivery, their device might also find wider use in a range of applications that require controlled reactions, such as regenerative medicine, and nuclear and chemical engineering, Xu said.","Published: January 13, 2016"

Intestinal gases have been linked to colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but their role in health is poorly understood and there is currently no easy and reliable tool for detecting them inside the gut. The first animal trials of smart gas sensing pills developed at Australia's RMIT University - which can send data from inside the gut directly to a mobile phone - have examined the impact of low and high-fibre diets on intestinal gases and offer new clues for the development of treatments for gut disorders. Lead investigator Professor Kourosh Kalantar-zadeh, from the Centre for Advanced Electronics and Sensors at RMIT, said the results reversed current assumptions about the effect of fibre on the gut. ""We found a low-fibre diet produced four times more hydrogen in the small intestine than a high-fibre diet,"" Kalantar-zadeh said. ""This was a complete surprise because hydrogen is produced through fermentation, so we naturally expected more fibre would equal more of this fermentation gas. ""The smart pills allow us to identify precisely where the gases are produced and help us understand the microbial activity in these areas - it's the first step in demolishing the myths of food effects on our body and replacing those myths with hard facts. ""We hope this technology will in future enable researchers to design personalised diets or drugs that can efficiently target problem areas in the gut, to help the millions of people worldwide that are affected by digestive disorders and diseases."" The trials revealed different levels of fibre in a diet affected both how much gas was produced and where it was concentrated in the gut - in the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. The smart pills were trialled on two groups of pigs - whose digestive systems are similar to humans - fed high and low-fibre diets. The results indicate the technology could help doctors differentiate gut disorders such as IBS, showing:   high-fibre diets produce more methane gas in the large intestine than the low-fibre diet, suggesting that painful gut gas retention could be avoided by cutting back on high-fibre food   low-fibre diets produced four times more hydrogen gas in the small intestine than high-fibre, indicating a high-fibre regimen could be better for patients with IBS caused by bacterial overgrowth in small intestine   the ratio of carbon dioxide and methane gases remained the same in the large intestine for both diets, suggesting that neither diet would be helpful for people suffering IBS diseases associated with excess methane concentration","Published: January 13, 2016"

We ve identified two steps in that staircase.  In the paper, the researchers detail how they have been able to fingerprint myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a state for blood cells that turns into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cancer in approximately 30% of patients. The study demonstrates that early and accurate prediction of this aggressive cancer is possible. AML is the most common type of leukemia in adults, and about 1,300 Canadians are expected to develop the disease each year. Bhatia s research team found when they deleted one version of the important GSK-3 gene, the other version of the gene became active but remained non-cancerous. However, when the second version of the gene was also deleted, AML cancer began. To test this, Bhatia s team collaborated with Italian researchers at the University of Bologna to apply these initial findings to human blood samples that had been previously collected from patients with MDS, some of whom eventually developed AML. McMaster researchers did a retroactive study, and demonstrated that gene expression analysis of patient blood samples was accurate in predicting which patients would develop AML and which would not.  This discovery improves our ability to identify which patients with MDS will develop AML,  said Bhatia.  However, our next step is to go beyond better predictive measures for the development of a blood cancer, and use this predictive gene expression as a target for drugs to prevent AML from developing altogether. This will be part of a new era of genetic-based drug discovery.

Published online, the study s findings have future implications for improving immune function in the elderly, for obesity, and for illnesses such as cancer and type-2 diabetes. When functioning normally, the thymus produces new T cells for the immune system, but with age, the thymus becomes fatty and loses its ability to produce new T cells. This loss of new T cells in the body is one cause of increased risk of infections and certain cancers in the elderly. Led by Vishwa Deep Dixit, professor of comparative medicine and immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine, the researchers studied transgenic mice with elevated levels of FGF21. The team knocked out the gene s function and studied the impact of decreasing levels of FGF21 on the immune system. They found that increasing the levels of FGF21 in old mice protected the thymus from age-related fatty degeneration and increased the ability of the thymus to produce new T cells, while FGF21 deficiency accelerated the degeneration of the thymus in old mice.  We found that FGF21 levels in thymic epithelial cells is several fold higher than in the liver   therefore FGF21 acts within the thymus to promote T cell production,  said Dixit.  Elevating the levels of FGF21 in the elderly or in cancer patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation may be an additional strategy to increase T cell production, and thus bolster immune function,  said Dixit. Dixit added that FGF21 is produced in the liver as an endocrine hormone. Its levels increase when calories are restricted to allow fats to be burned when glucose levels are low. FGF21 is a metabolic hormone that improves insulin sensitivity and also induces weight loss; therefore it is being studied for its therapeutic effects in type-2 diabetes and obesity. Dixit said further studies will focus on understanding how FGF21 protects the thymus from aging, and whether elevating FGF21 pharmacologically can extend the human healthspan and lower the incidence of disease caused by age-related loss of immune function.  We will also look to developing a way to mimic calorie restriction to enhance immune function without actually reducing caloric intake. ","Published: January 13, 2016"

The study is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. BL-8040, BioLineRx's lead oncology platform, is a CXCR4 antagonist that has been shown in several clinical trials to be a robust mobilizer of immune cells and to be effective at inducing direct tumor cell death. Additional findings in the field of immuno-oncology suggest that CXCR4 antagonists may be effective in inducing the migration of anti-tumor T cells into the tumor micro-environment. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T- lymphocytes, which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. The Phase 2 study will evaluate the clinical response, safety and tolerability of the combination of these therapies as well as multiple pharmacodynamic parameters, including the ability to improve infiltration of T cells into the tumor and their reactivity. ""We are extremely happy to collaborate with MSD, a pioneer and world leader in cancer immunotherapy. This marks the entrance of BL-8040 into this exciting field, which is already transforming the lives of many cancer patients,"" stated Dr. Kinneret Savitsky, Chief Executive Officer of BioLineRx. ""Because certain tumors exhibit only a modest response to existing immunotherapies, we are increasingly seeing clinical studies involving combinations of immuno-oncology agents with other classes of drugs. We are initiating this study with the hope that it will show that the combination of BL-8040 with KEYTRUDA has the potential to expand the benefit of immunotherapy to cancer types currently resistant to immuno-oncology treatments, such as pancreatic cancer, which represents a significant unmet medical need. If this potential can be realized, it will be an extremely important advance in the fight against cancer, as well as a seminal milestone for BioLineRx."" ""Today, there is a great opportunity and need to bring forward new scientific breakthroughs for the treatment of pancreatic cancer,"" said Dr. Eric Rubin, vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology early-stage development, MSD Research Laboratories. ""Evaluating the potential of combination therapies through strategic collaborations in difficult-to-treat tumor types continues to be an important part of our immuno-oncology clinical development program for KEYTRUDA."" The agreement is between BioLineRx and MSD, through a subsidiary. Per the terms of the agreement, the trial will be sponsored and performed by BioLineRx. The study is planned to commence by mid-2016. Upon completion of the study, or at any earlier point, both parties will have the option to expand the collaboration to include a pivotal registration study.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/parallel-singlecell-profiling-204754,Parallel Single Cell Profiling New single cell genomics protocol allows researchers to study links between DNA modifications  methylation  and the activity of a gene  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A new method developed by researchers in the UK and Belgium makes it possible to study the epigenome and transcriptome of a single cell at the same time. The protocol helps scientists pinpoint the relationship between changes in DNA methylation and gene expression. Single-cell sequencing technology has progressed rapidly in recent years, and is widely used to study how gene expression profiles ( transcriptomes ) vary between cells. Recent single-cell protocols also allow researchers to explore chemical modification of DNA ( epigenetics ), for example DNA methylation, which is a driving force behind changes to gene expression. Until now, it has only been possible to study single-cell transcriptomes and epigenomes separately.  This new experimental protocol lets you assay both DNA methylation and RNA of the same single cell in parallel,  says Oliver Stegle of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).  Our approach provides the first direct view on the relationship between heterogeneity in DNA methylation and variation of expression in specific genes across single cells. This new method combines our previously developed protocol for parallel DNA and RNA sequencing with new advances in single-cell epigenetics,  explains says Thierry Voet of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium.  The result is an optimised approach that maximises the amount of biological information that can be obtained from a single cell.  To test the method, the group used mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) at a stage when they switch continuously between different gene-expression states. Just as in the cells of an early stage embryo, the identity of these cells is fluid rather than fixed. The researchers used two techniques in parallel: one that reveals detailed information about expression (how much variation there is, where that heterogeneity is coming from) and one to study DNA methylation in the same cells. For each cell, they obtained sufficient coverage to study epigenetic and transcriptome diversity of several thousand genes.  The epigenetic state of ESCs is highly variable, and this variation is associated with changes in gene expression,  explains Wolf Reik of the Babraham Institute and Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.  Much of the transcriptional variability we see is thought to be driven by modifications of DNA, but now we have a technique that allows us to look at a single cell and discover relationships between DNA methylation and gene expression that were previously unknown. To understand development, it is really important that we pin these relationships down, and get them right.   Our statistical approach revealed hundreds of individual associations between variable epigenetic regions and gene expression,  adds Christof Angermueller of EMBL-EBI.  These associations can provide important insights into how pluripotency is maintained and how cell differentiation is regulated.  Going forward, the researchers expect the new protocol to offer new opportunities to study multiple different molecular layers simultaneously. This will go a long way towards understanding the connection between gene expression and DNA methylation in single cells, and identifying the factors that influence this relationship. Such research has implications for understanding normal development, and changes that occur with ageing and cancer. The method was developed within the Sanger Institute/EMBL-EBI Single Cell Genomics Centre, a collaborative effort to develop single-cell technologies and apply them to new biological questions.","Published: January 13, 2016"

""We've found that the inherent flexibility of the immune system is even more complex than previously understood,"" said Kenneth Oestreich, senior author of the paper and an assistant professor at the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute. At the first hint of a viral or bacterial invasion, the immune system launches an orchestrated front-line defense. If infection manages to take hold, the immune system creates specialized cells to combat the specific invading pathogen. These cells, known as effector cells, encounter and begin to destroy the specific pathogen. Once the infection has been eliminated, some of those cells linger in the body to become memory cells in the immune system. If the host becomes re-infected with the same bug, the immune system will recognize and quickly respond with a targeted attack. ""That's the basis of vaccine-mediated immunity,"" said Paul McDonald, a research scientist at the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute and first author on the paper. ""But how these memory cells arise after an infection has always been a bit of a mystery. Our study suggests that these important cells may arise directly from the effector population."" In this study, the researchers learned that proteins responding to the cells' environment are able to influence the memory gene program. The environment can actually push the effector cells towards memory. ""It was once believed that effector and memory cells arose as two distinct populations, with some cells initially fated to be effector type and some to be memory,"" McDonald said. ""We've now seen that there is much more fluidity between the cell types than originally thought."" The presence of certain proteins can influence the cell's fate. Interleukin-2, for instance, is a highly inflammatory protein produced at the start of an infection. Interleukin-2 levels remain high until the infection is under control. As the interleukin-2 levels drop, effector cells can turn on a protein called Bcl-6. This protein initiates the production of T follicular helper cells. These cells work in the immune system to generate antibodies specifically against the invading pathogen. ""We had previously discovered that in a low interleukin-2 environment, the TFH gene program turns on, apparently pushing effector cells to become T follicular helper cells,"" Oestreich said. ""In this study, we realized that both the T follicular helper cells and memory profiles were turning on."" Memory cells recognize pathogens that have previously infected the body and quickly respond with the correct antibodies. ""We found that the effector cells not only have both the T follicular helper cells and central memory profiles, but they also expressed receptors for two different proteins -- interleukin-6 and interleukin-7,"" Oestreich said. Scientists already knew interleukin-6 influenced T follicular helper cell development, and they also knew interleukin-7 was important for memory maintenance, ensuring memory cells persist for years after an initial infection. Oestreich's team discovered that the presence of either of these proteins could push a cell toward one fate or another. ""Just as the presence of interleukin-2 or interleukin-6 increases Bcl-6 and encourages the T follicular helper cell gene program, the presence of interleukin-7 can decrease Bcl-6 and influence effector cells to become memory cells,"" McDonald said. Memory cells conduct antigen surveillance and are immediately able to recognize the pathogen. ""Central memory cells allow for such a quick response to antigens that infection typically doesn't have a chance to form. You might not even know you've been infected,"" McDonald said. ""Formation of these cells is critical for a vaccine to work well."" Vaccines introduce antigens to the immune system to trigger antibody and memory cell production, usually without the host developing symptoms of an illness. If an active antigen invades the body, the memory cells can reactivate and assist in antibody production, eliminating the infection before it causes symptoms. ""We still have a lot of work to do,"" Oestreich said. ""But this is a promising first step in understanding the mechanisms by which memory cells form, which ultimately will play a role in improving vaccine efficacy.""","Published: January 13, 2016"

The projectiles were found 6 to 12 inches below ground using metal detectors. Carefully labeled by type and location, and classified as fired or unfired, they were sent for analysis by Yeshion, who has more than 40 years of experience as a forensic scientist, crime laboratory director, special agent and forensic consultant. Of the 97 projectiles determined to have been fired, seven buckshot tested positive for the presence of blood. A sample of the unfired projectiles was also tested as a negative control to ensure that nothing in the metal or soil would produce a false positive reaction. Using his results and other archaeological information as a guide, field archaeologists will plot the locations from which the buckshot were recovered and incorporate the information in their attempt to prepare a comprehensive account of the battle. Fought in August 1777, the Battle of Bennington was a clash between the British forces of Gen. John Burgoyne and Col. Friedrich Baum and Colonial forces under Brig. Gen. John Stark and Col. Seth Warner. The British were overwhelmingly defeated, contributing to Burgoyne s surrender at Saratoga, N.Y., two months later. Yeshion was contacted to assist in the area of blood detection because of his reputation and experience as an expert in forensic analysis and using Luminol as a presumptive blood test.  Luminol is a highly sensitive presumptive blood test used in criminal case investigations to detect trace amounts of blood that often has been cleaned up by a perpetrator,  Yeshion said of the process he used. He has successfully used Luminol to find blood in criminal cases as old as 20 years, on the Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg, Pa., and on artifacts that were carbon-dated to be between 5,000 and 10,000 years old. He conducted the Bennington Battlefield projectile analysis in the presence of his Advanced Criminalistics class in November. Yeshion provided the Luminol reagents and did not charge a fee for this service.  It is important for me to expose students to actual analysis,  Yeshion said.  It is important for them to see how this can be done, whether the evidence in question is from a current crime scene or a 238-year-old forensic reconstruction.  Yeshion is a founding fellow of the Edinboro University Institute for Forensic Sciences, an interdisciplinary institute formed to provide excellence in undergraduate education and training in the forensic sciences. It draws on faculty from diverse academic disciplines, including criminal justice, anthropology and art. The Institute also brings together a number of Edinboro educational and research facilities, including the Forensic Sciences and Crime Scene Investigation labs, the Anthropological Research Center and Archaeology Lab, and the Digital Imaging Lab. By promoting faculty and student research and providing opportunities for students to engage in real-world forensic projects, the Institute is able to enhance the educational experience for students interested in a multitude of forensic disciplines.","Published: January 13, 2016"

This finding, published in Obstetrics & Gynecology, questions traditional advice that couples should wait at least three months after a loss before attempting a new pregnancy. The World Health Organization, for example, recommends waiting a minimum of six months between a pregnancy loss and a subsequent attempt. ""Couples often seek counseling on how long they should wait until attempting to conceive again,"" said Enrique Schisterman, Ph.D., chief of the Epidemiology Branch at NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and senior author of the study. ""Our data suggest that women who try for a new pregnancy within three months can conceive as quickly, if not quicker, than women who wait for three months or more."" Previous studies of pregnancy spacing have focused on when women should become pregnant after experiencing a loss, but few have addressed the question of when couples should start trying to conceive. In the current study, researchers analyzed data from the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) trial, a multisite block-randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that took place from 2007 to 2011. The trial, which evaluated the effect of daily low-dose aspirin on reproductive outcomes in women with a history of pregnancy loss, enrolled 1,228 women aged 18 to 40 years. NICHD investigators concentrated on 1,083 of these women, more than 99 percent of whom had lost a pregnancy at less than 20 weeks gestation. None of the women had either of two potential complications of pregnancy: a tubal (ectopic) pregnancy or a molar pregnancy (growth of abnormal fetal tissue in the uterus). The participants were followed for up to six menstrual cycles and, if they became pregnant, until the outcome of their pregnancy was known. The researchers found that more than 76 percent of the women attempted to conceive within 3 months after losing a pregnancy. Compared to those who waited longer, this group was more likely to become pregnant (69 percent vs. 51 percent) and to have a pregnancy leading to a live birth (53 percent vs. 36 percent). The investigators did not observe any increase in the risk of pregnancy complications in this group. ""While we found no physiological reason for delaying attempts at conception following a pregnancy loss, couples may need time to heal emotionally before they try again,"" said Karen Schliep, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in the NICHD Epidemiology Branch at the time of the study and primary author of the study.

The underlying technique is PLOT-cryoadsorption, or PLOT-cryo--short for porous layer open tubular cryogenic adsorption. PLOT-cryo is sensitive, quantitative and more broadly useful than many competing techniques. It can identify compounds that don't readily evaporate and is not limited to samples dissolved in water, for example. The method recovers vapors by suction or by sweeping a gas across the air above a sample of interest. The laboratory version of the technique has been used to find traces of explosives, spoiled food, residues in arson debris and gravesoil. The new portable kit collects trace chemicals while analysis is performed with other instruments such as gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, which can also be made portable. In initial demonstrations of the kit in the lab, chemist Tom Bruno recovered and reliably identified substances such as the chemical compound coumarin, the explosive TNT, and diesel fuel. Collection times as fast as 3 seconds produced definitive results. The kit detected diesel fuel--a concern with respect to illegal dumping and leaking tanks--with a sensitivity better than one part per million. There is no other portable instrument that can detect traces of as wide a range of these types of compounds, Bruno says. The NIST kit is powered by compressed air, which enables operation without electrical power and ensures safety in potentially flammable and explosive environments. Compressed air is available on many emergency response vehicles. A key component of the kit is a vortex tube, which--without any moving parts--rotates compressed air to make hot or cold air streams. Vapors are collected in sturdy, inexpensive tubes embedded in an epoxy wafer. The wafer can be used inside either an insulated handpiece for manual sampling or a longer probe for remote sampling of soil and spaces under buildings or in luggage or other containers. With either the handpiece or probe, the wafer can be chilled to collect vapors, and then heated to help remove them. For now, the portable kit is less sensitive than the lab version of the method, but research continues to improve performance. Bruno has fielded interest in the basic technique from an instrument company, detectives, and film producers looking for a missing explorer.

This relationship will uniquely position SCIEX to address a major challenge in complex sample preparation by marketing a complete solution to increase the depth, breadth, and reproducibility of protein extraction, digestion and quantitation in all tissue types, including challenging samples like tumors. Under this Agreement, PBI and SCIEX will promote pressure cycling technology (PCT) sample preparation systems such as PCT-HD (PCT High Definition) with SWATH  Acquisition based next-generation proteomics, TripleTOF  Systems, QTRAP  Systems, and Triple Quad Systems. This focus on improved sample preparation, a crucial step performed in research laboratories worldwide, will enable scientists to extract more proteins reproducibly from complex sample types, potentially yielding superior biological insights and discoveries. PCT Sample Preparation Systems enable faster, automated, less cumbersome, and higher quality extraction, homogenization, and digestion of proteins from tissue samples by utilizing controlled cycles of pressure to break apart the samples. This results in faster and improved sample processing, and a higher quality of results. When combined with SWATH  Acquisition, the ""missing data problem"" is vastly improved, as PCT-based sample preparation increases the reproducibility and quantitative accuracy of label-free proteomics, greatly outperforming classic  shotgun  methods that measure an incomplete set of proteins that are difficult to reproduce. Thus, SWATH  Acquisition with PCT sample preparation makes reproducible proteome research feasible across the enormous diversity of complex biological samples. PCT-HD was developed by PBI scientists and engineers in collaboration with Professor Ruedi Aebersold and Dr. Tiannan Guo of the Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zurich, and the University of Zurich, in Switzerland. Drs. Aebersold and Guo combined PCT-HD sample preparation with SCIEX s SWATH-Mass Spectrometry   naming the resulting method  PCT-SWATH . This unique protocol can yield proteome analysis results within 12 hours from the start of processing tissue, much faster than current methods.  By addressing the significant challenges inherent in complex sample preparation to reproducibly analyze thousands of proteins in hundreds of samples, PCT-SWATH accelerates proteomics research in biologically and clinically-relevant contexts,  states Dr. Aebersold.  This should increase the chance for biomarker discovery, potentially leading to significant improvements in healthcare, including personalized medicine.   Advancing precision medicine through the ability to reproducibly quantitate thousands of proteins in large clinical sample cohorts is of the utmost importance to both academic and clinical research labs,  said Mark Cafazzo, Director of Academic and Clinical Research Business at SCIEX.  The combination of PCT sample preparation with SWATH Acquisition delivers a powerful method to industrialize proteomics research, including the most complex and challenging biospecimens. By partnering with PBI and adding the PCT technology to SCIEX next-generation proteomic solutions, we help scientists address the sample preparation challenges they face every day, especially when working with difficult tissue samples.  Mr. Cafazzo continued:  The net result is more comprehensive protein quantitation from complex samples, increased productivity and higher quality results. This is an exciting step forward for the field of proteomics, one that offers the potential to make a great and lasting impact on the quality of human life.   Bringing the PCT platform into the research laboratory enables scientists to efficiently and reproducibly break apart tissue samples and greatly accelerate their processing,  said Richard T. Schumacher, President and CEO of PBI.  By combining these methods with SCIEX s expertise and successful history in mass spectrometry system solutions, clinical researchers will be equipped to make major leaps forward in proteomic analysis, over the current limitations of traditional methods.  While mass spectrometry (MS) is already the gold standard tool for proteomic analysis, advanced sample preparation techniques like the PCT platform, which decrease starting material requirements while increasing the quality of results, will continue to expand the use of mass spectrometry in clinical research. This agreement between SCIEX and PBI is expected to significantly expand the footprint of MS-based quantitation workflows in clinical research settings worldwide.

At the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Dr. Bj rn Busse and his research group have advanced their micro-indentation testing technique using an Olympus industrial inspection digital light microscope, as an alternative to electron microscopy. The cutting edge research is described in a new application note from Olympus, available online. Micro-indentation analysis is a popular tool for investigating the mechanical properties of a material. When investigating cross-sectioned bone samples embedded in polymer, the visual inspection of the indentation site is vital to verify the analysis of mineralized material rather than polymer matrix. In Dr. Busse s laboratory, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was previously employed, but this was found to be both labour-intensive and time-consuming. Indentation assessment has now been streamlined using the latest digital light microscopy technology of the Olympus DSX500i inverted microscope. Dr Busse comments:  In the past we used SEM, which is labour-intensive in terms of sample preparation, and the DSX500i now provides a faster and easier way of ensuring we have indented the correct region.  Merging high resolution and operating simplicity, the all-in-one, fully motorized system features 13x zoom optics and a host of digital capabilities to enhance a range of inspection tasks. The inverted platform also overcomes the restrictions of sample size, allowing the largest samples to be investigated. The system has since been updated with the Olympus DSX510i, which now features guaranteed repeatability of measurements along the XY axis and Z-plane, in addition to upgraded digital features. Combining Olympus  digital light microscopy technology with micro-indentation testing offers possibilities throughout a vast field of applications across all sectors of material science. In fact, the DSX range was designed with industrial quality control in mind, and the innovative work of Dr. Busse s laboratory reflects its inherent versatility. In the industrial setting, the ability to extract information from a diverse array of samples throughout a broad range of applications is highly beneficial. With its advanced capabilities and ease of use, the Olympus DSX510i digital light microscope presents many opportunities to accelerate research into the understanding the mechanical properties of bone   and other materials.","Published: January 13, 2016"

Although both studies were carried out in rats, the researchers believe the findings will be relevant to humans. Cocaine is a stimulant drug that can lead to addiction when taken repeatedly. Quitting can be extremely difficult for some people: around four in ten individuals who relapse report having experienced a craving for the drug - however, this means that six out of ten people have relapsed for reasons other than 'needing' the drug. ""Most people who use cocaine do so initially in search of a hedonic 'high',"" explains Dr David Belin from the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Cambridge. ""In some individuals, though, frequent use leads to addiction, where use of the drug is no longer voluntary, but ultimately becomes a compulsion. We wanted to understand why this should be the case."" Drug-taking causes a release in the brain of the chemical dopamine, which helps provide the 'high' experienced by the user. Initially the drug taking is volitional in other words, it is the individual's choice to take the drug but over time, this becomes habitual, beyond their control. Previous research by Professor Barry Everitt from the Department of Psychology at Cambridge showed that when rats were allowed to self-administer cocaine, dopamine-related activity occurred initially in an area of the brain known as the nucleus accumbens, which plays a significant role driving 'goal-directed' behavior, as the rats sought out the drug. However, if the rats were given cocaine over an extended period, this activity transferred to the dorsolateral striatum, which plays an important role in habitual behavior, suggesting that the rats were no longer in control, but rather were responding automatically, having developed a drug-taking habit. The brain mechanisms underlying the balance between goal-directed and habitual behavior involves the prefrontal cortex, the brain region that orchestrates our behavior. It was previously thought that this region was overwhelmed by stimuli associated with the drugs, or with the craving experienced during withdrawal; however, this does not easily explain why the majority of individuals relapsing to drug use did not experience any craving. Chronic exposure to drugs alters the prefrontal cortex, but it also alters an area of the brain called the basolateral amygdala, which is associated with the link between a stimulus and an emotion. The basolateral amygdala stores the pleasurable memories associated with cocaine, but the pre-frontal cortex manipulates this information, helping an individual to weigh up whether or not to take the drug: if an addicted individual takes the drug, this activates mechanisms in the dorsal striatum. However, in a study published in the journal Nature Communications, Dr Belin and Professor Everitt studied the brains of rats addicted to cocaine through self-administration of the drug and identified a previously unknown pathway within the brain that links impulse with habits. The pathway links the basolateral amygdala indirectly with the dorsolateral striatum, circumventing the prefrontal cortex. This means that an addicted individual would not necessarily be aware of their desire to take the drug. ""We've always assumed that addiction occurs through a failure or our self-control, but now we know this is not necessarily the case,"" explains Dr Belin. ""We've found a back door directly to habitual behavior. ""Drug addiction is mainly viewed as a psychiatric disorder, with treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy focused on restoring the ability of the prefrontal cortex to control the otherwise maladaptive drug use. But we've shown that the prefrontal cortex is not always aware of what is happening, suggesting these treatments may not always be effective."" In a second study, published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, Dr Belin and colleagues showed that a drug used to treat paracetamol overdose may be able to help individuals addicted to cocaine overcome their addiction provided the individual wants to quit. The drug, N-acetylcysteine, had previously been shown in rat studies to prevent relapse. However, the drug later failed human clinical trials, though analysis suggested that while it did not lead addicted individuals to stop using cocaine, amongst those who were trying to abstain, it helped them refrain from taking the drug. Dr Belin and colleagues used an experiment in which rats compulsively self-administered cocaine. They found that rats given N-acetylcysteine lost the motivation to self-administer cocaine more quickly than rats given a placebo. In fact, when they had stopped working for cocaine, they tended to relapse at a lower rate. N-acetylcysteine also increased the activity in the brain of a particular gene associated with plasticity - the ability of the brain to adapt and learn new skills. ""A hallmark of addiction is that the user continues to take the drug even in the face of negative consequences such as on their health, their family and friends, their job, and so on,"" says co-author Mickael Puaud from the Department of Pharmacology of the University of Cambridge. ""Our study suggests that N-acetylcysteine, a drug that we know is well tolerated and safe, may help individuals who want to quit to do so."" University of Cambridge  press release Murray JE et al.

The research on Bengalese finches showed that each of their vocal muscles can change its function to help produce different parameters of sounds, in a manner similar to that of a trained opera singer.  Our research suggests that producing really complex song relies on the ability of the songbirds  brains to direct complicated changes in combinations of muscles,  says Samuel Sober, a biologist at Emory University and lead author of the study.  In terms of vocal control, the bird brain appears as complicated and wonderful as the human brain.  Pitch, for example, is important to songbird vocalization, but there is no single muscle devoted to controlling it.  They don t just contract one muscle to change pitch,  Sober says.  They have to activate a lot of different muscles in concert, and these changes are different for different vocalizations. Depending on what syllable the bird is singing, a particular muscle might increase pitch or decrease pitch.  Previous research has revealed some of the vocal mechanisms within the human  voice box,  or larynx. The larynx houses the vocal cords and an array of muscles that help control pitch, amplitude and timbre. Instead of a larynx, birds have a vocal organ called the syrinx, which holds their vocal cords deeper in their bodies. While humans have one set of vocal cords, a songbird has two sets, enabling it to produce two different sounds simultaneously, in harmony with itself.  Lots of studies look at brain activity and how it relates to behaviors, but muscles are what translates the brain s output into behavior,  Sober says.  We wanted to understand the physics and biomechanics of what a songbird s muscles are doing while singing.  The researchers devised a method involving electromyography (EMG) to measure how the neural activity of the birds activates the production of a particular sound through the flexing of a particular vocal muscle. The results showed the complex redundancy of the songbird s vocal muscles.  It tells us how complicated the neural computations are to control this really beautiful behavior,  Sober says, adding that songbirds have a network of brain regions that non-songbirds do not.  Emory University  Original reporting by: Carol Clark Srivastava KH, Elemans CPH, Sober SJ.

Recently published in Neuron, the finding could provide fresh drug targets and lead to new therapies for the disorder, which affects one in 68 children in the United States. ""Our discovery will shed new light on how genetic mutations lead to autism,"" said principal investigator Dr Kelsey Martin, interim dean and a professor of biological chemistry at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ""Before we can develop an effective therapy to target a gene, we must first understand how the gene operates in the cell."" See Also: Largest-ever autism genome study finds most siblings have different autism-risk genes The UCLA team focused on a gene called Rbfox1, which regulates how the cell makes proteins. ""Identifying a gene's function is critical for molecular medicine,"" said coauthor Daniel Geschwind, the Gordon and Virginia MacDonald Distinguished Professor of Human Genetics and a professor of neurology and psychiatry at UCLA. ""My colleagues discovered that Rbfox1 has an entirely new function that other scientists had overlooked."" Earlier studies by Geschwind and others have linked mutations in Rbfox1 to an increased risk for autism, which makes Rbfox1 an especially important gene to study. To better understand how Rbfox1 functions, Martin teamed up with UCLA molecular geneticist Douglas Black. The two blended a cell biology approach with powerful DNA-sequencing technology to reveal the identities of the genes controlled by Rbfox1.

Credit: Martin lab, UCLA  ""Scientists used to think that Rbfox1 worked primarily in the nucleus to allow genes to make multiple proteins. We were surprised to see that Rbfox1 also controls more than 100 genes in the cytoplasm,"" Lee said. ""A majority of these genes encode proteins critical to the brain's development and have been tied to autism risk."" Furthermore, the genes controlled by Rbfox1 in the cell's nucleus were completely different from those it controlled in the cell's cytoplasm. The UCLA team's separation of these two functions revealed that the genes targeted by RBfox1 in the cell's cytoplasm were highly enriched in proteins vital to the developing brain. Autism risk increases when these genes go awry. ""While some experts have hinted at the role of cytoplasmic genes in autism risk, no one has explored it in actual cells before,"" said Martin, who is also a professor of psychiatry at UCLA's Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior. ""Our study is the first to discover that dozens of autism risk genes reside in the cytoplasm and share common pathways in regulating the brain cells."" To pinpoint new drug targets, the researchers' next step will be to learn how Rbfox1 controls genes in the cytoplasm. ""This is a fundamental discovery that poses significant treatment implications,"" Geschwind concluded. ""Because so many genes are linked to autism risk, identifying common pathways where these genes overlap will greatly simplify our ability to develop new treatments.""

The team also found that increasing the levels of this hormone, called FGF21, protects against the loss of immune function that comes with age. Published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study s findings have future implications for improving immune function in the elderly, for obesity, and for illnesses such as cancer and type-2 diabetes. When functioning normally, the thymus produces new T cells for the immune system, but with age, the thymus becomes fatty and loses its ability to produce new T cells. This loss of new T cells in the body is one cause of increased risk of infections and certain cancers in the elderly. Led by Vishwa Deep Dixit, professor of comparative medicine and immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine, the researchers studied transgenic mice with elevated levels of FGF21. The team knocked out the gene s function and studied the impact of decreasing levels of FGF21 on the immune system. They found that increasing the levels of FGF21 in old mice protected the thymus from age-related fatty degeneration and increased the ability of the thymus to produce new T cells, while FGF21 deficiency accelerated the degeneration of the thymus in old mice.  We found that FGF21 levels in thymic epithelial cells is several fold higher than in the liver therefore FGF21 acts within the thymus to promote T cell production,  said Dixit.  Elevating the levels of FGF21 in the elderly or in cancer patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation may be an additional strategy to increase T cell production, and thus bolster immune function,  said Dixit. Dixit added that FGF21 is produced in the liver as an endocrine hormone. Its levels increase when calories are restricted to allow fats to be burned when glucose levels are low. FGF21 is a metabolic hormone that improves insulin sensitivity and also induces weight loss; therefore it is being studied for its therapeutic effects in type-2 diabetes and obesity. Dixit said further studies will focus on understanding how FGF21 protects the thymus from aging, and whether elevating FGF21 pharmacologically can extend the human healthspan and lower the incidence of disease caused by age-related loss of immune function.  We will also look to developing a way to mimic calorie restriction to enhance immune function without actually reducing caloric intake.  Yale University  Original reporting by: Karen N.

With this announcement, the application of precision medicine in the oncology setting has now emerged from research to the clinical cancer setting   a significant milestone in precision medicine and the war against cancer. GPS Cancer is a CLIA-certified diagnostic test that combines whole genome sequencing of tumor-normal specimens together with RNA sequencing and quantitative protein analysis to identify the protein pathways active in the individual s cancer. GPS Cancer is the nation s first CLIA-certified comprehensive DNA/RNA test with quantitative proteomics to receive reimbursement coverage in the clinical setting. Sequencing the whole DNA of three billion base pairs with over 20,000 genes, as well as RNA to identify those mutated genes which express the proteins from a patient s cancer, provides comprehensive and critical molecular information. Only through this comprehensive test can the physician more accurately identify which of the multitude of molecular alterations that are present in cancer cells translate to abnormal proteins being produced and which are the key targets for many therapeutic interventions. It is anticipated that the commercial launch of the GPS Cancer test will occur by March 2016.  Independence Blue Cross is committed to bringing state-of-the-art advances in oncology to our members and making care accessible and affordable,  said Daniel J. Hilferty, President and Chief Executive Officer of Independence Blue Cross.  Decisions around cancer care are complex and personal. We re focused on supporting Independence members and their oncologists by offering coverage for this innovative approach to treating cancer. Whole genome sequencing is one more option to help inform a personalized, effective treatment plan.  Independence s agreement with NantHealth involves a very specific and complex lab study related to cancer, next-generation whole genomic sequencing of tumor DNA, and related proteomic testing, for certain types of cancer. The test will be covered for members with specific conditions including rare cancers, tumors in children, metastatic cancer of unknown primary brain cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and metastatic cancer where conventional therapies have been exhausted and patients remain candidates for further therapy, including immunotherapy. Coverage for the testing will be available to eligible members of Independence commercial plans beginning in March 2016. The GPS Cancer test includes a web-based clinical report that provides actionable patient-specific clinical information for the physician and patient at the point of care. NantHealth, which already offers the Eviti oncology decision support software, recently announced the addition of NaviNet Open, a payer-provider collaboration platform. The eviti clinical decision support platform facilitates determination of evidence-based protocols based on the molecular and clinical stage of the patient s cancer. The NaviNet Open payer-provider collaboration platform enables doctors and payers to review information in real time. Taken together this NantHealth operating system now serves as a scalable, real-time access point and a portal for providers and patients to receive scientific, clinical and other information in real time about novel therapies and relevant clinical trials, all based on the results from the patient s GPS Cancer test.  The launch of GPS Cancer, together with coverage by a major payer serving with their affiliates 10 million people in 34 states, combined with the introduction of a collaboration and clinical decision support portal providing access to over 450,000 healthcare professionals for real-time communications and access to ground breaking clinical trials, and a multi-payer portal for over 100 million covered lives, collectively creates a healthcare collaboration network at national scale. This platform, we believe, will provide more effective treatment options for patients with cancer,  said Patrick Soon-Shiong, M.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of NantWorks and the Chan Soon-Shiong Institute of Molecular Medicine. He added,  Utilizing the cloud-based system of NaviNet Open and eviti makes possible provider access to over 90% of covered lives in the United States and will serve as a transformative platform for the communication of cutting-edge clinical information in real time to all physicians and their patients in this nation as well as bring precision medicine in oncology from the research setting to clinical deployment today. Coverage of GPS Cancer by Independence Blue Cross enables NantHealth and NantOmics to begin the process of generating patient-specific clinical information that will improve the evidence base on which providers determine their treatment decisions.   At Independence, we are committed to transforming cancer care via an integrated, evidence-based, personalized approach that enables patients and their physicians to make better informed decisions,  said Don Liss, M.D., Vice President of Clinical Programs and Policy at Independence.  The science around genomics and immunotherapy and their potential to advance our approach to cancer care is evolving. Entering into a relationship with NantHealth, and supporting the Cancer MoonShot 2020 Program, are two ways that we can contribute to the evidence-base and   potentially   help to revolutionize our approach to cancer care.  Robert Watson, President of NantHealth said,  The time is now right to bring the potential for precision medicine to cancer patients. With the launch of GPS Cancer and our agreement with Independence Blue Cross to provide coverage for NantHealth s GPS Cancer test, we have set the stage to move from the bench-to-bedside to more rapidly begin the process of improving the health of patients with cancer.

That s because it s been silenced, keeping most of its DNA locked up and unread like a book in a cage. Scientists thought they had figured out how cells do this, but a new piece of research from the University of Michigan Medical School shows the answer isn t quite that clear. And the findings could help lead to new ways of fighting diseases linked to X chromosomes in girls and women   the kind that occur when the X chromosome that doesget read has misprints and defects.In a new paper U-M genetic researchers show that a molecule called Xist RNA is insufficient to silence the X chromosome. The gene for that molecule, Xist, has been seen as the key factor in silencing one of the two X chromosomes in every female cell. The findings come from the same team that recently showed how a fragment of genetic material made from reading Xist backward, called an antisense RNA, leads to the production of Xist RNA.  Xist is widely believed to be both necessary and sufficient for X silencing,  says team leader Sundeep Kalantry, Ph.D.  We for first time show that it s not sufficient, that there have to be other factors, on the X-chromosome itself, that activate Xist and then cooperate with Xist RNA to silence the X-chromosome.  What s more, Kalantry says, in the future it may be possible to change the level of these other factors in cells and turn on the healthy, silenced copy of a gene that lies on the inactive X-chromosome. More about Xist The Xist gene, short for X-inactive specific transcript, is found on each X chromosome. It doesn t tell cells to produce a protein, like most genes do. Instead, it produces Xist RNA that physically coats the entire X-chromosome, and thereby is thought to seal most of it off from the rest of the cellular world. Now, the U-M group has shown that Xist has to have accomplices. Though they are close to identifying these accomplices, they do know that they reside in a very interesting place: the X chromosome that s destined to get silenced. Although most genes on the inactive X chromosome are fully silenced, a handful of the genes on the inactive X are in fact active.  It is this set of X-inactivation  escapees  that the research team focused on. Since the  escapee  genes are expressed from both the active and the inactive X-chromosomes in females, they produce more gene product in female cells than in male cells, which only have a single X.  The Kalantry lab s study predicts that it s this higher  dose  in females that triggers X-inactivation selectively in females; the lower dose in males is insufficient.  That means that if researchers can determine exactly which factors cause X-inactivation to occur, they could find ways to affect the activity of genes on the X chromosomes   specifically, genes involved in certain diseases. X marks the spot A wide range of relatively rare diseases   as well as relatively common conditions such as autism, hemophilia and muscular dystrophy   are linked to problems with genes found on the X chromosome. Many of them have an impact on an individual s thinking and memory capacity, and other aspects of cognition and intelligence.  In females, we could envision  reawakening  a healthy copy of an X-linked gene on the inactive X chromosome, by modulating the dose of these so-called escapee genes and ameliorating the effects of the unhealthy copy,  says Kalantry. Unfortunately, this approach probably won t help males with X-linked diseases, because they only have a single X chromosome in each cell and inactivating it would be harmful. But that s exactly what made the new research possible: The team attempted to silence the sole X chromosome in male stem cells from mice by turning Xiston artificially.  As it turns out, they could only silence the X-chromosome genes somewhat   because the male cells had no  twin sister  X chromosome to contribute the genes needed to finish the silencing job. When the researchers used female cells that had one X that was already inactivated   and therefore had the same number of active X-chromosome as in males   they were still able to silence the active X when they artificially turned Xist on from that chromosome. The difference was that the female cells had higher levels of products made by  escapee  genes. Now, Kalantry says, the team is zeroing in on the specific X-inactivation escapee genes that first allow for Xist RNA to be expressed and then work with Xist to make silencing possible.","Published: January 12, 2016"

ReNeuron is researching the therapeutic potential of exosomes derived from its proprietary stem cell lines. The Company is also exploring the potential of its exosomes as a delivery system for gene therapy treatments. Exosomes are lipid-based nanoparticles secreted from all cells. They play a key role in the transfer of beneficial proteins and particularly non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) from one cell to another. The paper,  Investigation of content, stoichiometry and transfer of miRNA from human neural stem cell line derived exosomes , has been published in the Journal PLOS ONE and describes work undertaken by ReNeuron researchers to characterize the composition of exosomes secreted from the Company s clinical-grade CTX stem cell line. The paper identifies a unique set of highly enriched miRNAs contained within CTX-derived exosomes. The exosomes were able to transfer these miRNAs out of CTX cells to neighbouring cells, where they significantly down-regulated the expression of a target protein within the recipient cells. The Company believes that this is the first published molecular demonstration that exosomes can deliver a therapeutic microRNA in sufficient quantities to alter protein expression in target cells. In particular, miRNAs delivered via ReNeuron s CTX-derived exosomes may have significant impact in the regulation of target cell growth and cell death. The paper therefore lends empirical support to a potential miRNA-based mechanism of action of CTX-derived exosomes as a therapeutic agent in cancer applications. The data also point to the potential use of CTX-derived exosomes as a delivery vehicle for other therapeutic genes in gene therapy applications. The PLOS ONE paper can be found at:http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146353 ReNeuron has filed multiple patent applications covering the composition, manufacture and therapeutic use of its exosome nanomedicine platform, including the particular miRNAs that are highly expressed and their therapeutic use in cancer. The Company has an ongoing programme of work to investigate the mechanism of action and utility of its exosome nanomedicine platform in a range of potential cancer indications. The publication of the PLOS ONE paper follows yesterday s announcement by ReNeuron that it had been awarded a  2.1 million (US$3.0m) grant from Innovate UK to further advance its exosome nanomedicine platform in collaboration with the Cell Therapy Catapult and the Department of Biochemical Engineering at University College London. Dr John Sinden, Chief Scientific Officer of ReNeuron, said:  This paper demonstrates the unique characteristic of our CTX cells to preferentially enrich a set of microRNAs contained within their exosomes, which we have shown to have anti-cancer properties in pre-clinical models. The paper therefore represents a significant milestone in ReNeuron s ongoing research to harness the potential of exosomes derived from its proprietary stem cell lines as therapeutics in their own right and also as a system for delivering therapeutic genes.

The companies will initially focus on three defined oncology programs targeting different mutants and states of the RAS oncogenic protein. Warp Drive has the option to lead development of the therapeutic candidates from post IND filing up to phase 2 clinical studies, with Sanofi leading development through the filing of new drug applications.  Sanofi will lead global commercial activities on product(s) resulting from the collaboration and Warp Drive has the option to co-commercialize oncology therapeutics in the U.S. market.  Sanofi will manage all ex-US commercial activities and Warp Drive will receive commercial milestones and tiered royalties on product sales.  The antibiotic collaboration will focus on the discovery and development of novel Gram-negative therapeutics and Sanofi will lead all development activities. Sanofi will be responsible for global commercialization of the antibiotic products and will pay Warp Drive research, clinical, and regulatory milestones, plus tiered royalties and commercial milestones based on global sales. A review of Warp Drive's SMART platform and its application to RAS and other important disease targets was discussed in a plenary session at the recent AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics. Warp Drive believes that novel therapeutics targeting RAS will represent a significant advance in the future of oncology drug development.  Moreover, creating a new modality for currently undruggable targets by deploying the company's SMART platform has the potential to open up new avenues for additional therapeutics in oncology and other important disease areas.","Published: January 12, 2016"

Now scientists from Plymouth University, working with the Plymouth Oncology Centre at Derriford Hospital, have used laboratory tests to demonstrate that treatment with auranofin can reduce the survival rates of cancerous cells exhibiting depleted levels of BRCA1 (breast cancer 1, early onset). BRCA1 deficiency also leads to increased irreparable damage, in the form of lethal DNA double strand breaks, in auranofin-treated ovarian cancer cells. The findings are presented in a study jointly funded by The Magic Rainbow Appeal within Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust and Plymouth University. Awadhesh Jha, Professor of Toxicology and Associate Head (Research) in the School of Biological Sciences, is the corresponding author of the study with Post-Doctoral Research Fellow Dr Deepu Oommen having carried out the laboratory tests. Professor Jha said: ""Using drugs such as auranofin to treat cancer is highly promising since they are readily available and their pharmacological and toxicological properties are well documented. Studies carried out with cells grown under laboratory conditions showed faults in the BRCA1 gene render these cells more vulnerable to auranofin compared to ovarian cancer cells with normal BRCA1 genes. It suggests that auranofin has the potential to be considered for future clinical studies to treat such ovarian cancers and this could serve as the spring board to use other available drugs which are not used as chemotherapeutic drugs."" BRCA1 is a DNA repair protein whose functional status is critical in the prognosis of ovarian cancer, and is mutated in around 15-20% of ovarian cancers. Previous investigations have suggested BRCA1 mutations predispose women to increased risks of developing ovarian and breast cancers, but are also more sensitive to DNA damaging chemotherapeutics and hence offer a good prognostic outcome. For this test, two types of ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR5 and SKOV3) were used, with BRCA1 expression levels depleted and compared to a control set. SKOV3 cells were relatively sensitive to auranofin generally, however upon BRCA1 depletion, cell survival was significantly reduced by up to 37% with an auranofin concentration of 1 parts per million. BRCA-1 depleted OVCAR5 cells also exhibited decreased survival, and thereby increased sensitivity to auranofin in a dose-dependent manner. Dr Dennis Yiannakis, Clinical Oncologist at the Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ""Our collaboration has focused on the field of DNA repair (particularly BRCA 1/2 mutated states) and its relevance to ovarian and lung cancer. The project is investigating the accurate diagnosis of faults in high fidelity DNA repair and how to manipulate it for therapeutic benefit in patients. This is an emerging area of potential ways of treating these cancers.""","Published: January 12, 2016"

They can transform into a cells of different organs, offering new ways to treat a range of injuries and diseases from Parkinson s to diabetes. But producing the right type of stem cells in a standardized manner is still a serious challenge. EPFL scientists have now developed a gel that boosts the ability of normal cells to revert into stem cells by  squeezing  them into shape with a 3D gel. The new technique can also be easily scaled up to produce stem cells for various applications on an industrial scale. There are different types of stem cells, but the ones that are of particular medical interest are the so-called  induced pluripotent stem cells  or iPSCs. These are derived from mature, adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to behave like stem cells (which is why they are  induced ). iPSCs can then be regrown into a whole range of different cells types, e.g. liver, pancreatic, lung, skin etc. There have been many attempts to design a standardized method for generating such stem cells. But even the most successful methods turn out to not be very effective, especially for use on a large scale. A major issue is that existing techniques use the two-dimensional environment of a petri dish or cell culture flask, whereas cells in the body exist in a three-dimensional world. The lab of Matthias Lutolf at EPFL has now developed a new method that may help to overcome these challenges. The approach uses a three-dimensional cell culture system. Normal cells are placed inside a gel that contains normal growth nutrients.  We try to simulate the three-dimensional environment of a living tissue and see how it would influence stem cell behavior,  explains Lutolf.  But soon we were surprised to see that cell reprogramming is also influenced by the surrounding microenvironment.  The microenvironment in this case, is the gel. The researchers discovered that they could reprogram the cells faster and more efficiently than current methods by simply adjusting the composition   and hence the stiffness and density   of the surrounding gel. As a result, the gel exerts different forces on the cells, essentially  squeezing  them. As a new phenomenon, this is not entirely understood. However, the scientists propose that the three-dimensional environment is key to this process, generating mechanical signals that work together with genetic factors to make the cell easier to transform into a stem cell.  Each cell type may have a  sweet spot  of physical and chemical factors that offer the most efficient transformation,  says Lutolf.  Once you find it, it is a matter of resources and time to create stem cells on a larger scale.  The greater impact of this discovery is possibly quantity. The technique can be applied to a large number of cells to produce stem cells on an industrial scale. Lutolf s lab is looking into this, but their main focus is to better understand the phenomenon, and to find the  sweet spots  for other cell types.","Published: January 12, 2016"

In a study that could point the way to biofuels processes of the future, scientists from Rice University, the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Joint BioEnergy Institute at Emeryville, Calif., have discovered how two bacterial enzymes work as a team to break apart lignin.  Ultimately, we would like to use enzymatic fermentation   the same process that brewers and winemakers have used for centuries   to convert all the sugar from plants into ethanol and other fuels,  said Rice s George Phillips, co-author of the study.  The big target is cellulose, which is the primary ingredient in wood, grass stems and corn stalks. Cellulose is basically sugar, but it is tightly packed in a crystalline compound that is practically indigestible. There are some fungi and bacteria that have developed enzymes to cut it apart, but it s a very slow process, which is why it can take years for dead trees to decompose.  Lignin, another major component of plant fibers that accounts for up to one-third of the carbon in biomass, compounds the problem for any microorganism that wants to eat cellulose or any scientist who wishes to turn it into biofuel. Lignin has a gluelike consistency, and it coats and protects cellulose.  The cellulose is tough, but organisms can t even get to it until they chew through the lignin,  said Phillips, Rice s Ralph and Dorothy Looney Professor of Biochemistry and Cell Biology and professor of chemistry. For industry, breaking down lignin has often proved an even tougher challenge than cellulose. As a result, the biofuels and paper industries mostly treat lignin as a waste product to be removed, isolated and discarded. Study co-author Timothy Donohue, professor of bacteriology at UW-Madison and director of the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center, said,  If we can convert lignin from an undesirable byproduct into a starting material for advanced biofuels and other lucrative chemicals, we would dramatically change the economics of tomorrow s biorefineries.  The center is one of three funded by the Department of Energy to make transformational breakthroughs in cellulosic biofuels technology. With an eye toward using techniques that nature has evolved to break down lignin, a team of researchers led by Donohue and Phillips began by studying bacterial enzymes that cleave specific chemical bonds inside lignin. The original goal was to design a single new enzyme that could do the job of several found in nature. But that turned out to be an impossible task, in part because lignin molecules are irregular. They re made of hundreds of components that twist either to the left or the right, but the pattern of twists doesn t repeat, and an enzyme that s tailored to break a left-handed bond won t cleave a right-handed one.  Making a single enzyme would be like trying to make a glove that s designed for your left hand fit on your right hand,  said Kate Helmich, co-lead author of the study and a recent Ph.D. graduate of UW-Madison s Biochemistry Department.  Our two hands are different configurations of the same fingers, and lignin is like a chain of many different hands. Degrading that entire chain would require an enzyme, or glove, that can attach to both the left and the right hands within it.  The researchers found that Sphingobium bacteria use two enzymes, known as LigE and LigF, to attack lignin as a team.  The key finding is that we now understand how the left-hand and the right-hand versions are broken,  Phillips said.  It s not through a single super enzyme but through teamwork where you ve got one for the left and one for right.  It wasn t clear how the bacteria did it until Donohue and his team made both the left-handed and right-handed compounds, and then assayed them with purified enzymes. Those experiments proved that one works on left and one works on right.  Helmich and Phillips used X-ray crystallography to analyze the structure of the enzymes and show how each performed its specialized task. Phillips, who moved to Rice from UW-Madison in 2013, said the research suggests that biofuels processors will need a cocktail of specialized enzymes to break lignin into fermentable components.  Now we know that such a cocktail would need to include something like LigE and LigF to get both hands of the lignin broken open,  he said.","Published: January 12, 2016"

The study increases the total number of such genes to 15.  Just in time for Glaucoma Awareness Month, this unprecedented analysis provides the most comprehensive genetic profile of glaucoma to date,  said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D.  These findings open avenues for the pursuit of new strategies to screen for, prevent, and treat glaucoma.  Glaucoma is a group of conditions that damage the optic nerve, the bundle of nerve fibers connecting the eye to the brain. Primary open angle glaucoma, the most common type, was studied in this analysis. In the majority of cases, pressure inside the eye is increased. Glaucoma affects side vision first, often going unnoticed for years. If detected early, vision loss can often be prevented with surgery or eye drops to lower pressure. The most common culprit of irreversible vision loss, glaucoma affects about 2.7 million Americans and 60 million people worldwide. Some rare types of glaucoma are inherited via a single gene. The underlying causes of primary open angle glaucoma remain poorly understood, but likely involve the interaction of many genes with environmental influences. The researchers compared the DNA of 3,853 people of European ancestry with primary open-angle glaucoma to a similar group of 33,480 people without it. Data for the analysis came from eight datasets generated by members of the NEIGHBORHOOD Consortium. NEIGHBORHOOD stands for NEI Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database. To ensure uniformity among the datasets, the researchers restricted their analysis to gene variants included in the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel a catalog of human genetic variability.  The analysis showed that specific variations in the genes FOXC1, TXNRD2, and ATXN2 are associated with glaucoma. Additional analyses of datasets from Europe, Australia/New Zealand, and Singapore also found associations between glaucoma and these gene variants. All three genes are expressed in the eye. TXNRD2 and ATXN2 are active in the optic nerve. Scientists had already identified an association between FOXC1 and glaucoma, but only in rare cases of severe early-onset glaucoma. The TXNRD2 gene makes an enzyme that protects mitochondria against oxidative stress the build-up of toxic byproducts from normal metabolism. Mitochondria are energy-producing cellular components. For years, scientists have suspected that oxidative stress might contribute to the degeneration of the optic nerve, but until now they lacked evidence.  This is the first direct report to show the association of a gene linking oxidative damage to glaucoma,  said Neeraj Agarwal, Ph.D., a program director at NEI. The study suggests that people with TXNRD2 gene variants may have a reduced ability to protect mitochondria from damage, leading to optic nerve cell death. Little is known about the normal function of ATXN2. Mutations of the gene are implicated in a rare disorder called spinocerebellar ataxia 2 that causes loss of balance and coordination. Interestingly, ATXN2 is the third gene associated with both glaucoma and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig s disease. However, there is no evidence that people with glaucoma are at greater risk of developing ALS.  Connecting these genes to glaucoma was possible only through close collaboration among NEIGHBORHOOD investigators,  said Janey Wiggs, M.D., Ph.D., associate director of the Ocular Genomics Institute at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, part of Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wiggs is the principal investigator for NEIGHBORHOOD and lead author of the report.","Published: January 12, 2016"

It recommends that health workers and policy makers give melioidosis a higher priority, and expects the number of melioidosis cases to rise as diabetes increases across the tropics, especially among the poor, and international travel increases the risk of introducing the pathogen to new areas. 'Although melioidosis has been recognised for more than 100 years, awareness of it is still low, even among medical and laboratory staff in confirmed endemic areas,' said study co-author Dr. Direk Limmathurotsakul, Head of Microbiology at MORU and Assistant Professor at Mahidol University (Thailand). 'We predict that the burden of this disease us likely to increase in the future because the incidence of diabetes mellitus is increasing and the movements of people and animals could lead to the establishment of new endemic areas.' The study is the first to provide an evidence-based estimate of the global extent of melioidosis, which is caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, a highly pathogenic bacterium commonly found in soil and water in South and Southeast Asia and northern Australia. Led by researchers at Oxford University, the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok, Thailand, the University of Washington in Seattle and Mahidol University in Thailand, among others, the study is funded by the Wellcome Trust. The highest melioidosis risk zones are in South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific including all countries in Southeast Asia and tropical Australia, Sub-Saharan Africa and South America, with risk zones of varying sizes in Central America, Southern Africa and the Middle East. Contracted through the skin, lungs or by drinking contaminated water, melioidosis can be difficult to diagnose as it mimics other diseases. The bacterium is resistant to a wide range of antimicrobials, and inadequate treatment may result in fatality rates exceeding 70%. 'Melioidosis is a great mimicker of other diseases and you need a good microbiology laboratory for bacterial culture and identification to make an accurate diagnosis. It especially affects the rural poor in the tropics who often do not have access to microbiology labs, which means that it has been greatly under estimated as an important public health problem across the world,' said Dr. Limmathurotsakul. 'Our study predicts high infection rates in countries like India and Vietnam, where the disease is gradually being recognised more frequently.' The study estimates that melioidosis killed 89,000 of the 165,000 people who got it in 2015   nearly as many as the annual global mortality from measles (95,000 deaths per year) and greater than deaths from leptospirosis (50,000 per year) or dengue (12,500 per year), two current health priorities for many international health organizations. High-risk melioidosis groups include patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease or excessive alcohol intake. The authors mapped documented hu8man and animal melioidosis cases and environmental reports of B. pseudomallei published between 1910 and 2014. They combined these in a formal model that suggests that melioidosis is severely under-reported in most of the 45 countries where it is known to be endemic, and that it is probably endemic in another 34 countries that have never reported the disease. The authors suggest these results highlight the need for this diseases to be given a higher priority by health workers, international health organisation and policy makers. 'We hope that this paper will help to raise awareness of the disease among all healthcare workers in endemic areas, as the disease can be treated if it is caught early enough,' said Oxford researcher Dr David Dance, one of the contributors to the report, who first highlighted the under-recognition of melioidosis 25 years ago and now studies infectious diseases including melioidosis at the Laos-Oxford-Mahosot-Wellcome Research Unit (LOMWRU) in Vientiane, Lao PDR.","Published: January 12, 2016"

The findings provide not only a new mechanistic explanation for microcephaly, but they could also aid understanding of autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders that are thought to arise from disruptions in the proper balance of neurons in the brain.  This study shows that the time it takes for a stem cell to divide matters during brain development,  said Debra Silver, an assistant professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at the Duke University School of Medicine.  But beyond microcephaly, I think it s going to be relevant for thinking about how stem cell dysfunction can change the repertoire of other cells in the body.  Microcephaly is a rare disease that causes intellectual disability and seizures. A genetic form of microcephaly manifests as the fetal brain develops during pregnancy; the cerebral cortex, a large brain structure responsible for abstract thought, memory and language, is particularly vulnerable to the disorder.  In 2010, Silver s group discovered that mice missing a single copy of a gene called Magoh have severely reduced brain size reminiscent of genetic microcephaly in people.  At the time, we really didn t know why,  said Silver, who is also a member of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences. The group zeroed in on neural stem cells which divide to form either a new stem cell or the beginning of a new neuron cell. The 2010 study found that the number of neural stem cells seemed out of balance with the number of neurons being produced in the Magoh-deficient brains.  The researchers suspected that the time it takes for one stem cell to divide into two -- a process called mitosis -- could be responsible for the imbalance. Other microcephaly-linked genes are known to control mitosis. But how mitosis defects caused microcephaly was unknown. In the new study, Silver s team found that about 30% of the stem cells in mice lacking Magoh took longer -- in some cases two or three times longer than usual -- to divide.  As scientists watched those cells using cutting-edge live imaging techniques, they were surprised to see that the sluggish stem cells tended to differentiate into neurons, and were also more likely to die.  It s really a combination that helps explain the microcephaly,  Silver said.  On one hand, you re really not making enough new stem cells, and if you don t have enough stem cells you can t make enough neurons in the brain. On the other hand, some neurons do get made, but a lot of them die.  Silver s team saw similar results (premature differentiation and death) when they extended the process of cell division in genetically normal mice using two different drugs. And further experiments suggest that both differentiation and death are distinct outcomes of the delayed stem cells, Silver said. Magoh is a protein that switches on the expression of many other important genes but it does not work alone. In fact, previous research has linked Magoh s partners in gene regulation to other neurodevelopmental diseases. The Duke team is now planning large-scale screening approaches to ask what other genetic pathways influence the decision point when a delayed stem cell makes a neuron. Silver s team is also exploring cell division in healthy brain development and has some preliminary data suggesting that timing matters. Studies published more than a decade ago show that mitosis takes increasingly longer as brain development progresses.  We have a really nice experimental system in place to ask about whether that could help to explain why more neurons are made as development proceeds,  Silver said.","Published: January 12, 2016"

The researchers, led by Tak-Sing Wong, assistant professor of mechanical engineering and the Wormley Family Early Career Professor in Engineering, call their invention SLIPSERS, which is a combination of Wong's slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS), a biologically inspired surface based on the Asian pitcher plant, and SERS. ""We have been trying to develop a sensor platform that allows us to detect chemicals or biomolecules at a single-molecule level whether they are dispersed in air, liquid phase, or bound to a solid,"" Wong said. ""Being able to identify a single molecule is already pretty difficult. Being able to detect those molecules in all three phases, that is really challenging."" Wong needed the help of postdoctoral fellow Shikuan Yang to combine SERS and SLIPS into a single process. Yang was trained in Raman spectroscopy in the characterization laboratory of Penn State's Materials Research Institute. His expertise in the SERS technique and Wong's knowledge of SLIPS enabled them to develop the SLIPSERS technology. Their work appeared online on December 31, 2015 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Raman spectroscopy is a well-known method of analyzing materials in a liquid form using a laser to interact with the vibrating molecules in the sample. The molecule's unique vibration shifts the frequency of the photons in the laser light beam up or down in a way that is characteristic of only that type of molecule. Typically, the Raman signal is very weak and has to be enhanced in some way for detection. In the 1970s, researchers found that chemically roughening the surface of a silver substrate concentrated the Raman signal of the material adsorbed on the silver, and SERS was born. Wong developed SLIPS as a post-doctoral researcher at Harvard University. SLIPS is composed of a surface coated with regular arrays of nanoscale posts infused with a liquid lubricant that does not mix with other liquids. The small spacing of the nanoposts traps the liquid between the posts and the result is a slippery surface to which nothing adheres. ""The problem is that trying to find a few molecules in a liquid medium is like trying to find a needle in a haystack,"" Wong said. ""But if we can develop a process to gradually shrink the size of this liquid volume, we can get a better signal. To do that we need a surface that allows the liquid to evaporate uniformly until it gets to the micro or nanoscale. Other surfaces can't do that, and that is where SLIPS comes in."" If a droplet of liquid is placed on any normal surface, it will begin to shrink from the top down. When the liquid evaporates, the target molecules are left in random configurations with weak signals. But if all the molecules can be clustered among the gold nanoparticles, they will produce a very strong Raman signal. ""First we need to use conductive nanoparticles, like gold,"" Shikuan Yang explained. ""And then we have to assemble them so they make nanoscale gaps between the particles, called hot spots. The molecules bind to the gaps and a very strong electromagnetic field forms. If we have a laser with the right wavelength, the electrons will oscillate and a strong magnetic field will form in the gap area. This gives us a very strong signal."" Although there are other techniques that allow researchers to concentrate molecules on a surface, those techniques mostly work with water as the medium. SLIPS can be used with any organic liquid. ""Our technique opens up larger possibilities for people to use other types of solvents to do single molecule SERS detection, such as environmental detection in soil samples,"" Yang said. ""If you can only use water, that is very limiting. ""In biology, researchers might want to detect a single base-pair mismatch in DNA. Our platform will give them that sensitivity."" One of the next steps will be to detect biomarkers in blood for disease diagnosis at the very early stages of cancer when the disease is more easily treatable. ""We have detected a common protein, but haven't detected cancer yet,"" Yang said. Although the SLIPS technology is patented and licensed, the team has not sought patent protection on their SLIPSERS work. ""We believe that offering this technology to the public will get it developed at a much faster pace,"" said Professor Wong. ""This is a powerful platform that we think many people will benefit from.""","Published: January 12, 2016"

The end-to-end commercial solution will enable high-throughput sequencing of thousands of individual cells, traditionally a challenging, costly and time-consuming process. Most scientific studies rely on analysis of bulk tissue samples. These samples are usually composed of multiple cell types with varying functions. Gene expression data is averaged across cells, making it difficult to identify differences between cells and to understand the role of cell variation. Single-cell sequencing addresses those challenges and provides deeper insight into cell function, disease progression and therapeutic response. These data can be important in studies of neurological tissues, for example, which are known to have hundreds of specialized cell types. Using Bio-Rad's best-in-class droplet partitioning technology and Illumina's leading NGS technologies, the new solution is optimized to isolate and barcode single cells for downstream sequencing. Data analysis is conducted via BaseSpace, Illumina's cloud-based genomics computing environment. The solution will be scalable to isolate significantly larger numbers of single cells compared to commercially available solutions today, in just a few minutes at a cost-effective price. ""We welcome the opportunity to collaborate with Illumina, the global leader in NGS technologies, to develop this long-awaited platform for single-cell genomics,"" said Annette Tumolo, Bio-Rad Executive Vice President and General Manager, Digital Biology Center. ""Through this partnership, we will deliver a seamless, yet scalable solution for single-cell gene expression analysis."" ""By collaborating with Bio-Rad, both companies will be able to serve the significant market for single-cell NGS, enabling scientists to make groundbreaking advances in gene expression and beyond,"" said Christian Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Illumina. ""Bio-Rad is recognized for delivering trusted, high-quality products in a market with increasingly stringent regulations and standards. We look forward to working with them on such an important endeavor."" The companies expect to launch the solution in late 2016 or early 2017.","Published: January 12, 2016"

Powered by Illumina sequencing technology, GRAIL will develop a pan-cancer screening test by directly measuring circulating nucleic acids in blood. Detecting cancer at the earliest stages dramatically increases long-term survival, hence the successful development of a pan-cancer screening test for asymptomatic individuals would make the first major dent in global cancer mortality. GRAIL's unique structure enables it to take on this grand challenge. GRAIL has been formed as a separate company, majority owned by Illumina. GRAIL is initially funded by over $100 million in Series A financing from Illumina and ARCH Venture Partners, with participating investments from Bezos Expeditions, Bill Gates and Sutter Hill Ventures. GRAIL's unique relationship with Illumina provides the ability to economically sequence at the high depths necessary to create a screening test with the required sensitivity and a hoped for level of specificity never before achievable for cancer screening. ""We hope today is a turning point in the war on cancer,"" said Jay Flatley, Illumina Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of GRAIL. ""By enabling the early detection of cancer in asymptomatic individuals through a simple blood screen, we aim to massively decrease cancer mortality by detecting the disease at a curable stage."" ""The holy grail in oncology has been the search for biomarkers that could reliably signal the presence of cancer at an early stage,"" said Dr. Richard Klausner, formerly Illumina Chief Medical Officer and NCI Director, and a Director of GRAIL. ""Illumina's sequencing technology now allows the detection of circulating nucleic acids originating in the cancer cells themselves, a superior approach that provides a direct rather than surrogate measurement."" ""GRAIL's rigorous, science-based approach with leading medical and policy advisors worldwide is unprecedented in the fight to defeat cancer,"" said Robert Nelsen, Managing Director and Co-Founder of ARCH Venture Partners and a Director of GRAIL. GRAIL has secured the counsel of a world-class set of industry and cancer experts for the company's advisory board, including Dr. Richard Klausner; Dr. Jose Baselga, Physician In Chief at Memorial Sloan Kettering and President of the American Association of Cancer Research; Dr. Brian Druker, Director, OHSU Knight Cancer Institute; Mostafa Ronaghi, Chief Technology Officer at Illumina; Don Berry, Professor at MD Anderson Cancer Center; Timothy Church, Professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health and Charles Swanton, Group Leader at the Francis Crick Institute.

The collaboration will use Synpromics' synthetic promoter design technology, and the Cell Therapy Catapult's flexible manufacturing platform to create stable producer cell lines for the high titre and large scale manufacture of viral vectors. The work will be part funded by a  2m grant from Innovate UK, the UK s innovation agency. Viral vectors are a crucial tool needed to modify patient s cells to create a therapeutic effect. Established manufacturing platforms are limited by laborious processes, a lack of automation and low yields. This restricts the utility of viral vectors for the treatment of diseases where large amounts of virus would be needed, and has to date confined their use to local applications such as in the eye and to less prevalent indications, including orphan diseases. This project will use synthetic biology to develop novel and controllable gene-expression promoters to drive the production of a much higher level of viral vector yield from new stable cell lines. This will allow the industry to produce vectors to much higher titres and with more efficiency, removing the current constraints associated with plasmid transfection of anchorage dependent cell lines. The project will run for three years, and will be focused on developing prototype cell lines to deliver industry relevant viral vectors, including Retrovirus, and Adeno Associated Virus. Synpromics will be responsible for the expression platform development with the Cell Therapy Catapult responsible for process industrialization and control.  The Cell Therapy Catapult has extensive experience in developing cell and gene therapies for clinical trial and commercialization. The collaboration between the Cell Therapy Catapult and Synpromics has brought together a number of complementary skills that will produce a solution to a big industrial challenge,  said Keith Thompson, CEO of the Cell Therapy Catapult. Dr David Venables, CEO of Synpromics, said,  This will be the fifth major collaboration for Synpromics to apply our synthetic promoters in gene therapy. We believe Synpromics  technology will provide a critically needed solution to high titre, industrial scale, vector manufacture, a critical barrier in the gene therapy industry.

Focusing on process safety competences for generalist OHS professions, the chapter will also be developed as part of a larger process safety competency framework. Trish Kerin, director of the IChemE Safety Centre said:  The collaboration is an opportunity to improve the approach to Process Safety generally.   It will focus on key competencies that are essential for professionals in general health and safety roles.  Pam Pryor, Registrar of the Australian OHS Education Accreditation Board and custodian of the OHS Body of Knowledge said:  This development is really exciting, as it recognizes the role of the generalist in supporting process safety, and will provide a conceptual knowledge base - including effective liaison with engineers.   Some professionals in generalist OHS roles have an engineering background. However, analysis of recent process engineering disasters has shown that all generalists operating in high-risk environments should have this foundation knowledge.  The ability to identify issues, contribute a unique perspective and engage with process safety specialists, is essential for managing safety in such environments.

That s the period of time doctors say is crucial for patients to get to a hospital to receive medical care in order to restore blood flow to the brain and minimize or reverse damage. But a new national US survey by Ronald Reagan University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center shows that younger patients, those under the age of 45, may underestimate the urgency of stroke symptoms and most say they would likely delay going to the hospital for help. See Also: Main component of brain repair after stroke identified  Timely treatment for stroke is probably more important than for almost any other medical problem there is,  said David Liebeskind, MD, professor of neurology, Director of Outpatient Stroke and Neurovascular Programs and Director of the Neurovascular Imaging Research Core at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.  There is a very limited window in which to start treatment because the brain is very sensitive to a lack of blood flow or to bleeding, and the longer patients wait, the more devastating the consequences.  Researchers asked more than a thousand people nationwide what they would be likely to do within the first three hours of experiencing weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking or difficulty seeing, all common symptoms of a stroke. Among those under age 45, only about one out of three said they would be very likely to go to the hospital. A staggering 73 percent said they would likely wait to see if their symptoms improved.  That s a real problem,  said Liebeskind.  We need to educate younger people about the symptoms of stroke and convince them of the urgency of the situation, because the numbers are going up.  Learn more: Images of brain after mild stroke predict future risk In fact, since the mid-1990 s, the number of young adults between 18-45 discharged from US hospitals after suffering a stroke has jumped as much as 53 percent. It s estimated someone has a stroke about every 40 seconds in the US, totaling nearly 800,000 new stroke patients a year. In 2007, Jennifer Reilly was one of them.  I woke up in the middle of the night with an excruciating headache,  said Reilly.  I was 27 years old, pretty active, pretty healthy and was not prone to headaches. I thought it was a really odd thing that happened.  Dr. David Liebeskind examines Jennifer Reilly at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Reilly had a stroke at age 27, one of a growing number of patients under the age of 45 in the United States to suffer a stroke. Credit: UCLA Health  After arriving at work that day, Reilly shared her story with a co-worker who insisted she go to the hospital immediately. Reilly eventually ended up at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where Liebeskind told her she d had a stroke.  I was really skeptical,  said Reilly.  I didn t have any of what I thought were the classic symptoms of a stroke, nor did I fit the classic description of a stroke patient. I was 27 and healthy.  Reilly says weeks before the headache, she would also experience numbness periodically in one of her hands.  Half of my left hand would turn numb, from just one second to the next,  she said,  but, once again, I brushed it off as if it was nothing.  Tests showed Reilly s stroke was caused by a rare condition called moyamoya that slowly causes certain blood vessels in the brain to narrow over time. Most patients, about 85 percent, suffer what are known as ischemic stroke, during which arteries in the brain become blocked, cutting off oxygen. Ischemic stroke can happen to anyone at any age, and is often associated with high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and obesity.  The good news is, there are steps we can take to lower our risk of stroke,  said Liebeskind. A healthy diet and regular exercise, as well as not smoking and limiting alcohol consumption, have all been shown to lower your risk of stroke. Just as important as knowing what puts you at a higher risk for stroke, is knowing the symptoms when you see them. Doctors urge you to know the signs of stroke and act  FAST.  If you or someone near you experiences:  Believe it or not, it s on the order of minutes or hours when somebody has to seek medical attention,  said Liebeskind.  There simply is no time to wait. It s a message that we clearly need to get to younger people more effectively.  UCLA Health   press release","Published: January 11, 2016"

But some neuroscientists caution that today's computers will never truly understand what we're saying because they do not take into account the context of a conversation the way people do. Specifically, say University of California (UC), Berkeley, postdoctoral fellow Arjen Stolk and his Dutch colleagues, machines don't develop a shared understanding of the people, place and situation often including a long social history that is key to human communication. Without such common ground, a computer cannot help but be confused. See Also: Researchers demonstrate direct brain-to-brain communication in human subjects ""People tend to think of communication as an exchange of linguistic signs or gestures, forgetting that much of communication is about the social context, about who you are communicating with,"" Stolk said. The word ""bank,"" for example, would be interpreted one way if you're holding a credit card but a different way if you're holding a fishing pole. Without context, making a ""V"" with two fingers could mean victory, the number two, or ""these are the two fingers I broke."" ""All these subtleties are quite crucial to understanding one another,"" Stolk said, perhaps more so than the words and signals that computers and many neuroscientists focus on as the key to communication. ""In fact, we can understand one another without language, without words and signs that already have a shared meaning."" Babies and parents, not to mention strangers lacking a common language, communicate effectively all the time, based solely on gestures and a shared context they build up over even a short time. Stolk argues that scientists and engineers should focus more on the contextual aspects of mutual understanding, basing his argument on experimental evidence from brain scans that humans achieve nonverbal mutual understanding using unique computational and neural mechanisms. Some of the studies Stolk has conducted suggest that a breakdown in mutual understanding is behind social disorders such as autism. ""This shift in understanding how people communicate without any need for language provides a new theoretical and empirical foundation for understanding normal social communication, and provides a new window into understanding and treating disorders of social communication in neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders,"" said Dr. Robert Knight, a UC Berkeley professor of psychology in the campus's Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute and a professor of neurology and neurosurgery at UC, San Francisco. Stolk and his colleagues discuss the importance of conceptual alignment for mutual understanding in an opinion piece that appears Jan. 11 in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences. To explore how brains achieve mutual understanding, Stolk created a game that requires two players to communicate the rules to each other solely by game movements, without talking or even seeing one another, eliminating the influence of language or gesture. He then placed both players in an fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imager) and scanned their brains as they nonverbally communicated with one another via computer. A game in which players try to communicate the rules without talking or even seeing one another helps neuroscientists isolate the parts of the brain responsible for mutual understanding. Credit: Arjen Stolk, UC Berkeley  He found that the same regions of the brain located in the poorly understood right temporal lobe, just above the ear became active in both players during attempts to communicate the rules of the game. Critically, the superior temporal gyrus of the right temporal lobe maintained a steady, baseline activity throughout the game but became more active when one player suddenly understood what the other player was trying to communicate. The brain's right hemisphere is more involved in abstract thought and social interactions than the left hemisphere. ""These regions in the right temporal lobe increase in activity the moment you establish a shared meaning for something, but not when you communicate a signal,"" Stolk said. ""The better the players got at understanding each other, the more active this region became."" This means that both players are building a similar conceptual framework in the same area of the brain, constantly testing one another to make sure their concepts align, and updating only when new information changes that mutual understanding. The results were reported in 2014 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""It is surprising,"" said Stolk, ""that for both the communicator, who has static input while she is planning her move, and the addressee, who is observing dynamic visual input during the game, the same region of the brain becomes more active over the course of the experiment as they improve their mutual understanding."" Robots and computers, on the other hand, converse based on a statistical analysis of a word's meaning, Stolk said. If you usually use the word ""bank"" to mean a place to cash a check, then that will be the assumed meaning in a conversation, even when the conversation is about fishing. ""Apple's Siri focuses on statistical regularities, but communication is not about statistical regularities,"" he said. ""Statistical regularities may get you far, but it is not how the brain does it. In order for computers to communicate with us, they would need a cognitive architecture that continuously captures and updates the conceptual space shared with their communication partner during a conversation."" Hypothetically, such a dynamic conceptual framework would allow computers to resolve the intrinsically ambiguous communication signals produced by a real person, including drawing upon information stored years earlier. Stolk's studies have pinpointed other brain areas critical to mutual understanding. In a 2014 study, he used brain stimulation to disrupt a rear portion of the temporal lobe and found that it is important for integrating incoming signals with knowledge from previous interactions. A later study found that in patients with damage to the frontal lobe (the ventromedial prefrontal cortex), decisions to communicate are no longer fine-tuned to stored knowledge about an addressee. Both studies could explain why such patients appear socially awkward in everyday social interactions. Stolk plans future studies with Knight using fine-tuned brain mapping on the actual surfaces of the brains of volunteers, so-called electrocorticography. Stolk said he wrote the new paper in hopes of moving the study of communication to a new level with a focus on conceptual alignment. ""Most cognitive neuroscientists focus on the signals themselves, on the words, gestures and their statistical relationships, ignoring the underlying conceptual ability that we use during communication and the flexibility of everyday life,"" he said. ""Language is very helpful, but it is a tool for communication, it is not communication per se. By focusing on language, you may be focusing on the tool, not on the underlying mechanism, the cognitive architecture we have in our brain that helps us to communicate.""

This is awarded by a Health Research Authority Research Ethics Committee (REC) and is the approval of the project s Protocol.  The new study will provide the data necessary for regulatory approval and registration of the company s Mcm5-ELISA test for the diagnosis of bladder cancer.  The study will commence in early 2016 and will involve 800 patients with haematuria, across at least five centres in the UK, making it the country s largest privately funded bladder cancer trial.  It will be led by Dr Stuart McCracken, Clinical Lecturer and Honorary Consultant Urologist, Newcastle University and Sunderland Royal Infirmary, and follows on from the recent successful screening trial involving 350 haematuria patients, which indicated the Mcm5-ELISA test has a Sensitivity of 83%, Specificity of 77% and Negative Predictive Value of 98%. Bladder cancer is currently diagnosed by cystoscopy, which is expensive and uncomfortable for patients.  Arquer s Mcm5-ELISA is a simple, non-invasive test, which detects the presence of minichromosome maintenance complex component 5 (Mcm5) protein in urine.  MCM proteins are shed into urine by both prostate and bladder tumours and are known to be excellent biomarkers of cancer, being directly involved in cell replication.  Arquer s diagnostic test originates from work conducted by Cambridge University and Cancer Research Technology (CRT), the development and commercialisation arm of Cancer Research UK, and has been improved significantly during the last couple of years by the Arquer team led by CEO, Dr Ian Campbell and Chairman, Dr Sandy Primrose. The new study will involve testing for the presence of MCM5 in the urine of 800 patients with haematuria.  The result of their MCM5 test will be compared with the outcome of their routine investigations, specifically whether their haematuria was caused by bladder cancer.  The aim is to show that the MCM5-ELISA can accurately distinguish between those patients with and without bladder cancer at a point prior to them undergoing invasive techniques such as cystoscopy. Dr Ian Campbell, CEO, Arquer Diagnostics, commented:  This is a pivotal study ahead of the commercial launch of Arquer s Mcm5-ELISA test.  Ultimately we aim to reduce the number of people without bladder cancer who have to undergo cystoscopy unnecessarily.  Cases of bladder cancer are increasing, and there is a need for a reliable up-front test that would enable earlier detection and diagnosis.  The Mcm5-ELISA test has the potential to provide patients with a simple and non-invasive solution for screening.  Dr Stuart McCracken, Principal Investigator, commented:  Almost 11,000 patients are diagnosed with bladder cancer in the UK each year, with only 53% surviving more than 5 years.  There is an urgent need to find and validate a novel and acceptable test that can help doctors to pick up bladder cancer at an early stage of the disease process, when currently available treatment options can improve survival rates.  I believe we may have found such a test, and am very excited to be collaborating on this study.  If successful, this simple, non-invasive urine test would be of benefit to both my patients and my fellow clinicians. ","Published: January 11, 2016"

Clinical trials are expected to start by third quarter of 2016. The HTI immunogen has the potential to become the first immunotherapy to produce a 'functional cure' for HIV infection. It works by eliciting an effective T-cell immune response to the virus in vaccinated individuals. It is estimated that more than 36.9 million people in the world are HIV-positive, with 2 million new cases in 2014.  We are delighted to have closed such an important equity round. The investment syndicate includes many complementary parties, specifically the corporate investors from pharmaceutical companies with expertise in virology and vaccine development. We also look forward to working with the research community to test this concept,  said Dr. Christian Brander, ICREA investigator at Irsicaixa and chief scientific officer and co-founder of Aelix Therapeutics.  We believe that Aelix s innovative approach, based on a disruptive design of a T-cell immunogen that is able to elicit a strong, broad and focused response against HIV, has the potential to radically transform the treatment of HIV infection, still one of the largest health problems in the world,  said Karen Wagner from Ysios Capital.  We were impressed by the science and the preclinical data supporting the HTI immunogen. We believe that this may indeed change the future of how HIV infection is treated and also help to improve the health of millions of people globally.   We are very proud that the quality of Drs. Brander, Clotet, Gatell and HIVACAT s scientific work for more than 20 years has attracted such a high caliber investor group,  said Jordi Naval, co-founder of Aelix Therapeutics and board director.  We look forward to working with them to build the company further and make Aelix a powerhouse for HIV therapeutics.   HIV still has a high-unmet medical need, even in the western world. Achieving a functional cure would allow people living with HIV to discontinue anti-retroviral therapy and thereby ease the overall burden on treatment and healthcare systems, as well as reduce the social stigma associated with daily medication,  said Jos  Antonio Mesa, from Caixa Capital Risc.  We are proud to continue the work done for years by Obra Social 'la Caixa', turning IrsiCaixa into a pioneering center where highly innovative projects such as Aelix are developed.

New research by Stanford biologists suggests that this lucky outcome is regulated at a genetic level, by turning genes on and off. People generally think that our genetic code, and thus the expression patterns of our genes, is fixed throughout life. Indeed, this is true in some cases such as eye color, a characteristic that is determined by gene expression early in development. However, scientists have recently found that gene regulation can also happen in an ongoing fashion through epigenetic processes, with the potential to change behavior throughout a lifetime. Through epigenetics, gene expression can be turned on and off like a light switch via several mechanisms. Through one of these mechanisms called DNA methylation, methyl molecules are added to genes, preventing them from being expressed. In a recently published study researchers from Stanford report that social status in cichlid fish may be regulated by DNA methylation.  ""Status differences exist in all social organisms,"" said Russell Fernald, a biology professor at Stanford University and senior author of the study. ""Our work reveals how social dominance status is possibly regulated through methylation, which is important because individuals higher in rank generally enjoy better health and quality of life."" A show of social dominance In 2004, a study by researchers at McGill University showed that the nurturing behavior of mother rats affected their offspring. Pups that were nurtured more grew up to be less stressed as adults, while pups that received less nurturing grew up with more anxious tendencies. This difference was caused by methylation of a gene for a stress receptor, explained Fernald, the Benjamin Scott Crocker Professor of Human Biology. Subsequent research has revealed other examples through which epigenetics can alter our gene expression patterns by experiences during our lifetimes. Fernald studies Astatotilapia burtoni, one of the hundreds of cichlid fish species inhabiting Lake Tanganyika in eastern Africa, because of the unique ways they have evolved over time. For male A. burtoni, dominance is everything. They battle frequently for territory, with the victor winning access to the two most important resources   food and females. Sporting bright rainbow-colored scales, high-ranking males aggressively defend their foraging grounds and lure females into their territory to dine on decaying matter on the lakebed. In contrast, the low-ranking males, which are dull grey in color, comprise 80 percent of the population but cannot reproduce and must swim with the females to get access to food. But even the dominant males must fool the females into mating. This is tricky, as A. burtoni are mouth-brooders. After laying eggs in the sand, the female scoops them up in her mouth to brood them until hatching, which poses a logistical challenge for fertilization. The ingenious evolutionary solution to this dilemma is a version of oral sex. The dominant male flashes his anal fin, which is adorned with spots that look like enormous eggs, and which are laced with sperm. When the female sees those spots, she goes after the male's anal fin as if trying to collect some eggs she dropped, collecting sperm in the process and fertilizing the eggs in her mouth. ""In this species, only the macho males get to mate and non-dominant males cannot reproduce, so the stakes are enormously high,"" Fernald said. Changing social status  But some social mobility is possible. Because the flashy dominant males are more vulnerable to predation, whenever a boss fish disappears, a major battle ensues as non-dominant males fight to take over the vacant territory. The winner then ascends to dominant status resulting in an astonishing series of physiological changes, including rewiring of parts of the brain as previously reported by Fernald's group. Given the importance of status, Fernald wondered whether these dramatic changes were driven by gene expression. ""If we altered gene expression through changes in methylation, could we influence change in social dominance?"" he asked. With a graduate student, Kapa Lenkov, Fernald tested this directly in cichlids raised in his Stanford lab. Several pairs of non-dominant males matched in size were each placed in an aquarium that could support only one territory. In each pair, one male was injected with a methylating agent while the other received a methylation suppressor, and the two fish fought for dominance.  ""We could see the behavioral change in a matter of minutes, as one animal began to dominate the other,"" Fernald said. ""Videos of these confrontations showed that the fish injected with the methylating agent were much more likely to be the winners, while those receiving the methylation suppressor typically lost the fight for dominance. ""It was remarkable that we could determine which fish became dominant by changing the range of genes expressed in this context,"" he said. Fernald's work suggests that epigenetic processes may cause, rather than simply reflect, changes in dominance status in hierarchically organized species, said Tom Boyce, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study. ""This has implications for humans and nonhuman primates, since hierarchical behavior and social dominance relations appear early in life and remain important throughout the lifespan,"" Boyce said. ""DNA methylation is potentially a way through which social dominance is regulated in many social organisms, including people,"" Fernald said. ""The next step will be to identify which genes are responding to methylation in causing this change in dominance.""","Published: January 11, 2016"

Whether through ingestion, mud baths, or as a way to stop bleeding from wounds, clay has long helped keep humans healthy. Scientists have found that certain clays possess germ-killing abilities, but how these work has remained unclear. A new discovery by Arizona State University (ASU) scientists shows that two specific metallic elements in the right kinds of clay can kill disease-causing bacteria that infect humans and animals. ""The novelty of this research is two-fold: identifying the natural environment of the formation of clays toxic to bacteria, and how the chemistry of these clays attacks and destroys the bacteria,"" says Enriqueta Barrera, a program director in the National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Earth Sciences, which funded the research. ""This geochemical mechanism can be used to develop products that act on bacteria resistant to antibiotic treatment."" An antibacterial Trojan horse ""We think of this mechanism like the Trojan horse attack in ancient Greece,"" says Lynda Williams, a clay-mineral scientist at ASU. ""Two elements in the clay work in tandem to kill bacteria."" She explains that ""one metallic element -- chemically reduced iron, which in small amounts is required by a bacterial cell for nutrition -- tricks the cell into opening its wall. Then another element, aluminum, props the cell wall open, allowing a flood of iron to enter the cell. This overabundance of iron then poisons the cell, killing it as the reduced iron becomes oxidized."" Adds scientist Keith Morrison of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, ""It's like putting a nail in the coffin of the dead bacteria."" Morrison is the lead author of a paper reporting the discovery, published today in the journal Nature Scientific Reports. Williams and Rajeev Misra, a microbiologist at ASU, are co-authors. From French green clay to Oregon blue clay A chance discovery of a medicinal clay from Europe caught Williams' attention and put her on track for the recent discovery. Line Brunet de Courssou, a philanthropist with clinical medicine experience in Africa, passed along information about a particular green-hued clay found near her childhood home in France. Brunet de Courssou had taken samples of the clay to Africa, where she documented its ability to cure Buruli ulcer, a flesh-eating skin disease, for patients in Ivory Coast. Williams attempted to locate the site of the green clay deposit in the French Massif Central region. When the search proved unsuccessful, she began systematically testing clays sold online as ""healing clays."" After analyzing dozens of samples, Williams and her team identified a blue-colored clay from the Oregon Cascades that proved to be highly antibacterial. The research shows that it works against a broad spectrum of human pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The colors of the clays reflect their origins, Williams says. Greens and blues are antibacterial clues The greens and blues of antibacterial clays come from having a high content of chemically reduced iron, as opposed to oxidized iron, which provides the familiar rust color associated with many clays. Such ""reduced"" clays are common in many parts of the world, typically forming in volcanic ash layers as rocks become altered by water that is oxygen-deprived and hydrogen-rich. Because blue and green clays abound in nature, Williams says, the discovery of how their antibacterial action works should lead to alternative ways of treating persistent infections and diseases that are difficult to treat with antibiotics. ""Finding out how natural clays kill human pathogens,"" she says, ""may lead to new economic uses of such clays and to new drug designs.""","Published: January 11, 2016"

The nanoflasks, which have a span of several nanometers, or millionths of a millimeter, can accelerate chemical reactions for research. In the future, they might facilitate the manufacture of various industrial materials and perhaps even serve as vehicles for drug delivery. Dr. Rafal Klajn of the Weizmann Institute's Organic Chemistry Department and his team were originally studying the light-induced self-assembly of nanoparticles. They were employing a method earlier developed by Klajn in which inorganic nanoparticles are coated in a single layer of organic molecules that change their configuration when exposed to light; these alter the properties of the nanoparticles such that they self-assemble into crystalline clusters. When spherical nanoparticles of gold or other materials self-assembled into a cluster, empty spaces formed between them, like those between oranges packed in a case. Klajn and his team members realized that the empty spaces sometimes trapped water molecules, which led them to suggest that they could also trap ""guest"" molecules of other materials and function as tiny flasks for chemical reactions. A cluster of a million nanoparticles would contain a million such nanoflasks. When the scientists trapped molecules that tend to react with one another inside the nanoflasks, they found that the chemical reaction ran a hundred times faster than the same reaction taking place in solution. Being confined inside the nanoflasks greatly increased the concentration of the molecules and organized them in a way that caused them to react more readily. Enzymes speed up chemical reactions in a similar manner - by confining the reacting molecules within a pocket. Although clusters of nanoparticles containing empty spaces have been created before, the advantage of the Weizmann Institute method is that the clusters are dynamic and reversible, so molecules can be inserted and released on demand. The clusters self-assemble when nanoparticles are exposed to ultraviolet light, but exposure to regular light causes them to disassemble, so that the same nanoparticles can be reused in numerous cycles. Moreover, the scientists found that by decorating their nanoparticles with a mixture of different chemicals, they could trap molecules inside the nanoflasks in a highly selective manner. For example, from a mixture of spiral-shaped molecules, they could cause left- or right-handed spirals to be trapped, a skill that can be particularly important for drug synthesis. For future industrial use, the nanoflasks may prove useful in speeding up numerous chemical reactions, such as polymerization reactions needed for the manufacture of plastics. The method might also be applied one day in drug delivery. The drug would be delivered inside nanoflasks to the target organ and released at the required time when the nanoflasks would disassemble upon exposure to light.","Published: January 11, 2016"

A research team at the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute focused on inherited retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease with no known cure that can lead to blindness. The researchers used a technique known as CRISPR/Cas9 to remove a genetic mutation that causes the blindness disease. CRISPR/Cas9 is adapted from a strategy used by bacteria to fight invading viruses. Although the study involved rats, it is an important milestone because of its potential implications for humans. ""Our data show that with further development, it may be possible to use this gene-editing technique to treat inherited retinitis pigmentosa in patients,"" said Shaomei Wang, MD, PhD, a research scientist in the institute's Eye Program and associate professor of Biomedical Sciences. Wang was the senior author of the study. Retinitis pigmentosa is a class of diseases in which patients experience night blindness in the early stages, along with atrophy and pigment changes in the retina, constriction of the visual field and eventual blindness, according to the National Institutes of Health. While rare overall, it is one of the most common inherited diseases of the retina, affecting about 1 in 4,000 people in the U.S. and Europe. CRISPR/Cas9, the technique that Cedars-Sinai scientists used to target retinitis pigmentosa, has been in use by genetic researchers for less than five years. In that time, it has transformed the science of genome editing by making the process easier, more dependable and less expensive. The technique is adapted from a system that bacteria deploy to disable invading viruses. The bacteria first copy part of the invader's genetic code into a special sequence of ribonucleic acid (RNA), which acts a messenger to carry out the code's instructions. When the virus returns, the RNA binds to a protein called Cas9, guiding it to the matching gene in the virus. The protein disables the gene. By modifying this system, scientists can program Cas9 to turn selected genes on or off, or rewrite the genetic code. (CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat, the type of DNA sequences involved in this process.) In the study, the Cedars-Sinai researchers designed a CRISPR/Cas9 system to remove a mutated gene that causes photoreceptor cell loss in the eye. They injected this system into young laboratory rats that had been engineered to model a type of inherited retinitis pigmentosa known as autosomal dominant, which involves this mutated gene. After a single injection, the rats were able to see better compared with controls, as measured by optomotor reflex, which involves turning the head in response to moving stripes of varying degrees of brightness. Clive Svendsen, PhD, a co-author on the study, said the effectiveness and consistency of these results may be improved by modifying elements of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and using new viral delivery techniques. In the future, after more research, he believes that reliable genome editing through this system may provide a means to correct a wide range of inherited diseases in patients. ""This is the first time CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing has been used to prevent vision loss in a living animal. It is a truly remarkable result and paves the way for more exciting studies and translation to the clinic in the future,"" said Svendsen, director of the Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute and the Kerry and Simone Vickar Family Foundation Distinguished Chair in Regenerative Medicine.","Published: January 11, 2016"

However, more recently researchers have discovered that sources from within the cell itself can sometimes be even more damaging. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is found in the nucleus of every cell. It is the code for the traits we have as human beings, and it serves as the warehouse of information needed to make a cell work. When something goes wrong with DNA, it can lead to a mutation and changes in the cell, and can sometimes lead to disease.In a study the team   led by J. Lucas Argueso, CSU assistant professor and Boettcher Investigator in the Department of Environmental & Radiological Health Sciences   found that RNA, or ribonucleic acid, has a new and important part in this process. CSU researchers worked in close in collaboration with scientists from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in North Carolina. RNA is a molecule that plays a central role in the function of genes. It is the  business  end of a genome. The building blocks that cells use for making RNA are knows as ribonucleotides, which was the focus of the research paper.  You don t hear as much about RNA, but cells actually have much more RNA than DNA,  Argueso said. Cells also have more ribonucleotides than deoxyribonucleotides, the building blocks for making DNA. Since the two are chemically very similar, it is quite common for cells to mistakenly incorporate RNA pieces into DNA. Argueso and his team   including Hailey Conover, Ph.D. student in Cell & Molecular Biology and lead author of the study, and Deborah Afonso Cornelio, a post-doctoral researcher   are looking at what happens to yeast cells when they are unable to accurately remove RNA from DNA.  The same problem happens in humans, carrots, butterflies, and yeast cells, the model organism used in our lab,  Argueso said.  The same yeast that is used to bake bread and to brew beer is an incredibly useful biomedical research model.  Findings from this study have direct implications for children with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, a devastating disorder that affects the brain, the immune system and the skin.  This is a very serious disease that affects children born without a critical enzyme that removes the RNA building blocks from DNA,  Argueso said.  Our model yeast cells have been engineered to have the same basic genetic defect as Aicardi-Goutieres children so that we can investigate this problem at its very core.  Future studies focus on cancer research What s next for the team? Argueso said they want to extend their work to cancer research. The team wants to determine how ribonucleotides increase chromosome abnormalities and whether those increases are asymmetric, depending on which of the two strands of DNA the ribonucleotides are introduced. Most cancers have some form of alteration in chromosomal structure, though Argueso said that breast and ovarian cancers are by far the most affected by this issue. In addition, with some forms of chemotherapy that have been used for a long time, the mechanism of action is to decrease the production of DNA building blocks.  Cancer cells reproduce quickly,  Argueso said.  To do that, the cells need DNA building blocks. Chemotherapy is used to decrease the building blocks. However, when you reduce the number of DNA building blocks, you push the cancer cells into a corner, where they end up putting in more RNA building blocks into the DNA.  In other words, the very thing that the chemotherapy agent is encouraging cancer cells to incorporate causes them to acquire even more mutations. This could help explain why cancers often recur in more aggressive forms after someone goes into remission.  This unintended consequence could be one of the mechanisms making that happen,  Argueso said.","Published: January 11, 2016"

The study  focuses on a protein called nucleophosmin (NPM1). This protein has many functions and, when mutated, has been shown to interfere with cells  normal tumor-suppressing ability. NPM1 has been implicated in cancers such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute myelogenous leukemia. Previous research led by study collaborators Kriwacki and Diana Mitrea at St. Jude had shown that a section of NPM1, called the N-terminal domain (Npm-N), doesn t have a defined, folded structure. Instead, the protein morphs between two forms: a one-subunit disordered monomer and a five-subunit folded pentamer. Until now, the mechanism behind this transformation was unknown, but scientists believed this monomer-pentamer equilibrium could be important for the protein s location and functioning in the cell. To shed light on how this transformation occurred, Deniz and his colleagues used an innovative combination of three techniques single-molecule biophysics, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and circular dichroism which enabled them to study individual molecules and collections of molecules. Single-molecule methods are especially useful for such studies because they can uncover important information that remains hidden in conventional studies. Remarkably, the researchers found that the transformation can proceed through more than one pathway. In one pathway, the transformation begins when the cell sends signals to attach phosphoryl groups to NPM1. This modification, called phosphorylation, prompts the ordered pentamer to become disordered and likely causes NPM1 to shuttle outside the cell s nucleus. A meeting with a binding partner can mediate the reverse transformation to a pentamer. Interestingly, when NPM1 does become a pentamer again under these conditions, which likely causes it to move back to the nucleolus, it takes a different path instead of just retracing its earlier steps. Priya Banerjee, an American Heart Association-supported postdoctoral research associate at TSRI and the first author of the study, compared these complicated transitions to the morphing of a  Transformers  toy, where a robot can become a car and then a jet.  Phosphorylation and partner-binding are like different cellular switches driving these changes,  said Banerjee. Banerjee said the new study also reveals many intermediate states between monomer and pentamer structures and that these states can be manipulated or  tuned  by changing conditions such as salt levels, phosphorylation and partner binding, which may explain how cells regulate the protein s multiple functions. The researchers said future studies could shed more light on the biological functions of these different structures and how they might be used in future cancer therapies. The researchers added that combining the three techniques used in this study, plus a novel protein-labeling technique for single-molecule fluorescence, could be a useful strategy for studying other unstructured,  intrinsically disordered proteins  (IDPS). IDPS are involved in a host of cellular functions, as well as neurodegenerative disease, heart disease, infectious disease, type 2 diabetes and other conditions.","Published: January 11, 2016"

Volunteers in their online program, Mark2Cure, read sections of scientific studies to identify important terms.  If you can read, you can help,  explained TSRI Associate Professor Andrew Su, leader of Mark2Cure, in a presentation at Stanford University s recent Big Data in Biomedicine 2015 conference. With about 1 million biomedical studies published every year, it s impossible for scientists to keep track of all new developments. Search engines can track down specific words and phrases, but they can fail to find the obvious (to the human brain) connections between terms such as  disorders of metabolism  and  metabolic disorders.  Now, Mark2Cure volunteers, called Mark2Curators, are on the job, sorting through studies to find the needles in the haystacks. Their work could point to new therapies for rare but devastating diseases. Meet the Volunteers Anyone can be a Mark2Curator. Some are high school students, others are engineers. Some are retirees curious about research, others are members of the rare disease community.  We are all learning,  said Judy Eckhart, a retired nursing professor who became a Mark2Curator in early 2015, along with her husband, AJ Eckhart. Judy Eckhart explained that she and AJ wanted to find a philanthropic cause to support, and Mark2Cure was a good fit since they re both curious about science.  This is an easy way to contribute because you can do it from your home in your jammies!  said Judy Eckhart.  It has been quite fun,  added AJ Eckhart, a retired engineer. Volunteers like the Eckharts are doing the job well, said Su. Even when a volunteer marks a wrong answer, their results are checked against other Mark2Curator answers, and the right answer comes out when the answers are averaged together.  When combined, our volunteers' answers are as good as the answers we get from professional scientists who do this for a living,  said Su. Ginger Tsueng, scientific outreach project manager for Mark2Cure, said the senior and retiree communities have been especially active on Mark2Cure, and she sees this as a potential win-win, since preliminary studies have shown that daily mental exercise seems to protect against Alzheimer s and other age-related dementias.  This is a good way to keep your brain working,  said Tsueng. Hope for Rare Diseases Su, Tsueng and their colleagues realized early on that Mark2Cure could be empowering for patients and families dealing with rare diseases. They have worked with Mark2Curators on diseases such as Hashimoto s encephalitis, cystic fibrosis and cystinosis. These diseases are devastating, but they affect fewer people than heart disease, for example, so they receive less attention from the research community and funding groups. One Mark2Curator from the rare disease community is Stephanie Johnson. Johnson is diagnosed with Reidels invasive fibrosis, a disease that causes chronic pain and requires weekly infusions that destroy her immune system. Johnson learned about Mark2Cure from a Twitter user in May 2015 and has been contributing to the project whenever she feels well enough.  Mark2Cure gave me a lifeline and a purpose to focus on something other than my disease,  explained Johnson. Much of the work so far has focused on proteins related to an extremely rare genetic disorder called NGLY1. Children born with NGLY1 lack an enzyme needed to recycle misfolded proteins, which appear to accumulate in the cells of patients. Symptoms of the disease include developmental delays, liver dysfunction and seizures. In September, thanks to the Mark2Curators, Su s team assembled a network revealing connections between the disease and a hormone called ACTH. When they ran their findings past leaders in the NGLY1 community, they found that ACTH, in fact, had even been tested in at least one patient as a treatment for NGLY1 (although it proved to have harmful side effects). This demonstrated the potential of Mark2Cure volunteers who reviewed and marked scientific papers really could help researchers find the connections they couldn t see before.  It was really exciting, and we got feedback from curators who were very excited, too,  said Tsueng.  The highlight for me has been working with the team at Mark2Cure,  said AJ Eckhart.  They really care about what they re doing.  Eventually, scientists will use the data from Mark2Cure to train computer programs to better connect research terms, but today, curious, dedicated humans can play a critical role in tracking down treatments for diseases such as NGLY1. In fact, the Mark2Cure team plans to let the hard-working Mark2Curators decide which disease to tackle after NGLY1. Su said the next version of Mark2Cure will also allow volunteers to explicitly identify the nature of the relationships between biomedical concepts, a task where the difference between humans and computers is even greater.  We need the help of thousands of people,  said Su.  We want to throw the kitchen sink at it. ","Published: January 11, 2016"

""A large amount of GTP is required in rapidly dividing cells, and cells need to know that the fuel is available to them. If we can interfere with the ability of PI5P4K  to sense fuel availability and communicate that information, we may be able to slow or halt the growth of cancers, including the aggressive brain cancer glioblastoma multiforme and cancers that have metastasized to the brain.  The publication is Sasaki's first to address PI5P4K  as a molecular sensor of GTP concentration. Initially, he and his team faced skepticism regarding the existence of GTP energy-sensing; however, with a pilot grant funded by Cincinnati s Walk Ahead for a Brain Tumor Cure and other local sources, the researchers were able to pursue their high-risk research and acquire enough promising data to earn a five-year, $1.67 million grant from the National Institutes of Health in 2014.  ""The publication in Molecular Cell is another milestone for Atsuo Sasaki and the UC Brain Tumor Center,  says Ronald Warnick, MD, medical director of the Brain Tumor Center and the John M. Tew, Jr., Chair in Neurosurgical Oncology. ""The seeds of this discovery, which were planted locally by friends of the UC Brain Tumor Center and nourished by federal tax dollars, are now bearing their first fruit as we gain a better understanding of cancer s energy mechanisms.  GTP guanosine triphosphate is one of two energy molecules used by cells. The other is ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP handles the bulk of a cell s energy requirements, while GTP is required for protein synthesis and is a signaling molecule that helps direct processes within the cell. When GTP levels are increased and utilized as fuel by rampaging cancer cells, its ability to perform its primary goals is compromised. Sasaki and his team identified PI5P4K  as a GTP sensor by demonstrating, in a laboratory setting, its ability to bind to GTP and by demonstrating, at the atomic level by X-ray structural analysis, the molecular mechanism by which it recognizes GTP. They then designed PI5P4K  mutant cells that were unable to sense GTP concentration and, as a result, impaired the ability of PI5P4K  to promote tumor growth. His next step is to use both pharmacological and molecular approaches that target PI5P4K  in a cell culture and in animal tumor models.  ""By unveiling PI5P4K s role as a GTP sensor, we now have a potential new therapeutic target for patients,  Sasaki says. ""If we can find drugs that stop PI5P4K  from acting as the fuel indicator, we could get these aggressive and tragic cancers into energy-depleted status. ","Published: January 11, 2016"

It was originally thought that Alzheimer s disease disturbs the brain s immune response, but this latest study adds to evidence that inflammation in the brain can in fact drive the development of the disease. The findings suggest that by reducing this inflammation, progression of the disease could be halted. The team hope the discovery will lead to an effective new treatment for the disease, for which there is currently no cure. The researchers at the University of Southampton used tissue samples from healthy brains and those with Alzheimer s, both of the same age. The researchers counted the numbers of a particular type of immune cell, known as microglia, in the samples and found that these were more numerous in the brains with Alzheimer s disease. In addition, the activity of the molecules regulating the numbers of microglia correlated with the severity of the disease. The researchers then studied these same immune cells in mice which had been bred to develop features of Alzheimer s. They wanted to find out whether blocking the receptor responsible for regulating microglia, known as CSF1R, could improve cognitive skills. They gave the mice oral doses of an inhibitor that blocks CSF1R and found that it could prevent the rise in microglia numbers seen in untreated mice as the disease progressed. In addition, the inhibitor prevented the loss of communication points between the nerve cells in the brain associated with Alzheimer s, and the treated mice demonstrated fewer memory and behavioural problems compared with the untreated mice. Importantly, the team found the healthy number of microglia needed for normal immune function in the brain was maintained, suggesting the blocking of CSF1R only reduces excess microglia. What the study did not find is a correlated reduction of the number of amyloid plaques in the brain, a characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease. This supports previous studies that argue other factors may play more of role in cognitive decline. Dr Diego Gomez-Nicola, lead author of the study and an MRC New Investigator Research Grant (NIRG) fellow at the University of Southampton, said:  These findings are as close to evidence as we can get to show that this particular pathway is active in the development of Alzheimer s disease.  The next step is to work closely with our partners in industry to find a safe and suitable drug that can be tested to see if it works in humans.  Dr Rob Buckle, Director of Science Programmes at the MRC, added:  It is increasingly clear that inflammation is a key factor in a number of neurodegenerative conditions and this study provides an important insight into the biological processes behind this link.  The study is an excellent example of how basic research can lead to promising partnerships with industry that could be of real benefit for those with dementia.  Dr Simon Ridley, Director of Research at Alzheimer s Research UK, said:  This work, looking at the role of the immune system in Alzheimer s disease, suggests that blocking the action of the CSF1R protein in mice could help limit the damaging effects of inflammation and protect against symptoms like memory loss. In the last few years, scientists in Southampton have been at the forefront of research into the role of the immune system in Alzheimer s, so it is encouraging to see this study taking these ideas forward by identifying a specific mechanism that could be a target for future treatments.  Alzheimer s Research UK is delighted to be supporting the next phase of this work as the researchers seek to build on these findings and develop drugs that could block the action of CSF1R in people. Research like this is vital as there are currently no treatments that can stop or slow the progression of Alzheimer s in the brain. We desperately need to see greater investment in research, if we are to find new ways to help the tens of thousands of people who develop Alzheimer s in this country every year.  Dr Gomez-Nicola and his colleagues at the University of Southampton will continue their work with funding from the Dementia Consortium.

""This research is valuable to the scientific community as it bridges genetic and environmental factors and helps to illustrate one possible route to ADHD. Further, it demonstrates the potential to ultimately prevent conditions like ADHD by understanding how genes and environmental exposures combine,"" says lead researcher Joel Nigg, professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) School of Medicine. See Also: Inside the adult ADHD brain To conduct this research, Nigg and colleagues evaluated lead blood level in 386 healthy children aged 6 to 17. Half of the children had been carefully diagnosed with ADHD. All children were within the safe lead exposure range as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the blood lead level in the sample was typical of the national US population of children. The analysis showed a heightened association between lead exposure and ADHD symptoms particularly hyperactivity-impulsivity in those with the HFE C282Y gene mutation, present in approximately 10 percent of US children. ""Because the C282Y gene helps to control the effects of lead in the body and the mutation was spread randomly in the children, the findings of our study are difficult to explain unless lead is, in fact, part of the cause of ADHD, not just an association,"" explained Nigg. The study also found that lead effects were more robust in males, which is consistent with previous research specific to neurodevelopmental conditions and gender. Children without HFE C282Y mutations showed amplified symptoms as lead exposure increased, but not as consistently. The scientists do not purport that lead is the only cause of ADHD symptoms, nor does the research indicate that lead exposure will guarantee an ADHD diagnosis; rather, the study demonstrates that environmental pollutants, such as lead, do play a role in the explanation of ADHD. Despite US government regulations that drastically reduced environmental exposure to lead, the neurotoxin is still found in common objects such as children's toys and costume jewelry, and continues to be ingested in small amounts via water from aging pipes, as well as contaminated soil and dust. ""Our findings put scientists one step closer to understanding this complex disorder so that we may provide better clinical diagnoses and treatment options and, eventually, learn to prevent it,"" says Nigg.

In a specially-designed insect cinema, they have shown that it needs to be 'old school' 3D glasses for tests to work on mantises. While in humans that would be with red and blue lenses, red light is poorly visible to mantises so they have custom-made glasses with one blue and one green lens! Yes, this is a mantis in glasses. Mantises have poor vision in red light and had to have special blue and green lenses made. The mantis here is modelling green and blue lenses attached with beeswax. Credit: Newcastle University  3D vision in mantises was originally shown in the 1980s by Samuel Rossel, but his work used prisms and occluders which meant that only a very limited set of images could be shown. The Newcastle University team has developed 3D glasses suitable for insects which means they can show the insects any images they want, opening up new avenues of research. See Also: Animal-eye view of the world revealed with new visual software Study leader, Jenny Read, Professor of Vision Science who is supported by the Leverhulme Trust said:  Despite their minute brains, mantises are sophisticated visual hunters which can capture prey with terrifying efficiency. We can learn a lot by studying how they perceive the world.  Better understanding of their simpler processing systems helps us understand how 3D vision evolved, and could lead to possible new algorithms for 3D depth perception in computers."" In the experiments, mantises fitted with tiny glasses attached with beeswax were shown short videos of simulated bugs moving around a computer screen. The mantises didn t try to catch the bugs when they were in 2D. But when the bugs were shown in 3D, apparently floating in front of the screen, the mantises struck out at them. This shows that mantises do indeed use 3D vision. Initial testing of the most widely-used contemporary 3D technology used for humans using circular polarization to separate the two eyes  images didn t work because the insects were so close to the screen that the glasses failed to separate the two eyes  images correctly. Dr Vivek Nityananda, sensory biologist at Newcastle University and part of the research team continues: ""When this system failed we looked at the old-style 3D glasses with red and blue lenses. Since red light is poorly visible to mantises, we used green and blue glasses and an LED monitor with unusually narrow output in the green and blue wavelength.  We definitively demonstrated 3D vision or stereopsis in mantises and also showed that this technique can be effectively used to deliver virtual 3D stimuli to insects.""

Published online in the journal Neuron, the findings provide not only a new mechanistic explanation for microcephaly, but they could also aid understanding of autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders that are thought to arise from disruptions in the proper balance of neurons in the brain.  This study shows that the time it takes for a stem cell to divide matters during brain development,  said Debra Silver, an assistant professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at the Duke University School of Medicine.  But beyond microcephaly, I think it s going to be relevant for thinking about how stem cell dysfunction can change the repertoire of other cells in the body.  Microcephaly is a rare disease that causes intellectual disability and seizures. A genetic form of microcephaly manifests as the fetal brain develops during pregnancy; the cerebral cortex, a large brain structure responsible for abstract thought, memory and language, is particularly vulnerable to the disorder.  In 2010, Silver s group discovered that mice missing a single copy of a gene called Magoh have severely reduced brain size reminiscent of genetic microcephaly in people.  At the time, we really didn t know why,  said Silver, who is also a member of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences. The group zeroed in on neural stem cells which divide to form either a new stem cell or the beginning of a new neuron cell. The 2010 study found that the number of neural stem cells seemed out of balance with the number of neurons being produced in the Magoh-deficient brains.  The researchers suspected that the time it takes for one stem cell to divide into two during mitosis could be responsible for the imbalance. Other microcephaly-linked genes are known to control mitosis. But how mitosis defects caused microcephaly was unknown. In the new study, Silver s team found that about 30% of the stem cells in mice lacking Magoh took longer in some cases two or three times longer than usual to divide.  As scientists watched those cells using cutting-edge live imaging techniques, they were surprised to see that the sluggish stem cells tended to differentiate into neurons, and were also more likely to die.  It s really a combination that helps explain the microcephaly,  Silver said.  On one hand, you re really not making enough new stem cells, and if you don t have enough stem cells you can t make enough neurons in the brain. On the other hand, some neurons do get made, but a lot of them die.  Silver s team saw similar results (premature differentiation and death) when they extended the process of cell division in genetically normal mice using two different drugs. And further experiments suggest that both differentiation and death are distinct outcomes of the delayed stem cells, Silver said. Magoh is a protein that switches on the expression of many other important genes but it does not work alone. In fact, previous research has linked Magoh s partners in gene regulation to other neurodevelopmental diseases. The Duke team is now planning large-scale screening approaches to ask what other genetic pathways influence the decision point when a delayed stem cell makes a neuron. Silver s team is also exploring cell division in healthy brain development and has some preliminary data suggesting that timing matters. Studies published more than a decade ago show that mitosis takes increasingly longer as brain development progresses.  We have a really nice experimental system in place to ask about whether that could help to explain why more neurons are made as development proceeds,  Silver said.

Davey recently won a silver medal in the undergraduate section of the National Inventors Hall of Fame s Collegiate Inventors Competition for his research project,  Early Cancer Diagnosis by the Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells using Drop-based Microfluidics.  His technique involves injecting a tiny amount of blood into a microfluidic device to encapsulate single cells from the blood stream in individual microfluidic drops. Once the cells have been encapsulated, Davey uses a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a common technique in molecular biology, to target and amplify fragments of cancer DNA within the drops. By linking DNA amplification to a fluorescent output, he can shine a laser onto the drops to detect and quantify brightness, which would indicate the presence of cancer DNA in a circulating tumor cell. Davey developed this technique in the lab of mentor David Weitz, Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and Applied Physics at the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.  The advantage of this technology is that it is ultra-sensitive, so I can detect as few as one cancer cell from a billion normal cells in the blood,  he said.  The process is also very specific. One can uniquely detect a wide range of cancers using this DNA amplification technology.  Davey worked in the lab of mentor of David Weitz, Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and Applied Physics at the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, to develop the technique. The technique could hold huge implications in the world of cancer diagnostics, which currently relies primarily on invasive and dangerous tumor biopsies. Microfluidics is much easier and cheaper than traditional methods, since the test uses only tiny amounts of reagents and takes 30 to 60 minutes to complete. The technology is currently about 90 percent accurate, but that accuracy can be improved if the test is refined to target more genes of the cancer cell, Davey said.  Because this technology is in an engineering platform, it is pretty universal. We tested the platform itself on prostate cancer and colorectal cancer, but it can be used on any disease, as well,  he said. Davey, who developed an interest in biology while working as a high school intern at the Food and Drug Administration, is looking forward to studying additional applications of microfluidics. The technology can be used to isolate specific cancer genomes by sorting bright drops out of the mix, enabling scientists to learn more about the nature of the disease. It can also be used to identify specific mutations of the cancer genome, which could help doctors determine which medications would be most effective for a patient. For Davey, who recently declared an economics concentration with a secondary field in statistics, the opportunity to use his knowledge to potentially improve the lives of cancer patients has been extremely rewarding.  The coolest thing about this project is that it is so interdisciplinary, involving biology, medicine, and engineering,  he said.  Looking downstream, we could someday use this technique to provide much more personalized cancer treatment. ","Published: January 8, 2016"

Five years ago, after  tzi s genome was completely deciphered, it seemed that the wellspring of spectacular discoveries about the past would soon dry up. An international team of scientists working with paleopathologist Albert Zink and microbiologist Frank Maixner from the European Academy (EURAC) in Bozen/Bolzano have now succeeded in demonstrating the presence of Helicobacter pylori in  tzi s stomach contents, a bacterium found in half of all humans today. The theory that humans were already infected with this stomach bacterium at the very beginning of their history could well be true. The scientists succeeded in decoding the complete genome of the bacterium.  When EURAC s Zink and Maixner first placed samples from the Iceman s stomach under the microscope in their ancient DNA Lab at EURAC, almost three years ago, they were initially sceptical.  Evidence for the presence of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is found in the stomach tissue of patients today, so we thought it was extremely unlikely that we would find anything because  tzi s stomach mucosa is no longer there,  explains Zink. Together with colleagues from the Universities of Kiel, Vienna and Venda in South Africa as well as the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, the scientists tried to find a new way to proceed.  We were able to solve the problem once we hit upon the idea of extracting the entire DNA of the stomach contents,  reports Maixner.  After this was successfully done, we were able to tease out the individual Helicobacter sequences and reconstruct a 5,300 year old Helicobacter pylori genome.  The scientists found a potentially virulent strain of bacteria, to which  tzi s immune system had already reacted.  We showed the presence of marker proteins which we see today in patients infected with Helicobacter,  said the microbiologist.  A tenth of infected people develop further clinical complications, such as gastritis or stomach ulcers, mostly in old age.  Whether  tzi suffered from stomach problems cannot be said with any degree of certainty,  says Zink,  because his stomach tissue has not survived and it is in this tissue that such diseases can be discerned first. Nonetheless, the preconditions for such a disease did in fact exist in  tzi.    After completing their stomach biopsy, the two EURAC scientists transferred the genome data for analysis by their colleague Thomas Rattei from the University of Vienna. Rattei, in collaboration with geneticists from the USA, South Africa and Germany, came to a surprising conclusion:    We had assumed that we would find the same strain of Helicobacter in  tzi as is found in Europeans today,  explains the computational biologist.  It turned out to be a strain that is mainly observed in Central and South Asia today.  The scientists assume that there were originally two strain types of the bacterium, an African and an Asian one, which at some point recombined into today s European version. Since bacteria are usually transmitted within the family, the history of the world s population is closely linked to the history of bacteria. Up till now, it had been assumed that Neolithic humans were already carrying this European strain by the time they stopped their nomadic life and took up agriculture. Research on  tzi, however, demonstrates that this was not the case.    The recombination of the two types of Helicobacter may have only occurred at some point after  tzi s era, and this shows that the history of settlements in Europe is much more complex than previously assumed,  says Maixner.   Further studies will be needed to show to what extent these bacteria living inside the human body can help us understand how humans developed. The current investigations, the results of which have just been published in Science magazine, invite further research.    Now that we are aware of how it works,  says Zink,  we are keen to continue.  Several research projects to take place in South America and Asia are currently at the planning stage.

C. diff exists in the environment as a dormant spore. To colonize the gut, C. diff. spores need to germinate and become growing bacteria that produce toxins and damage the large intestine. Researchers know that the use of certain antibiotics lead to a higher risk of C. diff infections, particularly among hospital patients. Casey Theriot, an assistant professor of infectious disease at NC State, wanted to know exactly how C. diff spores were interacting with the microbiota, or natural bacterial environment, within the gut.  We know that within a healthy gut environment, the growth of C. diff is inhibited,  Theriot says.  But we wanted to learn more about the mechanisms behind that inhibitory effect.  Bile acids are made from cholesterol and aid in the digestion and absorption of fats. They also control lipoprotein, glucose, drug and energy metabolism. Primary bile acids are made in the liver and travel through the intestinal tract. In the large intestine, bacteria convert these to secondary bile acids, of which Theriot found many have an inhibitory effect on C. diff growth. Theriot started the project while a research investigator at the University of Michigan with infectious diseases physician Vincent Young and undergraduate researcher Alison Bowman. The researchers looked at the intestinal contents of mice before and after treatment with many different antibiotics. They identified 26 different primary and secondary bile acids and defined the concentrations of those acids before and after treatment. Then they added C. diff spores to the contents in order to find out how the bacterium may germinate and grow in an actual gut environment. Interestingly, they found that the primary bile acids in the small intestine allowed spores to germinate, or begin to grow, regardless of the antibiotic treatment. But when the spores reached the large intestine, where normal gut bacteria generate secondary bile acids, the researchers found that those secondary bile acids stopped the C. diff from growing. When those bacteria   and the secondary bile acids   were not present following antibiotic treatment, the C. diff was able to quickly grow.  These findings are a first step in understanding how the gut microbiota regulates bile acids throughout the intestine,  says Theriot.  Hopefully they will aid the development of future therapies for C. difficile infection and other metabolically relevant disorders such as obesity and diabetes. ","Published: January 8, 2016"

The new cells produced insulin in response to changes in glucose levels, and, when transplanted into mice, the cells protected the animals from developing diabetes in a mouse model of the disease. The new study also presents significant advancements in cellular reprogramming technology, which will allow scientists to efficiently scale up pancreatic cell production and manufacture trillions of the target cells in a step-wise, controlled manner. This accomplishment opens the door for disease modeling and drug screening and brings personalized cell therapy a step closer for patients with diabetes.  Our results demonstrate for the first time that human adult skin cells can be used to efficiently and rapidly generate functional pancreatic cells that behave similar to human beta cells,  says Matthias Hebrok, PhD, director of the Diabetes Center at UCSF and a co-senior author on the study.  This finding opens up the opportunity for the analysis of patient-specific pancreatic beta cell properties and the optimization of cell therapy approaches.  In the study, the scientists first used pharmaceutical and genetic molecules to reprogram skin cells into endoderm progenitor cells early developmental cells that have already been designated to mature into one of a number of different types of organs. With this method, the cells don t have to be taken all the way back to a pluripotent stem cell state, meaning the scientists can turn them into pancreatic cells faster. The researchers have used a similar procedure previously to create heart, brain, and liver cells. After another four molecules were added, the endoderm cells divided rapidly, allowing more than a trillion-fold expansion. Critically, the cells did not display any evidence of tumor formation, and they maintained their identity as early organ-specific cells. The scientists then progressed these endoderm cells two more steps, first into pancreatic precursor cells, and then into fully-functional pancreatic beta cells. Most importantly, these cells protected mice from developing diabetes in a model of disease, having the critical ability to produce insulin in response to changes in glucose levels.  This study represents the first successful creation of human insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells using a direct cellular reprogramming method,  says first author Saiyong Zhu, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease.  The final step was the most unique and the most difficult as molecules had not previously been identified that could take reprogrammed cells the final step to functional pancreatic cells in a dish.

UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers have built on the discovery of Dicer s role in fixing DNA damage to uncover a new potential strategy to kill rapidly dividing, cancerous cells in the brain. In the journal Cell Reports, researchers report that when they removed Dicer from preclinical models of medulloblastoma, a common type of brain cancer in children, they found high levels of DNA damage in the cancer cells, leading to the cells  death. The tumor cells were smaller, and also more sensitive to chemotherapy.  This is the first time that the specific function of Dicer for DNA damage has been looked at in the context of the developing brain or even in brain tumors, despite that the fact that the protein has been extensively studied,  said Mohanish Deshmukh, PhD, a UNC Lineberger member and professor in the UNC School of Medicine Department of Cell Biology and Physiology and also the Neuroscience Center.  We have found that targeting Dicer could be an effective therapy to either prevent cancer development or to actually sensitize tumors to chemotherapy.  Scientists have understood for more than a decade that Dicer plays an important role in the cell for processing microRNAs, which regulate the expression of genes in cells. But Deshmukh said it was in 2012 that scientists discovered a direct role of Dicer in repairing DNA damage. And that function, he said, is of importance for cancer research. That s because rapidly dividing cells -- such as cancer cells -- incur DNA damage as they divide. And chemotherapy and radiation treatments often work by damaging the cells  DNA, leading to cell death. Removing a key enzyme that repairs DNA in cancerous cells could help prevent DNA repair.  We found that cancerous cells upregulate Dicer,  said Vijay Swahari, MBBS, MS, a postdoctoral fellow at the UNC Neuroscience Center and the first author of this study.  We think tumors upregulate Dicer because its function is to repair DNA.  In their study, Deshmukh and his team studied the effect of deleting Dicer in several types of rapidly dividing cells, including of preclinical brain cancer models. They deleted Dicer in the normal, rapidly dividing developing brain cells in the cerebellum of animal models, finding spontaneous DNA damage in the brain cells, leading to severe degeneration of the cerebellum. They also tested whether Dicer had a similar effect on rapidly dividing cells outside of the brain. Upon deleting Dicer from embryonic stem cells, the authors found a similar effect. To test whether they could exploit the role of Dicer to kill cancerous cells, Swahari and his collaborators also deleted Dicer in medulloblastoma models, and found that these cells also had high DNA damage levels and degeneration. The tumor load was lower, and the cells were more sensitive to chemotherapy.  We found that when you delete Dicer, these tumors are more sensitive to DNA damage,  Swahari said.  We also took the next step by injecting chemotherapy into models where Dicer was deleted, finding that not only are the tumors smaller, but the tumors are also more sensitive to chemotherapy.  Based on their findings, the researchers believe that Dicer could be investigated as a potential drug target for medulloblastoma and other types of brain cancer.  We are excited about these results because of the implication that Dicer inhibitors could be developed as a potential therapy for treating rapidly-dividing tumors like medulloblastoma,  Deshmukh said.","Published: January 8, 2016"

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/organonachip-204510,Organ on a Chip In a step toward personalized drug testing  researchers coax human stem cells to form complex tissues  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A new technique for programming human stem cells to produce different types of tissue on demand may ultimately allow personalized organs to be grown for transplant patients. The technique, which also has near-term implications for growing organ-like tissues on a chip, was developed by researchers at MIT. Growing organs on demand, using stem cells derived from patients themselves, could eliminate the lengthy wait that people in need of a transplant are often forced to endure before one becomes available. It could also reduce the risk of a patient s immune system rejecting the transplant, since the tissue would be grown from the patient s own cells, according to Ron Weiss, professor of biological engineering at MIT, who led the research.  Imagine that there is a patient with liver complications,  Weiss says.  We could take skin cells from that person and then [convert] them into stem cells, and then genetically program them to make the liver tissue, and transplant that into the patient.  A rudimentary organ The researchers developed the new technique while investigating whether they could use stem cells to produce pancreatic beta cells for treating patients with diabetes. In order to do this, the researchers needed to devise a means to convert stem cells into pancreatic beta cells on demand. As a first step in this process, they took human induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells   stem cells generated from adult fibroblast, or skin cells   and converted them into  endoderm,  one of the three primary cell types in a developing organism. Endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm make up the three so-called germ layers that contribute to nearly all of the different cell types in the body.  They are the first real step of [cell] differentiation,  Weiss says. The researchers developed a method to use a type of small molecule called dox to induce the IPS cells to express a protein known as GATA6. This protein can convert IPS cells into endoderm. Rather than immediately attempting to convert these endoderm cells into pancreatic cells though, the paper s lead author, Patrick Guye, a former postdoc in Weiss  lab and currently laboratory head with Sanofi-Aventis in Frankfurt, Germany, then decided to allow the cells to continue growing, to monitor their progress. After two weeks, the researchers found that the endoderm, and some mesoderm also present in the cell culture, had matured further, to form a liver  bud,  or small, rudimentary liver.  We observed the development of many cells types found in the fetal liver, including the development of blood vessel-like networks, various mesenchymal precursors, and the formation of early red and white blood cells within our liver-like tissue,  Guye says.  This is especially exciting, as the process looks very similar if not identical to what is happening in the early liver bud in vivo, that is, in our own development.  What s more, the researchers discovered that only those IPS cells that had been exposed to more of the genetic programming, and had therefore gone on to produce more GATA6, became liver tissue. Alongside these were IPS cells that did not make much GATA6, which went on to form ectoderm instead, and then further matured to become early telencephalon, or forebrain. By controlling how much GATA6 the cells expressed, the researchers were able to determine how much liver bud and how much forebrain tissue was generated, Weiss says. This suggests that the technique could be used to produce not just individual tissue types, but different combinations of tissue, he says.  The fact that we are able to produce endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm gives us great hope that we can take each of these germ layers and hopefully grow any kind of tissue we want,  he says. Liver-on-a-chip While it is likely to be some time before the technique can be used to generate transplant organs, it could be used almost immediately to grow different human tissue on which to test new drugs, Weiss says. Using human stem cell-derived organ tissue to test new treatments could be far more reliable than testing on animals, since different species may react differently to a drug, he says. The technique could also allow clinicians to carry out patient-specific drug testing.  If you are not sure whether you will have complications from taking a particular drug, then before you take it you could try it out on your own liver-on-a-chip,  Weiss says. Similarly, the organ-on-a-chip could be used to monitor the interaction between different drugs that people may be taking.  As people age, some are taking 10, 15, or 20 drugs together, and it s impossible for the pharmaceutical companies to test all of these combinations for every individual. But we would be able to test that out,  he says.  That is something that can be done now.  In addition to these therapeutic applications, the technique could allow researchers to gain a better understanding of the development of different types of tissue, such as the liver and neurons. The paper reveals some intrinsic mechanisms underlying the interactions of stem cells during liver development, and provides a useful model that sheds light on the complex process of embryogenesis, says Bing Song, a professor of tissue engineering at Cardiff University in the UK, who was not involved in the research. ""In my field, which is combining genetically modified stem cells and physical stimulation (electrical and magnetic) to cure spinal cord injuries and degenerative disease, the paper has given me some very useful ideas,"" he says. The researchers now hope to investigate whether they can use the technique to grow other organs on demand, such as a pancreas.","Published: January 8, 2016"

One way to reduce the amount released into the environment is by treating wastewater using powdered activated carbon. In the lab, researchers at EPFL have further improved this approach using a super-finely ground variant of the powder, which accelerated micropollutant removal rates by a factor 5 or more. Their study, which could potentially have future applications in Swiss wastewater treatment plants, was published  last month. Swiss authorities have responded to increased micropollutant concentrations in Swiss lakes and rivers by calling for 100 wastewater treatment plants to be upgraded for enhanced micropollutant removal. Ozone treatment, which chemically transforms the micropollutants, is one approach that has proven to be effective. But when the wastewater contains certain chemicals, such as bromides, new toxic compounds can be generated. Treatment using powdered activated carbon avoids this problem, but is more expensive and requires more energy. In the lab, environmental chemists working with Tamar Kohn have now shown that using super-finely ground powdered activated carbon has the potential to bring down the cost of micropollutant removal. All ten representative micropollutants it was tested on were removed more efficiently, in some cases up to 65 times as fast. Achieving the removal target, which Swiss authorities have set at 80%, would therefore require both less time and less carbon.  As the next step, we will have to test the approach in a pilot study to be sure that it is workable in a full-scale wastewater treatment plant,  says Florence Bonvin, the lead author of the study.","Published: January 8, 2016"

Dr. MacIntosh, from the Department of Process Engineering and Applied Science, has been answering media calls from around the world after helping test a long-lost bottle of Alexander Keith s beer discovered at the bottom of Halifax s Northwest Arm this fall. The unopened bottle dates back to the 1800s.  It was far more attention than I expected  says Dr. MacIntosh.  For some reason this is a story that has really taken off. We ve been in contact with Canadian Press, this morning we chatted with Global News on their breakfast show and [the Discovery Channel TV show] Daily Planet will be airing their segment [in an upcoming episode].  The Daily Planet visit, which happened while the tests were taking place, was particularly exciting for Dr. MacIntosh, as he grew up watching the show when it used to be called Discovery CA.  It was quite a pleasure to move from them inspiring me as a kid to working with them now.  Lost and found Amateur scuba diver John Crouse found the bottle in late November last year, near the Northwest Arm s Dingle, buried in the mud under several meters of water. The bottle s markings suggest it dates sometime between 1872 and 1890, with ink preserved on the cork indicating it as a product of  A. Keith s Brewers.  The discovery was covered in local news outlets, which is where Dr. MacIntosh heard about it.  I thought to myself that it would be a fun opportunity to test that,  he recalls. Another person who noticed the news coverage was Christopher Reynolds of Halifax s Stillwell Beer Bar. He approached Crouse and, together, decided to get the bottle s contents tested.  They contacted Propeller [Brewery],  says Dr. MacIntosh,  and their QA manager Jessica Forbes is a former student of ours: she went through our Food Science program, and she completed research in the brewing field under Dr. Alex Spears. So she was familiar with the lab and what we are capable of doing so she pointed Chris in our direction.  Brew possibilities A professor of chemical engineering and food science, Dr. MacIntosh says the two fields are very closely related.  I specifically study fermentation which takes many forms,  he explains.  [There s] pharmaceutical fermentation, when you are trying to create an antibiotic. We do bio algae fermentation to try to make biofuels and, of course, production of food products such as beers, ciders and eventually spirits.  Dr. MacIntosh says the department does  a lot of work with the local brewing market to try and advance their technology  and that their connections to the Canadian Institute of Fermentation Technology (CIFT) help make that happen. Dr. MacIntosh teaches a class called Advanced Brewing Science, which is mostly taken as an elective for Chemical Engineering students. It s a class that s well-aligned with the rising popularity of craft brewing.  The students coming into that course are now more educated than they have been previously about the many different styles, the many different techniques that are used in brewing and that has helped to offer a much more involved course,  says Dr. MacIntosh.  It s really a fun course to teach.  Many of the students are able to take what they ve learned into careers in brewing. Dr. MacIntosh says he knows of students working at Olands, Propeller, a brewery in England and one student at a brewing research station in the United States.  It s quite exciting to maintain connections with students who proceed into this field and see how it s being done elsewhere in the world. One of our professors, Alex Spears, is on leave from Dalhousie but he s now acting as the chair of the Institute of Brewing and Distilling in Scotland. So we re really able to collaborate with people all around the world.  Testing the treasure Dr. MacIntosh is looking forward to the science that will come from testing the contents of the discovered bottle.  All of the chemicals that make up the beer, whether it s skunky or buttery, all of those have a peculiar chemical that contributes to that flavor. We can identify those, quantify those and it will give us some clues about the raw materials that were used in the production of that beer. They are set up to do that in Scotland with Dr. Spears, so we ve taken a sample that we ll be sending to him that s leaving tomorrow [Friday] and between our two analyses we ll be able to paint a complete picture of that beer which we plan to publish.  Which begs the question: did Dr. MacIntosh get the chance to taste the 130-year-old brew?  At the end [of the testing] we had a couple of millilitres left that couldn t go back into the bottle. It tasted terrible. Beer does not age like wine. Don t go drinking random bottles you find in the harbour. ","Published: January 8, 2016"

It only takes a single fly to alight on your picnic lunch to make you uneasy about what germs may have landed with it. But what harm can come from a fly landing on your food? Should you throw it away? There are hundreds of different fly species in Australia. This diverse group of insects ranges from mosquitoes and biting midges to bush flies and blowflies. They play an important role in the environment by assisting decomposition, pollinating plants and providing food for insectivorous predators. They can help solve crimes and treat infected wounds. Many of these flies pose a health risk but none hang about our homes more than the house fly. It s a ubiquitous presence during the warmer months, can be a substantial annoyance and may also be a potential health risk. Musca domestica, commonly known as the house fly, is one of the most widespread nuisance insects in the world. It has found a place in and around our homes. It is closely associated with rotting organic waste, including dead animals and faeces. It s no surprise they re commonly known as  filth flies . After laying eggs, maggots will hatch out and eat their way through the decaying organic material before pupating and then emerging as an adult fly a few days later. The adult flies can live up to a month and may lay hundreds of eggs over that time. From poop to plate When it comes to passing on pathogens, it s not necessarily the fly itself but where it s come from that matters. Flies don t just visit freshly made sandwiches. They spend far more of their time in rotting animal and plant waste. Among this waste can be a range of pathogens and parasites. House flies don t bite. Unlike mosquitoes that transmit pathogens of human health importance in their saliva, house flies transmit pathogens on their feet and body. As well as leaving behind pathogen-filled footprints, the flies leave their poop on our food. They vomit too. Flies don t have teeth. They can t take a bite out of our food, so they have to spit out some enzyme-rich saliva that dissolves the food, allowing them to suck up the resulting soup of regurgitated digestive fluids and partially dissolved food. If a fly has plenty of time to walk around on our food vomiting up, sucking in and defecating out, the chances of leaving behind a healthy population of pathogens are high. Brush off or toss out? In most instances, spotting a fly on your food doesn t mean you need to throw it out. While there is little doubt that flies can carry bacteria, viruses and parasites from waste to our food, a single touchdown is unlikely to trigger a chain reaction leading to illness for the average healthy person. Flies that land out of sight and wander about for a few minutes vomiting and pooping on your food or food preparation area are more of a concern. The more time passes, the greater the chance of pathogens left behind by the flies growing and multiplying on our food. That s when health risks increase. Having plenty of flies about can be a concern but risk is generally higher in regions away from the city. There are not only likely to be higher numbers of flies but a greater chance they ll be in contact with dead animals and animal waste. There is no shortage of opportunities for flies in the city either but, for the most part, insecticides and improved hygiene standards assist in fly control and minimising the risk of contact with contaminated substances. Ensure your food is covered while preparing, cooking and serving outdoors and don t leave  leftovers  sitting about outside for the flies. There are plenty of other reasons food safety is important over the summer, not just to stop flies touching down. Screening windows and doors will help block flies from coming inside, but also minimising garbage around the house is critical. Ensure bins are cleaned regularly, household garbage is covered and animal waste is routinely cleaned up. The addition of insecticidal surface sprays around bin areas will help and, inside the home, a range of knockdown sprays will keep the numbers of flies down. An old-school fly swat works a treat too.","Published: January 8, 2016"

Study results showed that the use of the LiMAx test led to reductions in post-operative liver failure and to a decrease of liver failure related mortality. Post-operative liver failure is a severe complication after partial liver resections. Pre-existing hepatic dysfunction therefore remains a major concern when considering patients for liver resection. We need selection criteria that accurately identify patients in whom a surgical intervention can be safely performed. Humedics  LiMAx test has been demonstrated to accurately and reliably assess liver function in both healthy subjects and patients with cirrhosis. It furthermore has been shown to be unaffected by age, gender or obesity. In a retrospective study at the Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, Charit   Universit tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow Hospital, 1170 patients undergoing elective hepatectomy between January 2006 and December 2011 were analyzed. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the LiMAx test on patient selection and outcome. Propensity score matching was used to compare the effects on morbidity and mortality of the integration of the LiMAx algorithm into clinical practice. Study results showed that even with more cirrhotic patients were selected to undergo liver surgery (6.9% in 2006 to 11.3% in 2011), the post-operative liver failure rate were dramatically decreased by 54.4% after the full implementation of LiMAx algorithm. Besides, the liver failure-related mortality dropped from 4% to 0.9% regardless of the increase in complex hepatectomy cases (including extended right hepatectomies and resections with concomitant biliary and/or vascular reconstruction). The analysis of data for the propensity score-matched cohort suggests that the integration of the LiMAx algorithm was a major factor contributing to the improved outcomes. In conclusion, the integration of the LiMAx algorithm seems to have played an important role in optimizing risk assessment prior to hepatic surgery. Investigator PD Dr. Martin Stockmann said:  We saw an increasing number of complex hepatectomies over the study period and at the same time a decline in postoperative liver failure and in particular a reduction in the number of postoperative liver failure related deaths. In my opinion the improved outcomes are associated with the integration of the LiMAx test in our routine work-up.  A major strength of this study is that the analysis is based on all consecutive and unselected patients over 6 years that received partial hepatic resection of one or more segments in an attempt to overcome a potential selection bias. Erwin de Buijzer, CEO of Humedics GmbH, stated:  We are very pleased that this retrospective study demonstrates once more the usefulness of our LiMAx test and its benefits for patients considered for liver surgery. For us, this study is especially interesting because the long study period covers the time of the introduction of the LiMAx test into the work routine at the Charit  and clearly demonstrates the improvements in clinical outcomes over six years.  The LiMAx test, together with the corresponding FLIP device and the diagnostic drug offers a clinically proven significant added value for patients with liver diseases and liver surgery.","Published: January 8, 2016"

The new handheld test will be based on Philips  Minicare I-20 system. The financial details of the agreement were not disclosed. The collaboration unites Philips  strength in patient monitoring and handheld diagnostics technologies, as well as, clinical decision support applications for use in acute care settings, and Banyan Biomarkers  knowledge of biomolecules that are indicative of neurological injuries.  Point-of-care diagnostics for acute care settings, such as handheld blood tests for Emergency Departments, will play a critical role in improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs,  said Marcel van Kasteel, CEO of Handheld Diagnostics at Philips.  The joint development agreement with Banyan Biomarkers is another great example of our expansion into this fast growing market. Our innovative Minicare technology platform and partnerships are a firm foundation for our ambition to become a leader in this new growth market for Philips.  ""A rapid and objective point-of-care test to evaluate traumatic brain injury will help millions of patients throughout the world,"" said Jackson Streeter MD, CEO, Banyan Biomarkers. ""This partnership with Philips to develop and commercialize a TBI blood test on the Minicare system is an important step forward in providing physicians and other healthcare providers information to evaluate patients who have suffered a concussion."" Diagnosing concussions is often difficult because the brain injury may not be obvious without a reliable and objective test. Often a CT scan of the patient s brain is found to be normal despite the patient having significant head injury and symptoms. Failure to make a correct diagnosis and timely selection of the appropriate treatment can have serious implications for the patient. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control, there were approximately 2.5 million Emergency Department visits, hospitalizations, or deaths associated with TBI in the US in 2010. As a result, direct and indirect costs of TBI in the US were approximately USD 76.5 billion. Currently, there is no blood test for use by physicians in the hospital to detect the presence and severity of brain trauma, such as concussion. Following a brain injury, a destructive cascade of biological events continue over hours and days that may worsen the patient s condition. Banyan Biomarkers has identified two proteins that rapidly appear in the blood of patients soon after injury. The new blood test to detect the proteins will be based on Philips  Minicare I-20 system. The system consists of a handheld analyzer, dedicated software and a single use, disposable cartridge containing the application specific test. Based on Philips  proprietary Magnotech biosensor technology, the Minicare I-20 system is being developed to detect multiple target molecules at low concentrations with a blood sample and to show the results on the analyzer display within minutes. Mr. van Kasteel added:  This partnership will broaden the menu offering on our Minicare I-20 system and will strengthen our competitive position in point-of-care diagnostics for the Emergency Department.  The Minicare activities are part of Philips  Handheld Diagnostics business, which has its headquarters and manufacturing lines at the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.","Published: January 8, 2016"

Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute and the Department of Neuroscience at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) have identified a cellular circuit that helps the mouse brain to remember which environments are safe, and which are harmful. Their study also reveals what can happen when that circuitry is disrupted and may offer new insight into the treatment of conditions such as posttraumatic stress, panic and anxiety disorders. The researchers have published their findings in the journal Science. Learning and memory are among the brain's most fundamental tools for survival. Accurate encoding of 'contextual' memories those associated with particular experiences enables us to exhibit the appropriate fear responses and, importantly, avoid dangerous situations. Of equal importance is the brain's ability to discriminate between an environment that it has previously learned to be dangerous and one that is safe. Earlier research demonstrated that contextual memories are formed and stored in two interconnected brain regions: the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, which are involved in memory and navigation. These two regions are linked via a complex network of neurons. Although scientists have been able to determine how most of this network operates, one connection has remained puzzling. ""Neurons in the entorhinal cortex wind their way into the hippocampus via two distinct routes, or pathways,"" explained Jayeeta Basu, PhD, an assistant professor in neuroscience and physiology at the NYU Neuroscience Institute. Dr. Basu was this study's first author and is a former postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Steven Siegelbaum, PhD, at CUMC. ""It is thought that contextual memories are formed when these two pathways became activated as part of a carefully timed sequence. But a few years ago, scientists discovered a third pathway that linked the two regions whose purpose was unknown."" About 80% of neurons in the brain are excitatory meaning that they carry communications long distances across brain regions, while the other 20% are inhibitory. These inhibitory neurons act locally to slow or halt the excitatory activity--much like tapping the brake pedal after a period of acceleration. What was so unusual about the neurons in this recently discovered third pathway was that they acted across a relatively long distance, but were also inhibitory. So scientists called them long-range inhibitory projections, or LRIPs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role these LRIPs may play in learning and memory. First, the researchers temporarily silenced them in the mouse brains. Then, the mice were placed in a room where they were given a brief but aversive footshock. When returned to the same room 24 hours later, the mice remembered the shock and exhibited a fear response, indicating that LRIPs were not required for the formation of fearful memories. But when placed in a completely different room, these mice again exhibited fear, suggesting they were generalizing their initial fear in a different context. This is in stark contrast to what was observed in normal, healthy mice, which only exhibited a fear response in the room where they had been shocked and thus revealing their ability to distinguish between dangerous and neutral environments. Additional imaging experiments and electrical recordings from normal, healthy mouse brains revealed the precise role of LRIPs in astounding detail. Normally a stimulus such as a sound, light or small footshock activates the LRIPs, which send an inhibitory signal from the entorhinal cortex into the hippocampus. Upon arrival, the LRIP signal actually inhibits another set of inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus. This then frees up neurons in the hippocampus to switch on and, ultimately, generate a memory. This seemingly confusing series of signal relays is actually part of a sophisticated gating mechanism, as evidenced by a short, 20-millisecond delay between when the LRIPs are initially activated, and when their inhibitory signals arrive in the hippocampus. ""This brief delay enables the electrical signals to flow into the hippocampus in an elegant, precisely timed sequence, which is ultimately what allows the memory to form and be stored with the appropriate specificity so that it can be recalled accurately,"" said Dr. Siegelbaum, who is a principal investigator at the Zuckerman Institute, chair of the Department of Neuroscience at CUMC and senior author of the paper. ""Without this delay, fearful memories lack specificity and accuracy, preventing the brain from appropriately distinguishing danger from safety."" ""The implications of these findings for the human brain, while preliminary, are intriguing,"" said Attila Losonczy, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of neuroscience at CUMC, a principal investigator at the Zuckerman Institute, and a co-author of this study. ""The study suggests that any alterations in these pathways activity particularly a disruption of the timed delay--may contribute to pathological forms of fear response, such as posttraumatic stress, anxiety, or panic disorders.""

These are the things that, no matter what the circumstance, you'd never compromise for any reason such as ""I'd never hurt a child,"" or ""I'm against the death penalty."" Real-time brain scans show that when people read stories that deal with these core, protected values, the ""default mode network"" in their brains activates. This network was once thought of as just the brain's autopilot, since it has been shown to be active when you're not engaged by anything in the outside world but studies like this one suggest that it's actually working to find meaning in the narratives. ""The brain is devoting a huge amount of energy to whatever that network is doing. We need to understand why,"" said Jonas Kaplan of the University of Southern California (USC) Dornsife Brain and Creativity Institute. Kaplan was the lead author of the study, published this month in the journal Cerebral Cortex. Kaplan thinks that it's not just that the brain is presented with a moral quandary, but rather that the quandary is presented in a narrative format. ""Stories help us to organize information in a unique way,"" he said. To find relevant stories, the researchers sorted through 20 million blog posts using software developed at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies. ""We wanted to know how people tell stories in their daily lives. It was kind of like finding stories in their natural habitat,"" said Kaplan, assistant research professor of psychology at the Brain and Creativity Institute at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. That 20 million was pared down to 40 stories that each contained an example of a crisis involving a potentially protected value: cheating on a spouse, having an abortion, crossing a picket line, or getting in a fight. Those stories were translated into Mandarin Chinese and Farsi, and then read by American, Chinese and Iranian participants in their native language while their brains were scanned by fMRI. They also answered general questions about the stories while being scanned. Stories that participants said involved values that were protected to them activated the default mode network in their brain to a greater degree. In addition, the level of activation varied from culture to culture. On average, Iranians showed the greatest level of activation in the study, while the Chinese participants showed the least. ""Stories appear to be a fundamental way in which the brain organizes information in a practical and memorable manner. It is important to understand the neural mechanisms required to do this, and this study is a step in that direction,"" said Antonio Damasio, senior author of the study. Damasio is co-director of the Brain and Creativity Institute, holder of the David Dornsife Chair in Neuroscience and a professor of psychology and neurology. It's not yet clear whether a value either is or is not protected, or whether the sacredness of a value is on a sliding scale. But in a nation where political beliefs are growing more polarized and entrenched, it's important to understand what biological processes lie at the root of these values, Kaplan said. ""People will often hold political values as protected values and protected values are at the root of many political conflicts around the world, which is why they're interesting to us,"" he said.

Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC), and the Universit  Paris Descartes have found that deficits in social memory a crucial yet poorly understood feature of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia may be due to a decrease in the number of a particular class of brain cells, called inhibitory neurons, in a little-explored region within the brain's memory center. The findings, which are reported in the journal Neuron, explain some of the underlying mechanisms that lead to the more difficult-to-treat symptoms of schizophrenia, including social withdrawal, reduced motivation and decreased emotional capacity. See Also: Retinal changes may serve as measures of brain pathology in schizophrenia Scientists have long speculated that schizophrenia, which affects about 1 in every 100 adults worldwide, originates in part in the hippocampus the brain's headquarters for memory and spatial navigation. As a result, nearly every region of the hippocampus has been studied extensively in the hopes of gaining insight into the disorder. One notable exception is a tiny region of the hippocampus known as CA2. ""Smaller and less well-defined than other parts of the hippocampus, CA2 was like a small island that was depicted on old maps but remained unexplored,"" explained Vivien Chevaleyre, PhD, group leader in neuroscience at the Universit  Paris Descartes and a lead author of the paper. Several discoveries have focused attention on a possible association between CA2 and schizophrenia. This region of the hippocampus is associated with vasopressin, a hormone that plays a role in sexual bonding, motivation and other intensely social behaviors, which become impaired in people with the disorder. In addition, postmortem examinations of people with schizophrenia have revealed a marked decrease in the number of CA2 inhibitory neurons, while the rest of the hippocampus remained largely unaffected. However, the significance of this loss had remained unclear. In this study, the researchers performed a series of electrophysiological and behavioral experiments on a mouse model of schizophrenia developed at CUMC. By examining the brains of these mice, the researchers observed a substantial decrease in inhibitory CA2 neurons, as compared to a control group of normal, healthy mice a change remarkably similar to that previously observed in postmortem examinations of people with schizophrenia. Moreover, the team discovered that the modified mice had a significantly reduced capacity for social memory compared with the controls. This raises the hypothesis that changes to CA2 may account for some of the social behavioral changes that occur in individuals with the disorder. ""Even the timing of the emergence of symptoms in the mice during young adulthood parallels the onset of schizophrenia in humans,"" said Joseph Gogos, PhD, a professor of physiology and neuroscience at CUMC, a principal investigator at the Zuckerman Institute and a lead author of the paper. ""We can now examine the effects of schizophrenia at the cellular level and at the behavioral level,"" said Steven Siegelbaum, PhD, chair of the Department of Neuroscience at CUMC, a principal investigator at the Zuckerman Institute and a co-author of the paper.

A team of researchers under the leadership of the University of Bonn has now developed a method for guiding replacement cells to diseased vascular segments using nanoparticles. The scientists demonstrated in mice that the fresh cells actually exert their curative effect in these segments. However, much research remains to be done prior to use in humans.  In arterial calcification (arteriosclerosis), pathological deposits form in the arteries and this leads to vascular stenosis. Strokes and heart attacks are a frequent outcome due to the resultant insufficient blood flow. Endothelial cells which line the blood vessels play an important role here. ""They produce nitric oxide and also regulate the expansion of the vessels and the blood pressure,"" explains junior professor Dr. med. Daniela Wenzel from the Institute of Physiology I of the University of Bonn. Damage to the endothelial cells is generally the insidious onset of arteriosclerosis.A team of researchers working with Jun.-Prof. Wenzel, together with the Technische Universit t M nchen, the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Bonn Hospital and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt Berlin, developed a method with which damaged endothelial cells can regenerate and which they successfully tested in mice. The scientists transferred the gene for the enzyme eNOS into cultured cells with the aid of viruses. This enzyme stimulates nitic oxide production in the endothelium like a turboloader. ""The enzyme is an essential precondition for the full restoration of the original function of the endothelial cells,"" reports Dr. Sarah Vosen from Jun.-Prof. Wenzel's team. A magnet delivers the nanoparticles to the desired site Together with the gene, the scientists also introduced tiny nanoparticles, measuring a few hundred nanometers (one-millionth of a millimeter), with an iron core. ""The iron changes the properties of the endothelial cells: They become magnetic,"" explains Dr. Sarah Rieck from the Institute of Physiology I of the University of Bonn. The nanoparticles ensure that the endothelial cells equipped with the 'turbo' gene can be delivered to the desired site in the blood vessel using a magnet where they exert their curative effect. Researchers at the Technische Universit t M nchen have developed a special ring-shaped magnet configuration for this which ensures that the replacement cells equipped with nanoparticles line the blood vessel evenly. The researchers tested this combination method in mice whose carotid artery endothelial cells were injured. They injected the replacement cells into the artery and were able to position them at the correct site using the magnet. ""After half an hour, the endothelial cells adhered so securely to the vascular wall that they could no longer be flushed away by the bloodstream,"" says Jun.-Prof. Wenzel. The scientists then removed the magnets and tested whether the fresh cells had fully regained their function. As desired, the new endothelial cells produced nitric oxide and thus expanded the vessel, as is usual in the case of healthy arteries. ""The mouse woke up from the anesthesia and ate and drank normally,"" reported the physiologist. Transfer to humans requires additional research Normally, doctors surgically remove vascular deposits from the carotid artery and in some cases place a vascular support (stent) to correct the bottleneck in the crucial blood supply. ""However, these areas frequently become blocked with deposits once again,"" reports Jun.-Prof. Wenzel. ""In contrast, we are getting to the root of the problem and are restoring the original condition of healthy endothelial cells."" The researchers hope that what works in mice is also possible in humans, in principle. However, there are still many challenges to overcome.

In the research, the team used hamster-chicken hybrid cells to discover why avian influenza virus (bird flu) cannot usually infect mammal cells.  They found that a particular host protein - called ANP32A - which is also found in human cells, acts as an 'insider' and helps the virus replicate once the virus has gained entry into the cell.  Bird flu viruses can't use the mammalian ANP32A unless they carry a particular mutation. As well as understanding how bird flu viruses can make the jump from birds to humans, scientists can now also explore whether it is possible to develop drugs that target this human protein, to prevent the flu virus replicating. Professor Wendy Barclay, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial and senior author of the study, explains: ""All human flu viruses in the world originally came from birds. However, luckily for us, viruses don't often jump from birds to people because the virus can't replicate in our cells. When they do transfer to humans, it's because the virus mutates in a number of ways. This enables it to gain a foothold inside the cell, and hijack the cell machinery to replicate. ""Up until now, we haven't understood why the bird flu virus has to change in order to hijack the human cell machinery. Our research showed this is all due to a cell protein called ANP32A.""  To find this essential host factor, the Imperial team used hamster cells carrying fragments of chicken DNA and tested whether the virus was able to replicate inside them. As this virus cannot normally infect mammalian cells, the team deduced that any hamster cell in which the virus replicated, must contain the avian protein the virus requires. After observing which cells the virus replicated in, the researchers then analysed which chicken genes were present to identify the protein. They then realised the same protein existed in humans, but that the mammalian versions were all shorter than the equivalent bird proteins.  Bird flu viruses can't use the mammalian protein unless they have a mutation that adapts them for the shorter version, which is why most bird viruses cannot infect humans.

Jason Long, lead author of the study also from the Department of Medicine, added: ""Our experiments also showed that removing this host protein from cells stopped virus infection, suggesting it is very important for the virus.

In the past decade, billions of dollars have been spent on technology that can quickly and inexpensively read and write DNA to synthesize and manipulate polypeptides and proteins. That technology, however, stumbles when it encounters a repetitive genetic recipe. This includes many natural and synthetic materials used for a range of applications from biological adhesives to synthetic silk. Like someone struggling with an  impossible  jigsaw puzzle, synthesizers have trouble determining which genetic piece goes where when many of the building blocks look the same. Scientists from Duke University have removed this hurdle by developing a freely available computer program based on the  traveling salesman  mathematics problem. Synthetic biologists can now find the least-repetitive genetic code to build the molecule they want to study. The researchers say their program will allow those with limited resources or expertise to easily explore synthetic biomaterials that were once available to only a small fraction of the field.  Synthesizing and working with highly repetitive polypeptides is a very challenging and tedious process, which has long been a barrier to entering the field,  said Ashutosh Chilkoti, the Theo Pilkington Professor of Biomedical Engineering and chair of the biomedical engineering department at Duke.  But with the help of our new tool, what used to take researchers months of work can now be ordered online by anyone for about $100 and the genes received in a few weeks, making repetitive polypeptides much easier to study.  Every protein and polypeptide is based on the sequencing of two or more amino acids. The genetic recipe for an individual amino acid called a codon is three letters of DNA long. But nature has 61 codons that produce 20 amino acids, meaning there are multiple codons that yield a given amino acid. Because synthetic biologists can get the same amino acid from multiple codons, they can avoid troublesome DNA repeats by swapping in different codons that achieve the same effect.  The challenge is finding the least repetitive genetic code that still makes the desired polypeptide or protein.  I always thought there was a potential solution, that there must be a way of mathematically figuring it out,  said Chilkoti.  I had offered this problem to graduate students before, but nobody wanted to tackle it because it requires a particular combination of high-level math, computer science and molecular biology. But Nicholas Tang was the right guy.  After studying the problem in detail, Nicholas Tang, a doctoral candidate in Chilkoti s laboratory, discovered that the solution is a version of the  traveling salesman  mathematics problem. The classic question is, given a map with a set of cities to visit, what is the shortest route possible that hits every city exactly once before returning to the original city? After writing the algorithm, Tang put it to the test. He created a laundry list of 19 popular repetitive polypeptides that are currently being studied in laboratories around the world. After passing the codes through the program, he sent them for synthesis by commercial biotechnology outfits a task that would be impossible for any one of the original codes. Without the help of commercial technology, researchers spend months building the DNA that cells use to produce the proteins being studied. It s a tedious, repetitive task not the most attractive prospect to a young graduate student. But if the new program worked, the process could be reduced to a few weeks of waiting for machines to deliver the goods instead. When Tang received his DNA, they each were introduced into living cells to produce the desired polypeptide as hoped.  He made 19 different polymers from the field in one shot,  said Chilkoti.  What probably took tens of researchers years to create, he was able to reproduce in a single paper in a matter of weeks.  Chilkoti and Tang are now working to make the new computer program available online for anybody to use through a simple web form, opening a new area of synthetic biology for all to explore.  This advance really democratizes the field of synthetic biology and levels the playing field,  said Tang.  Before, you had to have a lot of expertise and patience to work with repetitive sequences, but now anyone can just order them online. We think this could really break open the bottleneck that has held the field back and hopefully recruit more people into the field. ","Published: January 7, 2016"

HCV-AH is known to be active against a wide range of viruses including West Nile, dengue, measles and HIV. The HCV-AH peptide appears to target an Achilles  heel common to many viruses, most likely a property of the lipid coating or envelope, said study author Atul Parikh, professor of biomedical engineering at UC Davis. That means that it s less likely that viruses can readily evolve to become resistant to the peptide. Parikh, Nam-Joon Cho of Nanyang Technological University and colleagues tested the properties of HCV-AH with simplified model lipid membranes. Essentially, these are tiny  soap bubbles  made up of a layer of lipids, just like living cells and viruses, but without the cellular contents. The HCV-AH peptide had different effects depending on the composition of the membrane. When the membranes were rich in cholesterol, like those of many viruses, the peptide caused the membrane lipids to clump together forming bright spots under the microscope. But cholesterol-free membranes did not show the same effect. Additional experiments showed that the peptide also had different effects depending on the size of the vesicle. There are currently no antiviral drugs that work by destabilizing the virus membrane, Cho said, although some have been proposed. The researchers now plan to move to study the effects of the peptide on more complex membranes and then live human cells and viruses. If the mechanism still seems promising, it could eventually move into preclinical testing.  Understanding how the drug candidate interacts with these biologically important lipids, we reason, should open the door to deciphering the rich and complex biology of these systems and lead to new opportunities for antiviral strategies,  Parikh said.","Published: January 7, 2016"

Quantum dots are being widely investigated due to their unique physical, optical, and electronic properties,  explained Andrew M. Smith, an assistant professor of bioengineering at Illinois.  Their most important feature is bright, stable light emission that can be tuned across a broad range of colors. This has made them useful for diverse applications as imaging agents and molecular probes in cells and tissues and as light-emitting components of LEDs and TVs.   These studies are the first example of flat quantum dots, called nanoplatelets, in biological systems,  said Smith.  We have developed a unique nanoparticle that is flat, like a disc, and encapsulated within a biological particle. These are derived from quantum dots and they similarly emit light, however, they have a slew of interesting optical and structural properties because of their shape. Their light absorbing and light emitting properties are closer those of quantum wells, which are thin-layers used to make lasers. We find that these particles uniquely enter cells very rapidly and we are using them as sensors in living cells. The new colloidal material is a hybrid between an inorganic quantum well and an organic nanodisc composed of phospholipids and lipoproteins,  explained Sung Jun Lim, a postdoctoral fellow in Smith s research group and first author of the paper,  Lipoprotein Nanoplatelets: Brightly Fluorescent, Zwitterionic Probes with Rapid Cellular Entry.   The phospholipids bind to the flat faces on the nanoplatelet and lipoproteins bind to curved edges to homogeneously entrap the particles in biocompatible materials. They have long-term stability in biological buffers and high salt solutions and are highly fluorescent, with brightness comparable to quantum dots when measured in a solution or at the single-molecule level in a microscope.  According to Smith, these particles are especially useful for single-molecule imaging, where quantum dots have made the biggest impact due to their unique combination of high light emission rate and compact size. Quantum dots have recently enabled the discovery of a host of new biological processes related to human health and disease.  We think the new capabilities provided by nanoplatelets are valuable for imaging biological molecules and cells, but it was previously challenging to stabilize these nanocrystals in biological media because their unusual dimensions cause them to stick together, aggregate, and lose fluorescence. This new class of nanoplatelets solves these problems and they are stable under harsh biological conditions because they are encapsulated in lipoproteins.  We expect that this new material composite will reveal, at the single-molecule level, how flat materials interact with biological systems,  Smith added.  The unique finding of rapid cellular entry suggests that these materials may be immediately useful for cellular labeling applications to allow highly multiplexed spectral encoding of cellular identity so that we can track metastatic cancer cells in the body. Unique shapes of nanoparticles also have been found to be more efficient for delivering drugs to tumors compared with standard spherical particles, so we are exploring this as well.","Published: January 7, 2016"

Researchers at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine have announced the first-ever evidence-based description of the neuronal protein clumps thought to be important in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig s disease, a fatal neurodegenerative condition. The study also provides the first definitive evidence that these protein clumps are indeed toxic to the type of neurons that die in patients with ALS. This research development could be a crucial step toward developing drugs to stop the creation of the clumps and stem the progression of the disease. Cures for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases have long eluded researchers, largely because their causes have remained mysterious.  One of the biggest puzzles in health care is how to address neurodegenerative diseases; unlike many cancers and other conditions, we currently have no leverage against these neurodegenerative diseases,  said senior study author Nikolay Dokholyan, PhD, the Michael Hooker Distinguished Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics at UNC.  This study is a big breakthrough because it sheds light on the origin of motor neuron death and could be very important for drug discovery.  Patients with ALS suffer gradual paralysis and early death as a result of the loss of motor neurons, which are crucial to moving, speaking, swallowing, and breathing. The study focuses on a subset of ALS cases   an estimated 1 to 2 percent   that are associated with variations in a protein known as SOD1. However, even in patients without mutations in their SOD1 gene, this protein has been shown to form potentially toxic clumps. The researchers discovered that the protein forms temporary clumps of three, known as a  trimer,  and that these clumps are capable of killing motor neuron-like cells grown in the laboratory.  This is a major step because nobody has known exactly what toxic interactions are behind the death of motor neurons in patients with ALS,  said Elizabeth Proctor, PhD, a graduate student in Dokholyan s laboratory at the time of the study and the paper s first author.  Knowing what these trimers look like, we can try to design drugs that would stop them from forming, or sequester them before they can do damage. We are very excited about the possibilities.  Researchers zeroed in on SOD1 after genetic mutations affecting the protein were linked with ALS in the early 1990s. But the exact form of aggregated protein that is responsible for killing neurons has been hard to identify, and many of the clumps that are thought to be toxic disintegrate almost as soon as they form, making them exceedingly difficult to study.  It is thought that part of what makes them so toxic is their instability,  said Proctor, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at MIT.  Their unstable nature makes them more reactive with parts of the cell that they should not be affecting.  Until now, researchers did not know what these fleeting clumps looked like or how they might affect cells. To crack the mystery, the research team used a combination of computational modeling and experiments in live cells. Proctor spent two years developing a custom algorithm to determine the trimers  structure, an aspect of the study Dokholyan described as  an outstanding tour de force  akin to mapping the structure of a ball of yarn after taking snippets of just its outermost layer and then figuring out how they fit together.  Once the trimers  structure was established, the team spent several more years developing methods to test the trimers  effects on motor neuron-like cells grown in the laboratory. The results were clear: SOD1 proteins that were tightly bound into trimers were lethal to the motor neuron-like cells, while non-clumped SOD1 proteins were not. The team plans to further investigate the  glue  that holds the trimers together in order to find drugs that could break them apart or keep them from forming. In addition, these findings could help shed light on other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s.  There are many similarities among neurodegenerative diseases,  said Dokholyan.  What we have found here seems to corroborate what is known about Alzheimer s already, and if we can figure out more about what is going on here, we could potentially open up a framework to be able to understand the roots of other neurodegenerative diseases.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/highfidelity-crispr-196900,High fidelity CRISPR Improved gene editing tool has no detectable off target mutations   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A new version of the CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease appears to robustly abolish the unwanted, off-target DNA breaks that are a significant current limitation of the gene-editing technology.  Harvard Medical School researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital describe in Nature how engineering the Cas9 enzyme to reduce nonspecific interactions with the target DNA may greatly expand applications of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology.  Our creation of a Cas9 variant that brings off-target effects to levels where we can no longer detect them, even with the most sensitive methods, provides a substantial advance for therapeutic applications in which you want to accurately hit your target without causing damage anywhere else in the genome,  said J. Keith Joung, HMS professor of pathology at Mass General and senior author of the paper.   Its impact will also be incredibly important for research applications because off-target effects can potentially confound the results of any experiment,  Joung added.  As a result, we envision that our high-fidelity variant will supplant the use of standard Cas9 for many research and therapeutic applications.  The limitation Used to create targeted DNA breaks at which genetic changes can be introduced, CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases combine a bacterial DNA-cutting enzyme called Cas9 with a short guide RNA sequence that can bind to the target DNA sequence. While easier to use than previous gene-editing tools, CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases have a well-characterized and significant limitation.  As described in 2013 studies led by Joung and others, CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases can induce off-target DNA breaks at sites that resemble the on-target sequence. Subsequent investigations by Joung s team and others have reduced but never completely and consistently eliminated these off-target effects. Joung and his colleagues hypothesized that reducing interactions between Cas9 and the target DNA might more completely eliminate off-target effects while still retaining the desired on-target interaction. The team focused on the fact that certain portions of the Cas9 enzyme itself can interact with the backbone of the target DNA molecule.  Pursuing an observation originally made by co-lead author Vikram Pattanayak, HMS clinical fellow in pathology at Mass General, the team altered four of these Cas9-mediated contacts by replacing the long amino acid side chains that bind to the DNA backbone with shorter ones unable to make those connections.   Our previous work suggested that Cas9 might bind to its intended target DNA site with more energy than it needs, enabling unwanted cleavage of imperfectly matched off-target sites,  said Pattanayak.  We reasoned that, by making substitutions at these four positions, we could remove some of that energy to eliminate off-target effects while still retaining full on-target activities.  Testing the fix Co-lead author Benjamin Kleinstiver, HMS research fellow in pathology at Mass General, andMichelle Prew, a research technician in Joung s lab, then tested all 15 possible variants in which any combination of one, two, three or four of those amino acid side chains were altered. They found that one three-substitution and one four-substitution variant appeared to show the greatest promise in discriminating against mismatched target sites while retaining full on-target activities in human cells.  The researchers then more fully characterized the four-substitution variant, which they called SpCas9-HF1; Sp for Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, which is the source of this widely used Cas9, and HF for high fidelity. They found that this variant induced on-target effects comparable to those observed with the original unaltered SpCas9 when used with more than 85 percent of 37 different guide RNAs they tested. Using GUIDE-Seq, a highly sensitive system Joung s lab developed in 2014 to detect off-target CRISPR-Cas9 effects across the genome, the team found that, while nucleases combining unaltered SpCas9 with seven different guide RNAs induced as many as 25 off-target mutations, use of SpCas9-HF1 produced no detectable off-target effects with six of those guide RNAs and only one off-target site with the seventh. These results were further confirmed using targeted deep-sequencing experiments. Joung s team also found that SpCas9-HF1 could reduce off-target effects when targeting atypical DNA sites characterized by repeat sequences of one or two nucleotides sites that are typically subject to many off-target mutations. They developed additional derivatives of SpCas9-HF1 called HF2, HF3 and HF4 which could eliminate the few residual off-target effects that persisted with the HF1 variant and a small number of guide RNAs. Engineering new variants  If SpCas9-HF1 using a certain guide RNA still produces a handful of off-target effects that are particularly difficult to eliminate, it may be possible to engineer new variants that get rid of even those effects,  said Joung.  The researchers also showed that SpCas9-HF1, like its naturally occurring counterpart, could be combined with other useful alterations that extend its utility. Previous work from the Joung lab published last summer in Nature showed that introducing a series of amino acid substitutions could expand the targeting range of unaltered SpCas9. In the current study, the authors show that introducing these same alterations into SpCas9-HF1 also extended the targeting range of the high-fidelity variant.  These results show that these variants should be broadly useful to anyone currently using CRISPR-Cas9 technology,  said Kleinstiver.  They can easily be used in place of wild-type SpCas9 and provide a highly effective method for reducing off-target mutations to undetectable levels. ","Published: January 7, 2016"

How this happens remains largely unknown. It has been proposed that alpha-synuclein may behave like a  prion : pathological forms of the protein may be capable of changing the conformation of normal alpha-synuclein and thus triggering its aggregation and neuron-to-neuron propagation (a phenomenon referred to as  seeding ). Recent findings by scientists at the DZNE reveal that aggregation, spreading and pathology caused by alpha-synuclein do not necessarily involve prion-like seeding. Instead, they could be triggered by enhanced alpha-synuclein expression and trans-neuronal passage of monomeric and oligomeric forms of the protein. Researchers led by Prof. Donato Di Monte report on this in the journal BRAIN Abundant evidence underscores a critical role of the protein alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson s disease. In particular, alpha-synuclein is a major component of the intraneuronal inclusions, named Lewy bodies, that are progressively accumulated in the brains of patients with Parkinson s disease. Alpha-synuclein pathology often starts in a region of the lower brain called medulla oblongata from where it spreads upwardly toward midbrain and cortical areas. In the current study, sponsored in part by the Paul Foundation, DZNE researchers mimicked this phenomenon in mice. With the aid of a tailor-made viral vector, they transferred the blueprint of the human alpha-synuclein gene specifically into neurons in the mouse medulla oblongata. These cells then began producing and accumulating relatively large amounts of the exogenous (human) alpha-synuclein. Using specific antibodies that recognize human alpha-synuclein, Di Monte and his colleagues tracked the spreading of this protein throughout the mouse brain over a period of 6 to 12 weeks. They also compared spreading and pathology in normal mice, which expressed both exogenous (human) and endogenous alpha-synuclein, versus mutant mice lacking their endogenous protein.  In both groups of animals, increased expression of human alpha-synuclein resulted in its progressive diffusion from the medulla oblongata toward more rostral brain regions. This protein spreading involved at least one trans-synaptic jump and followed a stereotypical pattern consistent with diffusion via anatomically interconnected pathways. Furthermore, accumulation of the spreading protein within recipient neurons was accompanied by evidence of neuronal damage.  A prion-like seeding mechanism would predict that spreading of alpha-synuclein should be facilitated by interactions between abnormal forms of the protein generated within donor neurons and  uncorrupted  alpha-synuclein expressed within recipient cells.  In other words,  says Di Monte  we were expecting less efficient protein transmission and less pronounced pathology in mutant mice lacking endogenous alpha-synuclein. We were also expecting spreading and pathology to be associated with the accumulation of amyloidogenic alpha-synuclein; these are forms of the protein capable of producing insoluble fibrous aggregates.  Contrary to these predictions, spreading of alpha-synuclein was enhanced rather than being counteracted by ablation of the endogenous protein in mutant mice. Furthermore, trans-neuronal passage of non-fibrillar alpha-synuclein species was responsible for protein diffusion and triggered neuronal pathology. The researcher explains,  We believe that these findings bear a number of important implications for disease pathogenesis. Not only can we conclude that long-distance diffusion of alpha-synuclein does not necessarily require the generation of prion-like species. Our data also reveal that spreading and pathology can be triggered by simple overexpression of the protein and are mediated, at least initially, by monomeric and/or oligomeric alpha-synuclein.  The possibility that alpha-synuclein may behave like a prion has raised the speculation that, similar to some prion diseases (for example, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), cases of Parkinson s disease may arise from exposure to contagious protein species. Di Monte stresses:  There is absolutely no indication that Parkinson s could be a contagious disease. In fact, an important contribution of our new study is that it emphasizes how critical aspects of Parkinson s disease pathogenesis, such as neuron-to-neuron alpha-synuclein transmission and protein aggregation, can be explained by mechanisms that are not prion-like.  Di Monte and his colleagues at the DZNE intend to continue working on alpha-synuclein and are particularly interested in elucidating how alpha-synuclein could be targeted to slow down or halt the pathologic and clinical progression of the disease.

The study's findings open up new avenues for researchers to explore ways the brain can prevent disease expression, also known as resilience, with the hope of developing better treatments. Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic-depressive illness, is a brain disorder that causes fluctuations in patients' mood, energy, activity levels and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. Bipolar disorder is highly heritable, meaning that people with a parent or sibling with bipolar disorder have a much greater risk of developing the illness, compared with individuals with no family history. Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the connectivity patterns in the brains of three groups: patients with bipolar disorder, their siblings who did not develop the illness (resilient siblings), and unrelated healthy individuals. While having their brains scanned, each participant was asked to perform an emotional and a non-emotional task that taps into two different aspects of brain function known to be affected by bipolar disorder. The resilient siblings and the patients showed similar abnormalities in the connectivity of brain networks involved in emotional processing. However, the resilient siblings showed additional changes in brain wiring within these networks. ""The ability of the siblings to rewire their brain networks means they have adaptive neuroplasticity that may help them avoid the disease even though they still carry the genetic scar of bipolar disorder when they process emotional information,"" said Sophia Frangou, MD, PhD, Professor of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and lead author of the study. Frangou's ongoing research uses neuroimaging to study how differences in brain wiring can either increase or decrease the likelihood of developing mental health problems. ""A family history remains the greatest risk factor for developing bipolar disorder and while we often focus on risk, we may forget that the majority of those who fall into this category remain well,"" said Frangou. ""Looking for biological mechanisms that can protect against illness opens up a completely new direction for developing new treatments. Our research should give people hope that even though mental illness runs in families, it is possible to beat the odds at the genetic lottery.""

This technique, which can track changes in gene expression as cells differentiate, could be particularly useful for studying how stem cells or immune cells mature. It could also shed light on how cancer develops.  Existing methods allow for snapshot measurements of single-cell gene expression, which can provide very in-depth information. What this new approach offers is the ability to track cells over multiple generations and put this information in the context of a cell s lineal history,  says Robert Kimmerling, a graduate student in biological engineering and the lead author of a paper describing the technique. The paper s senior authors are Scott Manalis, the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor of Biological Engineering and a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and Alex Shalek, the Hermann L.F. von Helmholtz Career Development Assistant Professor of Health Sciences and Technology, an assistant professor of chemistry, and a member of MIT s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science. Capturing cell lineage The new method incorporates a recently developed technology called single-cell RNA-seq, which sequences the messenger RNA from a single cell. These RNAs, known collectively as the transcriptome, reveal which genes are being actively transcribed (that is, copied into messenger RNA instructions for building proteins) inside a cell at a given point in time. This helps scientists understand, for example, what makes a skin cell so different from a heart cell even though the cells share the same DNA.  Scientists have well established methods for resolving diverse subsets of a population, but one thing that s not very well worked out is how this diversity is generated. That s the key question we were targeting: how a single founding cell gives rise to very diverse progeny,  Kimmerling says. To try to answer that question, the researchers designed a microfluidic device that traps first an individual cell and then all of its descendants. The device has several connected channels, each of which has a trap that can capture a single cell. After the initial cell divides, its daughter cells flow further along the device and get trapped in the next channel. The researchers showed that they can capture up to five generations of cells this way and keep track of their relationships. To get the cells off the chip, the researchers temporarily reverse the direction of the fluid flowing across the chip, allowing them to remove the cells one at a time to perform single-cell RNA-seq. In this study, the researchers captured and sequenced immune cells called T cells. These cells are on constant alert in the body, and when they encounter a cell infected with a virus or bacterium, they leap into action, creating two distinct populations   effector T cells, which seek and destroy infected cells, and memory T cells, which retain a memory of the encounter and circulate in the body indefinitely in case of a subsequent encounter.  A single founding cell can give rise to both effector and memory cell subtypes, but how that diversity is generated isn t very clear,  Kimmerling says. The researchers analyzed RNA from recently activated T cells and two subsequent generations. When comparing genes with functions related to T cell activation and differentiation, they found that  sister  cells produced from the same division event are much more similar in their gene expression profiles than two unrelated cells. They also found that  cousin  cells, which have the same  grandmother,  are more similar than unrelated cells, which suggests unique, family-specific transcriptional profiles for single T cells. The researchers hope that future studies with this device could help to resolve the long-standing debate over how T cells differentiate into effector cells and memory cells. One theory is that the distinction occurs as early as the first T cell division following activation, while a competing theory suggests that the distinction happens later on, as a result of changes in the cells  microenvironment. To address this question, the researchers believe they would need to analyze the development of T cells taken from a mouse that had been exposed to a foreign pathogen, which would provide a useful model of T cell activation in response to infection. The new device could also be used to link RNA transcriptome information with other cell traits, the researchers say.  It opens up possibilities that have never been there before,  Manalis says.  We can further annotate single-cell transcriptome data by applying this strategy to our existing devices for measuring mass, growth rate, density, or deformability.   I think this is really beautiful work,  says Dean Felsher, a professor of medicine and pathology at Stanford University School of Medicine.  It builds on what Scott has been doing for a while, which is creating a whole new way of interrogating single-cell measurements. Now he can follow the progeny over multiple generations, which is really hard to do.  Cellular  age  In this study, the researchers also discovered that they could use their new technique to learn which genes are expressed at certain points during the cell division cycle. Because they trap each cell and have a record of when it last divided, they can directly link the  age  of each cell to its transcriptome. They identified a set of about 300 genes that correspond most with time since division (a proxy for cell cycle progression), and found that most of those genes were involved in cell division. Therefore, by measuring the levels of those 300 genes in similar cells, scientists should be able to estimate the ages of those cells. The researchers also found that a leukemia cell line, which proliferates continuously, has a different set of genes that appear to be driving cell division.  In the future, this approach may be able to provide insight into unique transcriptional regulators of cell cycle progression in various cancer models,  Kimmerling says.","Published: January 6, 2016"

The ORCAS field campaign -- led by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) -- will give scientists a rare look at how the air and seas surrounding Antarctica exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged between the air and the seas surrounding Antarctica. The data they collect will help illuminate the role the Southern Ocean plays in soaking up excess carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere. ""If we want to better predict the temperature in 50 years, we have to know how much carbon dioxide the oceans and terrestrial ecosystems are going to take up,"" said NCAR scientist Britton Stephens, co-lead principal investigator for ORCAS. ""Understanding the Southern Ocean's role is important because ocean circulation there provides a major opportunity for the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and the vast reservoir of the deep ocean."" Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas that contributes to human-caused global warming, moves continually back-and-forth among the atmosphere, plants on land and the oceans. As the burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the oceans have absorbed more of it. But it's unclear whether oceans can keep pace with continued emissions. Studies disagree about whether the Southern Ocean's ability to absorb carbon dioxide is speeding up or slowing down. Measurements and air samples collected by ORCAS -- which stands for the O2/N2 Ratio and CO2 Airborne Southern Ocean Study -- will give scientists critical data to help clarify what's actually happening in the remote and difficult-to-study region. NSF's Division of Polar Programs funds ORCAS through the U.S. Antarctic Program. That program supports researchers, coordinates all U.S. government research on Antarctica and provides the necessary logistical support for scientists. ""Building on decades of U.S. Antarctic Program research, new questions of global significance continue to emerge,"" said Peter Milne, program director of Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences in the Division of Polar Programs. ""ORCAS addresses one of those questions: how the Southern Ocean affects global climate by storing, or releasing, carbon dioxide, water vapor and heat."" Tracking carbon The ORCAS field campaign will operate out of Punta Arenas, near the southern tip of Chile. The researchers plan to use the NSF/NCAR HIAPER research aircraft to make 14 flights across parts of the Southern Ocean between Jan. 15 and Feb. 28. A suite of instruments on a modified Gulfstream V jet will measure the distribution of oxygen and carbon dioxide, as well as other gases produced by marine microorganisms, aerosols, and cloud characteristics in the atmosphere. The flights also will observe the ocean color -- which can indicate how much and what type of phytoplankton is growing in the water -- using NASA's Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM). NASA funded the addition of the PRISM instrument to the ORCAS campaign. Stephens and NCAR scientist Matthew Long are leading the science campaign. Other principal investigators include Elliot Atlas (University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science), Michelle Gierach (NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory), Ralph Keeling (Scripps Institution of Oceanography), Eric Kort (University of Michigan), and Colm Sweeney (Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences). CIRES is a partnership of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and University of Colorado Boulder. NCAR is also managing the field campaign, which includes logistics support, such as obtaining diplomatic clearances from multiple countries to fly through their airspace and providing housing and work space for the project'a scientists in South America. Carbon, oxygen and phytoplankton Measuring oxygen alongside carbon dioxide can give scientists a clearer picture than they would get from measuring carbon dioxide alone. ""The air-sea exchange of carbon dioxide is controlled not just by physics but also by biology,"" Long said. ""There's a nice relationship between the fluxes of oxygen and the fluxes of carbon dioxide that can be exploited to gain insight into these processes."" If scientists know how the two gases' concentrations change relative to one another with location and time, they can disentangle how biology and physics each affect the ocean's ability to absorb carbon dioxide. Physics and biology affect the ratio of carbon dioxide to oxygen in the air in different ways. In the Southern Hemisphere's austral spring, the warmth of the returning sun drives both carbon dioxide and oxygen out of the Southern Ocean surface and into the atmosphere. But the sunlight also triggers the growth of phytoplankton in the water. As organisms flourish, they take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen, causing the relative amounts of those two gases in the atmosphere to shift in opposite directions. Observations of these shifts can ultimately tell scientists how much carbon is going where and, more importantly, why. A window into the deep ocean The Southern Ocean is unique among Earth's oceans. Unimpeded by continental landmasses, and driven by a westerly wind, the Southern Ocean is able to form a circular current around Antarctica. This huge flow, the largest current on the planet, connects the adjacent Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. The complex interactions between this Antarctic Circumpolar Current and currents flowing in from other ocean basins creates an overturning circulation that brings deep water to the surface, where it can exchange gases with the atmosphere before it returns to depth. Once that surface water heads toward the ocean floor, it can stay sequestered in the deep ocean for hundreds or even thousands of years -- along with any carbon it carried. Data the ORCAS flights collect will help determine how much carbon dioxide goes along for the ride. ""The Southern Ocean provides a window into the deep ocean, but it's a difficult system to simulate in our Earth system models,"" Long said. ""It's remote, and so there has been a paucity of observations that can be used to improve the models we have."" The ORCAS team will use data generated during the field campaign to improve global computer models so they do a better job representing the Southern Ocean's complexities. The NCAR-managed data set will be publicly available. While the measurements made during the ORCAS campaign will help scientists fine-tune what they know so far about the Southern Ocean, the project could also bring to light entirely new aspects of how the ocean works. ""The Southern Ocean is very inaccessible and existing measurements are from ships or surface stations that represent only a few tiny dots on a huge map,"" Stephens said. ""The airborne measurements we take will be helpful in terms of understanding the system better. And because we're doing something that no one's ever done before, we're likely to find things that we aren't expecting.""","Published: January 6, 2016"

Municipal water treatment facilities put wastewater   that is, any water that is collected by the sewage system, everything from households to street drains   through a gauntlet of processes that physically and chemically strain out or otherwise neutralize the bits deemed hazardous to humans or damaging to the environment before it is returned to the nearest stream or river.  Christopher Sales, PhD, an assistant professor in the College of Engineering and a member of the research team at the A.J. Drexel Institute for Energy and the Environment, aims to improve wastewater treatment with a little help from algae and its symbiotic relationship with the bacteria to remove excess nitrogen from water. One of the most time-consuming and expensive components to wastewater treatment today is ridding water of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which often make their way into water from our household toilets and sinks,  Sales said.  It s an essential step because the release of excess nitrogen species into a water supply can lead to accelerated growth of cyanobacteria and algae   and create a massive algal bloom like the one in Lake Erie last summer which caused the contamination of the entire water supply of Toledo, Ohio.  In 2006, Sales, along with a colleague from the University of Pennsylvania, developed a water treatment device, called a high density bioreactor, that can cultivate a dense mixture of microorganisms   called activated sludge   which are used to remove oxygen organic carbon compounds from wastewater. Since then Sales and his lab at Drexel have added algae to the mix to improve the reactor s nitrogen-removal capabilities and allow for the recovery of a potentially valuable resource: algal biomass. This development is quite significant because today s predominant nitrogen-removal techniques involve multi-step processes that push water through as many as four different tanks and require a period of time for nitrogen-removing bacteria to settle of out of the water. In the first step of this involved process, oxygen is bubbled into the water to convert dissolved nitrogen into is chemical cousin, nitrate. The water is then mixed with bacteria that use the nitrate for respiration and expel it into the atmosphere as nitrogen gas   much like humans breathe oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Then, after the bacteria have done their job, the water is pumped into another tank until they ve settled out and the treated effluent can be released into the nearest body of water. This process is both energy intensive and it requires a large facility to accommodate tanks for nitrification, denitrification and settling.   The process of nitrification requires a significant amount of energy because the tanks of nitrifying bacteria need to be constantly aerated to provide oxygen to drive the conversion of ammonium to nitrate,  Sales said.  Similarly, wastewater treatment plants often need to add chemicals, such as methanol, to provide denitryfing bacteria with enough food to transform the nitrate from the nitrification process into nitrogen gas.  By contrast, Sales s bioreactor works by continuously cycling water into an algae and bacteria-laden environment, removing nitrogen by storing it in algae that can be easily separated from water in their new reactor. His data indicates that it can remove up to 80 percent of nitrogen from a waste stream. In addition, Sales s system does not require a separate settling tank because the flow of the reactor is designed to naturally promote settling of biomass. This separation, Sales speculates, could one day make the algae cultivated in these bioreactors an appealing source of biofuel feedstock because it wouldn t require as much energy to dry out as pond-grown algae. The lab-scale prototype looks like a rather elaborate chemistry experiment   which it is, essentially. A 1000-milliliter graduated cylinder filled with a gradient of green liquid is the centerpiece of a plumbing circuit that begins in a water jug of synthetic wastewater, feeds through a pump, a bubbling beaker and eventually through the flask of algae and bacteria before emptying into a bucket as  treated effluent.  Wastewater enters the bioreactor with high concentrations of ammonia and nitrate due to their presence in raw and processed wastewater. A diverse microbial community, composed of some 350 different species, can either metabolize ammonia to nitrate or convert dead algal cells into carbon dioxide. The algae use these byproducts to grow and perform photosynthesis, which, in turn, produces oxygen that helps the bacteria thrive. Thus the cycle removes nitrogen from wastewater while also growing a healthy crop of algae and bacteria.  Our wastewater is actually the perfect environment for algae and bacteria to thrive in a symbiotic circle of life,  said Jacob Price a doctoral researcher in Sales s lab.  Nitrate is a common ingredient in fertilizers. Plants use it, along with carbon dioxide and light, through the process of photosynthesis and carbon fixation, to fuel growth. A byproduct of photosynthesis is oxygen, which is used by organisms   like bacteria   for their commensurate life processes. It s a beautifully natural relationship that we can harness to clean our water. ","Published: January 6, 2016"

This bioinspired advance takes a biophysical approach to assaying blood by subjecting blood samples to the same fluid shear stresses and force gradients it experiences inside a patient s vascular network. It can be used with blood samples or potentially be integrated into patients  blood flow lines, so that one day clinicians could have the foresight they need to prevent life-threatening events such as blood clotting or internal hemorrhaging. The Wyss Institute team led by Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., has developed a novel microfluidic device in which blood flows through a life-like network of small  vessels , where it is subjected to true-to-life shear stresses and force gradients of the human vascular network. Using automated pressure sensors and a proprietary algorithm developed by the Wyss team, data acquired from the device is analyzed in real-time, precisely predicting the time at which a certain blood sample will obstruct the blood vessel network. Known clinically as hemostasis, the body s ability to stop bleeding is critical for survival. For a patient who has a blood clotting disorder or medical condition requiring the use of anticoagulation and antiplatelet drugs, or someone who requires treatment with extracorporeal devices that circulate their blood outside of their body, it is essential that care providers can rapidly monitor their body s ability to maintain healthy hemostasis while preventing clotting.  The physics of what s happening inside our bodies is a major contributor to the reasons why blood clots form or why clotting fails during surgeries, traumas, or extracorporeal medical procedures,  said Abhishek Jain, Ph.D., a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Wyss Institute and the Division of Hemostasis and Thrombosis at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard Medical School, and the lead author on new study.  By mimicking the physics of blood clotting in our device more precisely, we hope this technology can one day be used to save lives.  The device contains hollow channels that mimic the pathology of the narrowing of small blood vessels, which occurs in patients as a side effect of medical conditions or treatments and can often cause a shift in the fluid mechanics of blood flow that can lead to life-threatening blood clots or internal bleeds.  By combining our fabricated microfluidic device that mimics blood flow dynamics of small arterioles with our novel data analysis software,  we can rapidly quantitate hemostasis in real-time and predict if blood clots will develop in an individual or blood sample,  said Ingber, who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Using the Wyss team s hemostasis monitoring microdevice, blood clot formation and platelet function can be precisely monitored. The real-time monitoring ability of the device could also assess patients  coagulation status almost continuously, in stark contrast to today s standard of once or twice a day testing procedures, thereby reducing the likelihood of toxic side effects resulting from anticoagulation therapies. The team also demonstrated that the device can detect abnormal platelet function in patients with a rare bleeding disorder that can not be easily identified using conventional assays. The device could even potentially be used as a companion diagnostic in clinical trials to test and validate the effect of new therapeutics. In a large animal experiment already conducted, the team perfused blood directly from a living vessel into a microfluidic device to measure clinical clotting parameters over time, and they recorded precise predictions for clotting times for blood samples that were far more accurate and faster than currently-used clinical assays. The Wyss Institute s hemostasis monitoring device has been developed with translation and versatility in mind, and it uses inexpensive in-line pressure sensors to measure clot formation. As a result, the device does not require additional instrumentation and it can be integrated directly into the blood lines of extracorporeal devices.  The ability of the device to be configured for lab use or real-time patient monitoring opens the door for countless potential uses to be developed to leverage its coagulation assaying power towards improving patient care.","Published: January 6, 2016"

But, the race to find a cure and therapies to combat the disease are forging ahead as officials warn that inattention could lead to another epidemic. Texas Biomedical Research Institute scientists have been working on therapies, diagnostics and vaccines for years before the 2014 epidemic, and a recent study by Dr. Anthony Griffiths shows a promising mechanism for attacking the virus.  In the paper, titled Determination and Therapeutic Exploitation of Ebola Virus Spontaneous Mutation Frequency, Dr. Griffiths explains how ""typically, RNA viruses have high spontaneous mutation rates, which permit rapid evolution and the ability to adapt to new selection pressures. These selection pressures can include antiviral drugs, the immune system, or even new animal hosts."" However, it was unknown whether filoviruses exhibit high mutation frequencies. ""When we started this work, there was not an appreciation that Ebola virus had any capacity to evolve and if those changes would be well tolerated,"" Griffiths explained. Griffiths and his team, that included graduate student Kendra Alfson, used ultra deep sequencing to reveal that the spontaneous mutation frequency for Ebola virus was high and similar to other RNA viruses. However, ""We found that Ebola virus had very limited ability to tolerate spontaneous changes in the genome, thus it was reasoned that chemically increasing the mutation frequency may decrease the number of viable virions released from a cell."" Essentially, Ebola virus has the potential to evolve rapidly but the genetic changes result in viruses that are weakened or not viable. Due to the unprecedented numbers of individuals infected in the latest outbreak, we have learned that Ebola virus does evolve in humans. Therefore, a better understanding of the capacity of the virus to evolve could lead to better diagnostics and potential therapies. ""Any change in a genome can be neutral, negative, or positive to a virus,"" Griffiths explained. He added that ""interestingly, viruses appear to have evolved to have an optimal mutation rate. Increasing the mutation rate could produce a negative effect on the virus and serve as a valuable therapeutic tool."" To determine whether Ebola virus was sensitive to increasing mutation rate, Griffiths' group tested a drug called ribavirin. Preliminary experiments with mice suggested ribavirin could be a potential therapy and did cause the desired effect of increasing the mutation frequency enough to make the virus non-viable. Further testing in monkeys showed ribavirin reduced production of infectious Ebola virus but results were not strong enough to recommend ribavirin as a treatment protocol. ""Now we have shown the potential of modifying mutation rate as a therapeutic tool for Ebola virus infections,"" Griffiths said. ""We plan to test other drugs in the hope of improving the efficacy observed using ribavirin.""","Published: January 6, 2016"

Take, for instance, the branching fractals seen in both tree limbs and blood vessels, or the surprisingly similar spirals in mollusks and cabbage. Now scientists at MIT and Cambridge University have identified an unexpected shared pattern in the collective movement of bacteria and electrons: As billions of bacteria stream through a microfluidic lattice, they synchronize and swim in patterns similar to those of electrons orbiting around atomic nuclei in a magnetic material. The researchers found that by tuning certain dimensions of the microfluidic lattice, they were able to direct billions of microbes to align and swim in the same direction, much the way electrons circulate in the same direction when they create a magnetic field. With slight changes to the lattice, groups of bacteria flowed in opposite directions, resembling electrons in a nonmagnetic material. Surprisingly, the researchers also identified a mathematical model that applies to the motions of both bacteria and electrons. The model derives from a general lattice field theory, which is typically used to describe the quantum behavior of electrons in magnetic and electronic materials. The researchers reduced this complex model to a much simpler,  textbook  model, which predicts that a phase transition, or a change in flow direction, should occur with certain changes to a lattice s dimensions   a transition that the team observed in their experiments with bacteria.  It s very surprising that we see this universality,  says J rn Dunkel, assistant professor of applied mathematics at MIT.  The really nice thing is, you have a living system here that shows all these behaviors that people think are also going on in quantum systems.  Dunkel and his colleagues at Cambridge University   Hugo Wioland, Francis Woodhouse, and Raymond Goldstein  83   published their results in the journal Nature Physics. Guiding bacterial surfacesDunkel first began looking into the swimming patterns of bacteria as a postdoc with the Cambridge University group led by Goldstein. The researchers were exploring how to manipulate bacterial flow, as a way to prevent biofilms   dense layers of microbial slime that can take over shower stalls, clog filtration systems, and cling to ship hulls.  We were generally interested in how microbes like bacteria interact with surfaces individually and collectively, and how might surfaces guide microorganisms,  Dunkel says. In initial experiments, the researchers placed bacteria in progressively smaller pools, or wells, and observed their swimming patterns. In larger wells, the microbes tended to swim in relative disorder. In much smaller wells, measuring about 70 microns wide, thousands of bacteria began to behave in orderly way, swimming in a spiral, in the same direction within the well, for long periods of time. Against the currentIn the new study, the researchers observed bacteria flowing through an interconnected array of these small wells. Made of a transparent, rubber-like polymer, the lattice is composed of 100 wells, each measuring 70 microns and connected to its neighbors by a small channel. They injected bacteria into the array and observed the direction in which bacteria flowed within each well. Dunkel and his colleagues found that they were able to manipulate the bacteria s flow by changing one key dimension: the diameter of the connecting channels, or what they call gap size. If the gap was too small, bacteria in one well would spiral in the opposite direction from their neighbors in the adjacent well, like the alternating circulation of electrons in a nonmagnetic material. If, however, the gap size was 8 microns or larger, the researchers observed a phase transition, in which bacteria in every well synchronized, flowing in the same direction, like aligned electrons in a magnetic field. Examining this phase transition more closely, the researchers found that a larger gap size allows more bacteria to flow from one well to a neighboring well. This movement of bacteria between wells creates an  edge current,  or a flow of bacteria at the edges of each well, which in turn induces bacteria in the well s interior to flow against it. The overall result is that the majority of bacteria within each well flow in the same direction, opposite to the edge currents. Modeling collective motionTo see whether the similar motions of bacteria and electrons bear out mathematically, Dunkel and his colleagues looked to lattice field theory, the model typically applied to describe the behavior of electrons in quantum systems. They reduced this more complicated model to the Ising model   a  textbook  model used to describe the spin of electrons within a two-dimensional square lattice similar to the microfluidic lattice fabricated by the researchers. Applying the Ising model to their physical lattice, the researchers found that the model predicted a phase transition in response to a change in one parameter, which, in this case, turned out to be gap size. Dunkel and his colleagues found that the model predictions matched their experiments in a square lattice. The group also studied bacteria flowing through a triangular lattice   a repeating pattern of three interconnected wells   and found that, again, theoretical expectations matched observations. Going forward, Dunkel says he would like to explore bacterial flow in more random arrangements and environments.  In real porous medium like soil or tissue, you don t have this very even distribution of bacteria,  Dunkel says.  So how is collective motion of bacteria controlled by randomness of the medium? That s the next bigger goal.  This research was funded, in part, by an European Research Council Advanced Investigator Grant 247333 (R.G. and F.

They note, however, that these effects of Wnt5a were blocked by a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for ROR1, called cirmtuzumab (or UC-961), which inhibited the growth and spread of CLL cells in both cell lines and mouse models of leukemia.  Although the findings are made with leukemia cells, researchers said the study has implications for patients with other cancers, including solid-tissue tumors. ROR1 and ROR2 are considered  orphan receptors,  which are expressed primarily during embryonic development. The expression of these proteins, particularly ROR1, becomes suppressed during fetal development and is negligible on normal adult tissues. However, CLL and many solid tissue cancers re-express these orphan receptors.  Our findings show that ROR1 and ROR2 team up to stimulate tumor cell growth and metastasis in response to Wnt5a, which appears over-expressed in patients with CLL and can act as a survival/growth factor for leukemia cells. By blocking the capacity of Wnt5a to stimulate tumor cells, cirmtuzumab can inhibit the growth and spread of cancer cells,  said senior author Thomas J. Kipps, MD, PhD, Evelyn and Edwin Tasch Chair in Cancer Research and deputy director for research at Moores Cancer Center.  We now have better insight into how cirmtuzumab works against leukemia cells. This should help find better ways to treat patients who have other cancers with cirmtuzumab, which currently is being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial for patients with CLL.

The study suggests that patients with HER2-positive breast cancer   which accounts for roughly 20 percent of the 260,000 invasive breast cancers diagnosed in the US each year   might someday undergo immune status monitoring with blood tests before, during and after treatment, to allow physicians to gauge the risk of recurrence, and possibly to reduce that risk with therapies that boost anti-HER2 immunity.  We know that it s not a fixed immune defect, because we have several clinical trials open where we re vaccinating people and can restore anti-HER2 responsivity,  said the study s senior author Brian J. Czerniecki, MD, PhD, the Rhodes-Harrington Professor in Surgical Oncology at Penn and the co-director of the Rena Rowan Breast Center at Penn s Abramson Cancer Center. An Immune Marker for Recurrence Risk Czerniecki and colleagues have been investigating the role of the immune system in breast cancer, and the potential of cancer vaccines, for most of the past two decades. Their most recent research has focused on the T-helper type 1, or Th1, immune response in cancer, in which  helper  T cells mobilize killer cells to attack cancer-related targets. In the new study, the Penn team, including first author Jashodeep Datta, MD, a general surgery resident and a member of the Czerniecki laboratory, isolated immune cells from 95 women with invasive HER2-positive breast cancer, and analyzed the cells  ability to mount a Th1 response against the HER2 growth factor receptor protein. HER2-positive breast cancer cells overexpress the HER2 receptor to help drive their rapid proliferation. The team found that, by a standard measure, the cells from women with recently recurrent cancer that had not yet been re-treated had only about a tenth of the anti-HER2 responsivity compared to that seen in women whose HER2+ breast cancer had not recurred for at least two years following treatment. Looking at anti-HER2 responsivity across all the patients, the researchers found that patients with the least amount of responsivity had experienced only 47 disease-free months after treatment, on average, compared to 113 disease-free months for the patients in with the most responsivity. The low anti-HER2 responsivity seen in the women with recurrent cancer was not part of a broader immune suppression.  We detected no other immune deficit   just the deficit in the anti-HER2 response,  Czerniecki said. The findings complement those from two other studies published earlier this year by Czerniecki and his colleagues. In one, the scientists found that the Th1 responsivity against HER2 tends to vary strikingly from high responsivity in cancer-free and early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer patients, to low responsivity in advanced HER2-positive breast cancer patients. In the other study, patients whose tumors shrank during standard pre-surgery drug treatment had much stronger anti-HER2 responsivity, compared to patients whose tumors responded less completely to that drug treatment. How patients lose their anti-HER2 responsivity during the formation and growth of a HER2-positive tumor isn t yet clear.  The thinking is that the patient s anti-HER2 T cells somehow become exhausted and die or otherwise stop responding,  Czerniecki said.  We re trying to determine the mechanism, but we already know that we can  fill the tank  with vaccines to restore that specific responsivity to HER2.  In addition to conducting ongoing mechanistic studies and vaccine trials, Czerniecki says his team hopes to confirm the association between anti-HER2 responsivity and cancer recurrence risk in larger clinical trials that would track patients  immune status over time.","Published: January 6, 2016"

It is a finding that may lay the foundation for new colorectal cancer treatments. ""The gene known as Sprouty2 has previously been shown to protect against metastasis, or the spreading of cancer to other parts of the body, in breast, prostate and liver cancer,"" said Sharad Khare, Ph.D., associate professor of research in the MU School of Medicine's Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology and lead author of the study. ""However, our recent molecular studies found that this gene may actually help promote metastasis instead of suppress it.""For more than three years, Khare studied Sprouty2 in cancer cell models, mouse models and human biopsy samples. Using different molecular methods, the researchers found that the gene functions differently in colorectal cancer than in other types of cancers. Sprouty2 is known to block molecular circuits to prevent cancer cells from growing and spreading to other parts of the body. However, the researchers found that in colorectal cancer, Sprouty2 may increase the metastatic ability of cancer cells instead of suppress it. Khare believes this occurs when the gene is up-regulated, or supercharged. Cancer deaths attributed to colorectal cancer are mainly due to tumor recurrence and metastasis to other organs. Excluding skin cancers, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society. It's estimated that the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 20. ""This finding is a very significant step in our understanding of metastasis in colorectal cancer, but it's important to note that we believe this phenomenon may occur in only a subset of colorectal cancer patients,"" Khare said. ""We don't yet know why this is the case, but we hope to determine if there is a correlation between the up-regulation of this gene and the life expectancy of patients with colorectal cancer. Future studies will help us understand who may be at risk, and ultimately, if personalized treatments can be planned to target this gene.""","Published: January 6, 2016"

Berkeley Lab researchers are using M. thermoacetica to perform photosynthesis   despite being non-photosynthetic   and also to synthesize semiconductor nanoparticles in a hybrid artificial photosynthesis system for converting sunlight into valuable chemical products.  We ve demonstrated the first self-photosensitization of a non-photosynthetic bacterium, M. thermoacetica, with cadmium sulfide nanoparticles to produce acetic acid from carbon dioxide at efficiencies and yield that are comparable to or may even exceed the capabilities of natural photosynthesis,  says Peidong Yang, a chemist with Berkeley Lab s Materials Sciences Division, who led this work. The bacteria/inorganic-semiconductor hybrid artificial photosynthesis system we ve created is self-replicating through the bio-precipitation of cadmium sulfide nanoparticles, which serve as the light harvester to sustain cellular metabolism,  Yang says.  Demonstrating this cyborgian ability to self-augment the functionality of biological systems through inorganic chemistry opens up the integration of biotic and abiotic components for the next generation of advanced solar-to-chemical conversion technologies.  Yang, who also holds appointments with UC Berkeley and the Kavli Energy NanoScience Institute (Kavli-ENSI) at Berkeley, is the corresponding author of a paper describing this research. The paper is titled  Self-photosensitization of non-photosynthetic bacteria for solar-to-chemical production.  Co-authors are Kelsey Sakimoto and Andrew Barnabas Wong. Photosynthesis is the process by which nature harvests sunlight and uses the solar energy to synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water. Artificial versions of photosynthesis are being explored for the clean, green and sustainable production of chemical products now made from petroleum, primarily fuels and plastics. Yang and his research group have been at the forefront of developing artificial photosynthetic technologies that can realize the full potential of solar-to-chemical synthesis.  In our latest study, we combined the highly efficient light harvesting of an inorganic semiconductor with the high specificity, low cost, and self-replication and self-repair of a biocatalyst,  Yang says.  By inducing the self-photosensitization of M. thermoacetica with cadmium sulfide nanoparticles, we enabled the photosynthesis of acetic acid from carbon dioxide over several days of light-dark cycles at relatively high quantum yields, demonstrating a self-replicating route toward solar-to-chemical carbon dioxide reduction.  Cadmium sulfide is a well-studied semiconductor with a band structure and that is well-suited for photosynthesis. As both an  electrograph  (meaning it can undergo direct electron transfers from an electrode), and an  acetogen  (meaning it can direct nearly 90-percent of its photosynthetic products towards acetic acid), M. thermoacetica serves as the ideal model organism for demonstrating the capabilities of this hybrid artificial photosynthesis system.  Our hybrid system combines the best of both worlds: the light-harvesting capabilities of semiconductors with the catalytic power of biology,  Yang says.  In this study, we ve demonstrated not only that biomaterials can be of sufficient quality to carry out useful photochemistry, but that in some ways they may be even more advantageous in biological applications.

A modified enzyme that gains strength from being protected within the protein shell -- or ""capsid"" -- of a bacterial virus, this new material is 150 times more efficient than the unaltered form of the enzyme. ""Essentially, we've taken a virus's ability to self-assemble myriad genetic building blocks and incorporated a very fragile and sensitive enzyme with the remarkable property of taking in protons and spitting out hydrogen gas,"" said Trevor Douglas, the Earl Blough Professor of Chemistry in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Chemistry, who led the study. ""The end result is a virus-like particle that behaves the same as a highly sophisticated material that catalyzes the production of hydrogen."" Other IU scientists who contributed to the research were Megan C. Thielges, an assistant professor of chemistry; Ethan J. Edwards, a Ph.D. student; and Paul C. Jordan, a postdoctoral researcher at Alios BioPharma, who was an IU Ph.D. student at the time of the study. The genetic material used to create the enzyme, hydrogenase, is produced by two genes from the common bacteria Escherichia coli, inserted inside the protective capsid using methods previously developed by these IU scientists. The genes, hyaA and hyaB, are two genes in E. coli that encode key subunits of the hydrogenase enzyme. The capsid comes from the bacterial virus known as bacteriophage P22. The resulting biomaterial, called ""P22-Hyd,"" is not only more efficient than the unaltered enzyme but also is produced through a simple fermentation process at room temperature. The material is potentially far less expensive and more environmentally friendly to produce than other materials currently used to create fuel cells. The costly and rare metal platinum, for example, is commonly used to catalyze hydrogen as fuel in products such as high-end concept cars. ""This material is comparable to platinum, except it's truly renewable,"" Douglas said. ""You don't need to mine it; you can create it at room temperature on a massive scale using fermentation technology; it's biodegradable. It's a very green process to make a very high-end sustainable material."" In addition, P22-Hyd both breaks the chemical bonds of water to create hydrogen and also works in reverse to recombine hydrogen and oxygen to generate power. ""The reaction runs both ways -- it can be used either as a hydrogen production catalyst or as a fuel cell catalyst,"" Douglas said. The form of hydrogenase is one of three occurring in nature: di-iron (FeFe)-, iron-only (Fe-only)- and nitrogen-iron (NiFe)-hydrogenase. The third form was selected for the new material due to its ability to easily integrate into biomaterials and tolerate exposure to oxygen. NiFe-hydrogenase also gains significantly greater resistance upon encapsulation to breakdown from chemicals in the environment, and it retains the ability to catalyze at room temperature. Unaltered NiFe-hydrogenase, by contrast, is highly susceptible to destruction from chemicals in the environment and breaks down at temperatures above room temperature -- both of which make the unprotected enzyme a poor choice for use in manufacturing and commercial products such as cars. These sensitivities are ""some of the key reasons enzymes haven't previously lived up to their promise in technology,"" Douglas said. Another is their difficulty to produce. ""No one's ever had a way to create a large enough amount of this hydrogenase despite its incredible potential for biofuel production. But now we've got a method to stabilize and produce high quantities of the material -- and enormous increases in efficiency,"" he said. The development is highly significant according to Seung-Wuk Lee, professor of bioengineering at the University of California-Berkeley, who was not a part of the study. ""Douglas' group has been leading protein- or virus-based nanomaterial development for the last two decades. This is a new pioneering work to produce green and clean fuels to tackle the real-world energy problem that we face today and make an immediate impact in our life in the near future,  said Lee, whose work has been cited in a U.S. Congressional report on the use of viruses in manufacturing. Beyond the new study, Douglas and his colleagues continue to craft P22-Hyd into an ideal ingredient for hydrogen power by investigating ways to activate a catalytic reaction with sunlight, as opposed to introducing elections using laboratory methods. ""Incorporating this material into a solar-powered system is the next step,"" Douglas said.","Published: January 6, 2016"

In the study, the brains of 26 healthy volunteers were monitored before and after multiple computerized training sessions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During the training, participants were required to identify whether a target arrow points to the right or to the left, while ignoring the direction of arrows on either side of it. The researchers conducted a ""resting-state fMRI scan"" to assess connections between brain regions during no specific task and later during an emotional reactivity task in which they had to ignore negative pictures used to study emotion. ""As expected, participants who completed the more intense version of the training (but not the other participants) showed reduced activation in their amygdala a brain region involved in negative emotions, including sadness and anxiety. In addition, the intense training resulted in increased connectivity between participants' amygdala and a region in the frontal cortex shown to be involved in emotion regulation,"" said Dr. Cohen, who collaborated with Dr. Hadas Okon-Singer from the University of Haifa and the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Germany.

Aberrant membrane composition is observed in numerous diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.  Understanding membrane composition and its regulation is an important step toward developing effective therapeutics to target and penetrate the abnormal membrane of cancer cells. There are challenges to studying lipid dynamics in living organisms. The membrane lipids are tremendously diverse and they are not genetically encoded.  Therefore, the ideal way to investigate how a membrane is maintained over time is to manipulate a relatively simple model organism such as the worm, Caenorhabditis elegans.  Another feature of membrane lipids is that they are in constant flux; however, there are no established methods to quantify the dynamics of each individual population. Researchers in the lab of Dr. Carissa Olsen (Basic Sciences Division) are able to track lipid dynamics in great detail using a method they developed in which worms are fed a diet enriched for heavy carbon, 13C, and then, following a defined growth period, lipids are isolated for identification by mass-spectrometry.  Previous work from the lab has demonstrated that the 13C label can be used to detect all major species of fatty acids, the tails of lipid molecules. In recent work they have extended their analysis of the lipidome all of the lipids in the cell and outline a new method that uses heavy nitrogen (15N) to track intact phospholipids. Using heavy carbon labeling and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GS-MS), the authors were able to quantitatively track how much of each lipid species in the membrane is replaced over time.  The rates they measured for each fatty acid predicted that the majority of the fatty acids in the membrane are replaced within twenty-four hours. They found good agreement between their predictions and the actual measurements of replenishment for most fatty acid species, however some fatty acids were not completely replaced in twenty-four hours.  This demonstrates that some fatty acids are protected, either actively or inactively, from removal. Fatty acid tails are found in polar phospholipids that make up the bilayer and are also found in neutral fat-storage lipids such as the common triacylglycerols.  In order to track whether these two groups of lipids have different dynamics, the authors physically separated them before analysis of each group by GC-MS.  Strikingly, they found that phospholipid maintenance consumes more dietary resources than neutral lipids, which are, on average, replaced roughly half as quickly.  This observation underscores the importance of preserving membranes over maintaining fat stores in adult animals.  Labeled carbon can come from two sources, either the fully labeled fatty acids from the diet or from de novo synthesis, which generates fatty acids with a mixture of labeled to unlabeled carbon.  After mathematically separating these two groups during their analysis, the authors found that in general most of the new fatty acids incorporated into the membrane come directly from dietary sources, although synthesis did account for a significant portion of the population.  Because the fatty acids in the cell membrane are attached to a phospho-glycerol backbone, directly measuring intact phospholipids rather than their isolated fatty acid tails would give a better picture of membrane dynamics.  In order to do this, the authors turned to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry.  The substantial amount of variation in phospholipid species prompted the researchers to label only a single atom, the nitrogen in the polar head group with a heavy isotope,15N.  They analyzed the most common phospholipid classes in the worm membrane, phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphotidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), and found that PtdEtn phospholipids are exchanged nearly three times the rate of the PtdCho group.  This disparity in turnover rates highlights the importance of monitoring the dynamics of individual populations and how they are differentially regulated.  Indeed, the methods put forth in this research provide a new framework for beginning to dissect the genetics and biochemistry of membrane dynamics.","Published: January 5, 2016"

Given the emergence of artemisinin resistance, these findings could potentially lead to the design of new treatments against drug-resistant parasites. Assistant Professor Lin Qingsong, who is from the Department of Biological Sciences under the NUS Faculty of Science and is one of the scientists who led the study, explained,  Many people may not realise that more human lives are lost to the tiny mosquito, more specifically malaria parasites, each year as compared to ferocious animals such as lions and sharks. After infection, malaria parasites, known for their blood-eating nature, can propagate inside the human body rapidly and consume up to 80 per cent of red blood cells in a short period of time, leading to a series of deadly symptoms.  About 3.2 billion people   almost half of the world s population   are considered to be at risk of malaria by the World Health Organization. As of September 2015, there were an estimated 214 million cases of malaria and 438,000 malaria-linked deaths this year alone. Artemisinin and its derivatives are currently the most potent class of anti-malarial drugs. In recognition of its importance against malaria, the discovery of artemisinin won Chinese scientist Ms Tu Youyou the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine earlier in October this year. While there have been extensive studies on artemisinin, the mechanism of the drug is not well understood. Asst Prof Lin, together with Dr Wang Jigang, who was formerly with the NUS Department of Biological Sciences and now with the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research & Technology, Associate Professor Kevin Tan from the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and their research team, discovered over 120 protein targets of artemisinin, and the mechanism that activates its deadly killing effect.  How artemisinin works Previously, only two targets of artemisinin have been identified, and their correlation with the powerful parasite-killing effect of the drug has been questioned. This latest study by the NUS team has identified 124 protein targets of artemisinin in Plasmodium falciparum, the most pathogenic malaria parasite to infect humans.  With artemisinin resistance in malaria parasites becoming an emerging concern, particularly in Southeast Asia, our study could potentially contribute to the design of better drugs and treatment strategies against malaria,  said Assoc Prof Tan. Many of the newly-identified protein targets are involved in essential biological processes in the parasite, thus explaining its potent killing effect. Through its promiscuous targeting mechanism, artemisinin targets the blood-eating nature of the malaria parasite, binding to a broad spectrum of targets simultaneously, and fatally disrupting the biochemistry of the parasite. The study also showed that the main activator of artemisinin is haem, a specific iron-containing compound, either biosynthesised by the parasite at its early developmental ring stage, or derived from haemoglobin digestion in the later stages. The drug activation level was found to be much lower in ring stage parasites, given that artemisinin activation requires haem, which is of much lower abundance and is biosynthesised by the parasite. In comparison, during the late stages of its life cycle, the parasite actively digests the haemoglobin in infected blood cells as its primary energy source. This releases large amounts of haem, and the drug is thus able to specifically respond to parasite-infected cells and effectively attack the disease-causing parasites. Paving the way for new treatment strategies against malaria Asst Prof Lin added,  The current findings not only provide a more complete picture of how artemisinin and its derivatives work, but also suggest new ways of using the drug. For instance, to improve drug activation at ring stage, we can explore enhancing the level of haem biosynthesis in the parasite. By understanding that haemoglobin digestion releases huge amount of haem, which brings about the effective killing mechanism in the later stages, we can also consider prolonging the treatment time to ensure that the drug can effectively kill the parasite through multiple cycles.  The team will be collaborating with researchers from NUS  Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering to develop novel artemisinin analogues with more specific targeting properties.  Moving forward, structural biology and physicochemical studies will help us to understand how exactly the drug binds to its protein targets and how these modifications of proteins affect their structures and hence their functions,  said Dr Wang.","Published: January 5, 2016"

However, because each individual rare disease affects a very small percentage of the population, this has hampered scientists' ability to study them for reasons ranging from inadequate sample sizes to lack of funding. It has only been in the last 30 years that researchers have begun to make a concerted effort to develop tests and treatments for these conditions, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders. CDGs and metachromatic leukodystrophy are two such rare diseases for which optimal testing and treatment still do not exist. A Test to Distinguish Between Types of CDG A team of researchers led by Miao He, PhD, of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, set out to change this by developing a more efficient test for the three most common CDG subtypes: ALG1-CDG, PMM2-CDG, and MPI-CDG. All CDGs are characterized by defects in the body's ability to form glycoproteins or glycolipids (proteins and fats with sugar attachments that serve critical functions in all tissues and organs) and the current test for CDGs detects alterations in the glycoprotein transferrin. However, this fails to distinguish between CDG subtypes.   He's team has discovered that the presence of a novel N-tetrasaccharide along with levels of N-linked Man3GlcNAc2 (two types of sugar found in the body) can be used to diagnose ALG1-CDG, PMM2-CDG, and MPI-CDG, and to differentiate patients with ALG1-CDG from those with PMM2-CDG or MPI-CDG. To determine this, the researchers first compared the sugars found in CDG patients with those in healthy people to identify potential indicators of CDG. Once they zeroed in on the N-tetrasaccharide and Man3GlcNAc2, they used a lab technique known as liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to test for these sugars in 31 patients with one of the three CDG subtypes and in 20 unaffected individuals. This confirmed that the N-tetrasaccharide only appeared in the CDG patients; additionally, Man3GlcNAc2 levels were elevated in PMM2-CDG and MPI-CDG patients, but found at normal or low levels in ALG1-CDG patients. Significantly, He's group also observed that the N-tetrasaccharide's levels went down after treating an MPI-CDG patient with the sugar mannose as well as after incubating ALG1-CDG patient cells in a solution of mannose. Currently, MPI-CDG is the only CDG subtype with a known treatment. This result indicates that future studies could use the N-tetrasaccharide test to investigate whether mannose is an effective treatment for ALG1-CDG as well, and to aid in the development of much-needed treatments for the other CDGs. Making Newborn Screening Possible for Metachromatic Leukodystrophy A second team of researchers led by Michael H. Gelb, PhD, of the University of Washington, Seattle, has created a test that could enable all infants in the U.S. to get screened for metachromatic leukodystrophy and receive prompt treatment to halt the cognitive deterioration it causes. In patients with this condition, a fatty substance known as sulfatide accumulates in the brain and other areas of the body. Previous studies had shown, however, that concentrations of sulfatides in dried blood the sample type used by newborn screening programs do not differ enough between metachromatic leukodystrophy patients and healthy individuals to serve as a diagnostic marker. To solve this problem, Gelb's team developed a method that optimizes the extraction of sulfatides from dried blood samples and improves the signal-to-noise ratio for sulfatide detection using MS/MS and another lab technique known as ultra high performance liquid chromatography. They then tested this method by analyzing 19 sulfatide species in dried blood samples from 14 metachromatic leukodystrophy patients and 50 unaffected newborns. Their method successfully detected sulfatide concentrations in patients that were either 3.3-fold or 9.5-fold higher than in healthy infants. They also discovered that sulfatide concentration in dried blood seems to correlate with disease severity. Patients with lower sulfatide concentrations developed a milder form of metachromatic leukodystrophy, with symptoms appearing when they were 8 22 years old. The group with higher concentrations, particularly of the sulfatide species C18:0, developed an aggressive form of the disease with symptom onset at 11 26 months. ""The difference in sulfatide concentration was sufficient to unambiguously detect metachromatic leukodystrophy patients and stratify them based on severity,"" Gelb concluded. ""This suggests the feasibility of using the mass spectrometry method for newborn screening of metachromatic leukodystrophy and sets the stage for a larger-scale newborn screening pilot study. The interest in screening for metachromatic leukodystrophy seems to be timely, due to the new treatment options that are being investigated in the clinic.""","Published: January 5, 2016"

MyD88 interacts with receptors known as Toll-like receptors that detect invading pathogens, but until now it has remained unknown how MYD88-mediated signaling was controlled.  Here we found for the first time that a protein called CYLD plays a critical role in controlling the pathogen-induced inflammatory response by targeting MyD88,  said Dr. Jian-Dong Li, director of the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State and a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Inflammation and Immunity.  More specifically, we found CYLD inhibits bacteria-induced signaling of MyD88 by deactivating MyD88 at a critical amino acid, lysine 231.  CYLD acts as a  brake pedal  during the body s inflammatory response to pathogens. It turns off host defense response and prevents overactive inflammation, Li said. While appropriate inflammatory response is critical for combatting microbial pathogens, excessive or uncontrolled inflammatory response leads to detrimental tissue damage and a variety of diseases such as septic shock, asthma, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ear infections. Thus, it is important to closely regulate inflammation. This study is significant because there is an urgent need to develop novel anti-inflammatory agents to combat inflammation, and these findings could offer an alternative. Steroids have been effective at suppressing inflammation, but if used for long-term treatment they can cause serious side effects, such as increased risk of infections, liver damage, increased blood pressure and slower wound healing. Scientists have only recently begun to understand the complexities of the body s immune response to microbial pathogens. In 2011, two scientists were awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for identifying receptor proteins, named Toll-like receptors, that recognize these microorganisms and activate innate immunity, the body s first line of defense. Soon after this discovery, scientists found MyD88, known as a critical adaptor or bottleneck protein to transduce Toll-like receptor signaling. In this study, the researchers used nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), a bacterium that is the leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ear infections, to induce inflammatory response in mice and human epithelial cells. Their results demonstrate for the first time that NTHi induces lysine 63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination, a process that is critical for MyD88 to transduce Toll-like receptor signaling, of MyD88 in human epithelial cells and the mice. The study also found for the first time that CYLD directly interacts with and deubiquitinates or deactivates bacteria-induced K63-linked polyubiquitination of MyD88 at lysine 231 in mice and human epithelial cells. When pathogens invade the body, this triggers the cell signaling pathway, and small proteins called ubiquitin proteins are added to MyD88 to activate it. To deactivate MyD88, ubiquitin proteins need to be removed, an inactivation process called deubiquitination.  MyD88 has been shown to mediate the host defense response against many microbial pathogens,  Li said.  Therefore, understanding how the signaling of this protein is tightly regulated likely could lead to the development of novel therapeutics for many diseases. Because we know this is a key therapeutic target, we can develop therapeutics specifically against this target in the future for instance, treatments that increase the production of the brake-pedal protein CYLD.

Different types of polio vaccines currently exist, but none are optimal from a safety point of view. Live attenuated (weakened) vaccine strains carry genetic mutations that prevent them from causing disease, but they can--in rare cases--revert to more dangerous (or virulent) virus. There are also examples in which live attenuated virus can survive in the gut of immune-compromised individuals and can be shed into the environment through their feces. Inactivated vaccines are themselves safe, but their production at present involves growing large amounts of wild-type (i.e., active virulent) virus that is then killed with a chemical called formalin. After eradication, WHO plans to stop the use of live-attenuated polio vaccines. In addition, to improve safety, WHO has strongly encouraged new manufacturers to switch the source of inactivated virus from virulent wild-type strains to an attenuated strain, named after the polio vaccine pioneer Sabin. Arguing that the attenuated Sabin strain is unstable and therefore potentially problematic, Philip Minor, from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in Potters Bar, UK, and colleagues present data on alternative attenuated strains which they propose as a safer alternative source for inactivated vaccine. The researchers started with a Sabin vaccine strain whose attenuation and reversion has been extensively studied and is well understood. Based on this knowledge, they modified a particular region of the viral RNA in ways that they predicted would make the resulting strains genetically stable (i.e. they would not revert to wild-type or other virulent forms). They then compared these new strains with both the original Sabin vaccine strain and the wild-type strain currently used in the production of inactivated vaccine. Besides testing the genetic stability of the new strains, the researchers examined their ability to grow in tissue culture (necessary for vaccine production), their risk for causing paralysis in mice engineered to carry a human polio-virus receptor, and whether--after inactivation--they effectively immunized rats. Finally it was shown that these new strains were unable to infect primates by mouth. In all these tests, the new strains behaved as predicted, that is, they are effective, suitable to mass production, and safer than the alternatives. ""We have developed new strains for IPV production with negligible risk to the human population should they escape"", the researchers conclude, and add that the attributes of the new strains ""allow for safe vaccine production in the post-eradication world."" To address whether the use of new vaccine strains is compatible with WHO's stated post-polio eradication strategy, the researchers state that the current WHO action plan ""leaves open the option of assessing new derivatives by an expert panel that will compare the novel strains to the Sabin strains with respect to degree and stability of attenuation, potential for person to person transmission and neurovirulence in animal models to define the containment required which is not specified"". The researchers would like their strains assessed in this way. At the very least, they say, this will establish a system for assessment, which they think is necessary.","Published: January 5, 2016"

World leaders and climate scientists use carbon storage estimates to devise carbon trading and mitigation agreements, such as those at the center of the recent 21st United Nations climate change talks in Paris. Deforestation is a huge source of excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and leaders recognize forest conservation and restoration as a critical tool for reducing and mitigating climate change. The new findings apply to forests where people have cleared trees   usually for roads, timber or agriculture. The more intensely humans use a forest, the more fragmented it becomes. This fragmentation creates more dry, exposed forest edges, which are less able to store carbon. ""This is the first predictive study of how exactly carbon storage changes with distance from forest edge,"" said lead author Becky Chaplin-Kramer, a researcher at The Natural Capital Project based at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. ""Such predictions can be used to inform how to manage these systems, and refocus priorities toward maintaining larger patches of forest."" Forest clearing accounts for an estimated 12 to 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions through the annual loss of nearly 77,000 square miles of forest (an area about the size of Nebraska), a third of which is in the tropics. These emissions are calculated through forest carbon inventories, which do not take into account the decrease in carbon stocks occurring in forests where they meet with converted land. If current carbon stock estimates for tropical forests are low, then mitigation plans designed to offset timber cutting will need to be adjusted to achieve climate stabilization goals. ""It turns out that when you account for lower carbon stored in the forest edges, the global total in tropical forests is about 10 percent lower than current estimates,"" said co-author Paul West of the University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment. ""Our results highlight the impact of breaking up large blocks of forests into smaller chunks. Targeting forest conservation and restoration efforts to fill in the gaps is a win-win for both the climate and natural habitat."" The authors used insights gained from local studies, and coupled remotely sensed biomass data with land cover data, showing that edge effects vary considerably across forests. Wetter, tropical forests are more affected than drier counterparts. This research stems from an earlier collaboration that found a similar edge effect looking only at forests in Brazil. The authors then expanded their analysis to tropical forests throughout the world.","Published: January 5, 2016"

Barber, Ph.D., Leader of the Viral Oncology Program at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, may play an important role in alerting the immune system to cellular transformation. In 2008, Barber, who is also Professor and Chairman of Cell Biology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, and colleagues published in Nature the discovery of STINGas a new cellular molecule that recognizes virus and bacteria infection to initiate host defense and immune responses. In the new study they describe STING s role in the potential suppression of colorectal cancer.  Since 2008 we ve known that STING is crucial for antiviral and antibacterial responses,  said Barber.  But until now, little had been known about its function in human tumors. In this study we show, for the first time, that STING signaling is repressed in colorectal carcinoma and other cancers, an event which may enable transformed cells to evade the immune system.  Colorectal cancer currently affects around 1.2 million people in the United States and 150.000 new cases are diagnosed every year, making it the third most common cancer in both men and women. Since most colon cancers develop from benign polyps, they can be treated successfully when detected early. However, if the tumor has already spread, survival rates are generally low. Using disease models of colorectal cancer, the team of Sylvester scientists showed that loss of STING signaling negatively affected the body s ability to recognize DNA-damaged cells. In particular, certain cytokines   small proteins important for cell signaling   that facilitate tissue repair and anti-tumor priming of the immune system were not sufficiently produced to initiate a significant immune response to eradicate the colorectal cancer.  We were able to show that impaired STING responses may enable damaged cells to elude the immune system,  added Barber.  And if the body doesn t recognize and attack cancer cells, they will multiply and, ultimately, spread to other parts of the body.  Barber and his colleagues suggest evaluating STING signaling as a prognostic marker for the treatment of colorectal as well as other cancers. For example, Barber s study showed that cancer cells with defective STING signaling were particularly prone to attack by oncolytic viruses presently being used as cancer therapies. Alternate studies with colleagues have also shown that activators of STING signaling are potent stimulators of anti-tumor immune responses. Collectively, the control of STING signaling may have important implications for cancer development as well as cancer treatment.","Published: January 5, 2016"

A flu virus infection is not a homogeneous mix of viruses, but, rather, a mix of strains that gets transmitted as a swarm in the population,  explains Elodie Ghedin, a professor in New York University s Department of Biology and College of Global Public Health.  Current vaccines target the dominant strains, because they are the ones that seem to infect the largest number of individuals. But our findings reveal an ability of minor strains to elude these vaccines and spread the virus in ways not previously known.  The other co-authors of the paper included: Leo Poon, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong; Tim Song, a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine at the time of the study and now a computational biologist at NYU; and researchers at the J. Craig Venter Institute, the University of Sydney, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai. It s long been known that the Influenza A virus is marked by a high level of genetic diversity. However, our knowledge largely stems from the dominant strain, which vaccines aim to combat. Less understood is the diversity of the minor strains and how it passes between individuals thus revealing these strains  ability to spread the virus. The scientists aimed to determine how many viral particles are transmitted when afflicted with the flu as well as the number of them able to replicate when they transmit. To examine this phenomenon, Ghedin, part of NYU s Center for Genomics & Systems Biology, and her colleagues performed whole genome deep sequencing of upper nasal cavity swabs taken from confirmed 2009 Hong Kong flu cases and from their household contacts. Using sophisticated sequencing methods, the team could not only identify variants in flu strains, but also quantify what was being transmitted between infected individuals. Their results showed that, as expected, most carried the dominant virus H1N1 or H3N2. But, in addition, all carried minor strains and variants of the major and minor strains. What was surprising was how readily these variants were transmitted across the studied individuals.  The combination of unique data, sequencing approaches and mathematical methods create a nuanced picture of the transmission of diversity during a pandemic,  notes study co-author Benjamin Greenbaum, an assistant professor at the Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.  We were able to look at the variants and could link individuals based on these variants,  adds Ghedin.  What stood out was also how these mixes of major and minor strains were being transmitted across the population during the 2009 pandemic to the point where minor strains became dominant.

The investigators analyzed genetic information from more than 4,000 cancer cases included in The Cancer Genome Atlas project, an initiative funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to unravel the genetic basis of cancer.  In general, we have known that ovarian and breast cancers have a significant inherited component, and others, such as acute myeloid leukemia and lung cancer, have a much smaller inherited genetic contribution,  said senior author Li Ding, PhD, associate professor of medicine and assistant director of the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University.  But this is the first time on a large scale that we ve been able to pinpoint gene culprits or even the actual mutations responsible for cancer susceptibility.  The new information has implications for improving the accuracy of existing genetic tests for cancer risk and eventually expanding the available tests to include a wider variety of tumors. Past genomic studies of cancer compared sequencing data from patients  healthy tissue and the same patients  tumors. These studies uncovered mutations present in the tumors, helping researchers identify important genes that likely play roles in cancer. But this type of analysis can t distinguish between inherited mutations present at birth and mutations acquired over the lifespan. To help tease out cancer s inherited components, the new study adds analysis of the sequencing data from the patients  normal cells that contain the  germline  information. A patient s germline is the genetic information inherited from both parents. This new layer of information gives a genetic baseline of a patient s genes at birth and can reveal whether cancer-associated mutations were already present. In all the cancer cases they analyzed, the investigators looked for rare germline mutations in genes known to be associated with cancer. If one copy of one of these genes from one parent is already mutated at birth, the second normal copy from the other parent often can compensate for the defect. But individuals with such mutations are more susceptible to a so-called  second hit.  As they age, they are at higher risk of developing mutations in the remaining normal copy of the gene.  We looked for germline mutations in the tumor,  Ding said.  But it was not enough for the mutations simply to be present; they needed to be enriched in the tumor   present at higher frequency. If a mutation is present in the germline and amplified in the tumor, there is a high likelihood it is playing a role in the cancer.  In 114 genes known to be associated with cancer, they found rare germline mutations in all 12 cancer types, but in varying frequencies depending on the type. They focused on a type of mutation called a truncation because most truncated genes can t function at all. Of the ovarian cancer cases the investigators studied, 19 percent of them carried rare germline truncations. In contrast, only 4 percent of the acute myeloid leukemia cases in the analysis carried these truncations in the germline. They also found that 11 percent of the stomach cancer cases included such germline truncations, which was a surprise, according to the researchers, because that number is on par with the percentage for breast cancer.  We also found a significant number of germline truncations in the BRCA1and BRCA2 genes present in tumor types other than breast cancer, including stomach and prostate cancers, for example,  Ding said.  This suggests we should pay attention to the potential involvement of these two genes in other cancer types.  The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are important for DNA repair. While they are primarily associated with risk of breast cancer, this analysis supports the growing body of evidence that they have a broader impact.  Of the patients with BRCA1 truncations in the germline, 90 percent have this BRCA1 truncation enriched in the tumor, regardless of cancer type,  Ding said. Genetic testing of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in women at risk of breast cancer can reveal extremely useful information for prevention. When, for example, the genes are shown to be normal, there is no elevated genetic risk of breast cancer. But if either of these genes is mutated in ways that are known to disable either gene, breast cancer risk is dramatically increased. In this situation, doctors and genetic counselors can help women navigate the options available for reducing that risk. But mutations come in a number of varieties. Genetic testing also can reveal many that have unknown consequences for the function of these genes, so their influence on cancer risk can t be predicted. To help clarify this gray area in clinical practice, Ding and her colleagues Jeffrey Parvin, MD, PhD, professor and director of the division of computational biology and bioinformatics at The Ohio State University, and Feng Chen, PhD, associate professor of medicine at Washington University, investigated 68 germline non-truncation mutations of unknown significance in the BRCA1 gene. For each mutation, they tested how well the BRCA1 protein could perform one of its key DNA-repair functions. The researchers found that six of the mutations behaved like truncations, disabling the gene completely. These mutations also were enriched in the tumors, supporting a likely role in cancer.  It is important to be able to show that these six mutations of unknown clinical significance are, in fact, loss-of-function mutations,  Ding said.  But I also want to emphasize the contrasting point. Many more show normal function, at least according to our analysis. Many of these types of mutations are neutral, and we would like to identify them so that health-care providers can better counsel their patients.  Ding said more research is needed to confirm these results before they can be used to advise patients making health-care decisions.  Our strategy of investigating germline-tumor interactions provides a good way to prioritize important mutations that we should focus on,  she said.  For the information to eventually be used in the clinic, we will need to perform this type of analysis on even larger numbers of patients. ","Published: January 5, 2016"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/stem-cell-memory-210163,Stem Cell Memory Scientists find molecular key that prevents the conversion of adult cells into iPS cells  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. They say we can't escape our past no matter how much we change, we still have the memory of what came before.  The same can be said of our cells. Adult cells, such as skin or blood cells, have a cellular  memory,  or record of how the cell changes as it develops from an uncommitted embryonic cell into a specialized adult cell. Now, Harvard Medical School researchers at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and at Massachusetts General Hospital, in collaboration with scientists from the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology (IMBA) and the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) in Vienna, have identified genes that when suppressed effectively erase a cell's memory, making the cell more susceptible to reprogramming and, consequently, making the process of reprogramming quicker and more efficient.  We began this work because we wanted to know why a skin cell is a skin cell, and why does it not change its identity the next day, or the next month, or a year later?  said co-senior authorKonrad Hochedlinger, professor of stem cell and regenerative biology at HMS, HMS professor of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital and a principal faculty member at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. Every cell in the human body has the same genome, or DNA blueprint, and it is how those genes are turned on and off during development that determines what kind of adult cell each will become. By manipulating those genes and introducing new factors, scientists can unlock dormant parts of an adult cell's genome and reprogram it into another cell type. However,  a skin cell knows it is a skin cell,  said IMBA's Josef Penninger, even after scientists reprogram those skin cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), a process that would ideally require a cell to  forget  its identity before assuming a new one. Cellular memory is often conserved, acting as a roadblock to reprogramming.  We wanted to find out which factors stabilize this memory and what mechanism prevents iPS cells from forming,  Penninger said. To identify potential factors, the team established a genetic library targeting known chromatin regulators genes that control the packaging and bookmarking of DNA and are involved in creating cellular memory. Hochedlinger and Sihem Cheloufi, co-first author and a research fellow in genetics in Hochedlinger's lab, designed a screening approach that tested each of those factors. Of the 615 factors screened, the researchers identified four chromatin regulators, three of which had not yet been described, as potential roadblocks to reprogramming. In comparison to the three- to four-fold increase seen by suppressing previously known roadblock factors, inhibiting the newly described CAF1 (chromatin assembly factor 1) made the process 50- to 200-fold more efficient. Moreover, in the absence of CAF1, reprogramming turned out to be much faster: While the process normally takes nine days, the researchers could detect the first iPS cell after four days.  The CAF1 complex ensures that during DNA replication and cell division, the daughter cells keep their memory, which is encoded on the histones that the DNA is wrapped around,"" said Ulrich Elling, a co-first author from IMBA. ""When we block CAF-1, daughter cells fail to wrap their DNA the same way, lose this information and convert into blank sheets of paper. In this state, they respond more sensitively to signals from the outside, meaning we can manipulate them much more easily.  By suppressing CAF-1, the researchers were also able to facilitate the conversion of one type of adult cell directly into another, skipping the intermediary step of forming iPS cells, via a process called direct reprogramming, or transdifferentiation. Thus, CAF-1 appears to act as a general guardian of cell identity whose depletion facilitates both the interconversion of one adult cell type to another as well as the conversion of specialized cells into iPS cells. In finding CAF-1, the researchers identified a complex that allows cell memory to be erased and rewritten.  The cells forget who they are, making it easier to trick them into becoming another type of cell,  said Cheloufi. CAF-1 may provide a general key to facilitate the reprogramming of cells to model disease and test therapeutic agents, IMP's Johannes Zuber explained.  The best-case scenario,  he said,  is that with this insight, we hold a universal key in our hands that will allow us to model cells at will. ","Published: January 5, 2016"

Patients with type 1 diabetes have their insulin secreting cells destroyed by the immune system and require daily insulin injections. Pancreatic islet transplantation is an effective treatment that can dramatically reduce daily doses or even eliminate dependence on external insulin. Insulin producing cells are injected into a recipient liver. After an adaptation period they start to produce sufficient hormone needed by diabetic patients. However, while the transplantation procedure itself has been greatly improved in recent years, collection, preservation, and transportation of these cells are still very challenging. Research published in Advanced Healthcare Materials by the scientists from the Okinawa Institute of Technology and Science Graduate University (OIST) in collaboration with the University of Washington and Wuhan University of Technology offers a solution for some of these problems.Production and secretion of insulin occur in the pancreas -- an endocrine gland in the digestive system. Cells secreting insulin are clustered in pancreatic islets. Despite their crucial role in organismal wellbeing these islets comprise only a few percent of the pancreatic tissue. The islet transplantation does not require major surgical intervention and is often done under local anaesthesia. It is also cheaper and might be safer than transplantation of the entire pancreas. Unfortunately, so far, only human islets can be transplanted and their supply is but a trickle. Cryopreservation, or deep freezing, is the method commonly used for the islet preservation and transportation. But it is not completely safe. One might think that storage at temperatures below -190 C is the most dangerous phase. However, the cells are very good at enduring it. It is the freezing process (-15 to -60 C) itself that poses the most challenges. As the cells are cooled, water in and around them freezes. Ice crystals have sharp edges that can pierce membranes and compromise cell viability. This also becomes problematic during thawing. A multidisciplinary group of researchers led by Prof. Amy Shen, head of the Micro/Bio/Nanofluidics Unit at OIST, developed a novel cryopreservation method that not only helps to protect pancreatic islets from ice damage, but also facilitates real-time assessments of cell viability. Moreover, this method may reduce transplant rejection and, in turn, decrease use of immunosuppressant drugs, which can be harmful to patient health. The novel technique employs a droplet microfluidic device to encapsulate pancreatic islets in hydrogel made of alginate, a natural polymer extracted from seaweed. These capsules have a unique microstructure: a porous network and considerable amount of non-freezable water. There are three types of water in the hydrogel: free water, freezable bound water, and non-freezable bound water. Free water is regular water: it freezes at 0 C, producing ice crystals. Freezable bound water also crystallises, but the freezing point is lower. Non-freezable bound water does not form ice due to the strong association between water molecules and the hydrogel networks. Hydrogel capsules with large amounts of non-freezable bound water protect the cells from the ice damage and reduce the need for cryoprotectants -- special substances that minimise or prevent freezing damage and can be toxic in high concentrations. Another innovation, proposed by the group, is the use of a fluorescent oxygen-sensitive dye in hydrogel capsules. The porous structure of the capsules does not impede oxygen flow to the cells. And this dye functions as a real-time single-islet oxygen sensor. Fluorescence indicates whether cells are consuming oxygen and, therefore, are alive and healthy. It is a simple, time-efficient, and cheap method of assessing viability, both of individual islets or populations thereof. Islet encapsulation reduces the risk of rejection of transplanted cells by the recipient. The hydrogel capsule allows small molecules, e.g. nutrients and islet secretions, to pass through the membrane easily, but prevents direct contact between implanted islets and host cells. Encapsulation also may prevent an attack on transplants by the autoimmune response that destroyed the patient's own islets in the first place. The microencapsulation method can help to overcome some major challenges in pancreatic islet transplantation, including the scarcity of available islets and the lack of simple and reliable control methods, especially for individual islet assessment. It offers hope to patients suffering from type 1 diabetes to return to a 'normal' life, free of insulin injections.","Published: January 5, 2016"

Measuring the growth factor HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2) is an important tool for deciding correct treatment in breast cancer. Treatments targeting HER2 are expensive but save the lives of many women. Targeted treatments have no effect if the metastases do not express HER2. The current diagnosis of elevated HER2 expression in metastatic cancer is based on examination of tissue samples obtained by surgery or needle biopsies from the liver, bones and other organs. The aim of the current study was to develop a simpler and non-invasive technique, based on whole-body PET/CT imaging, and compare the results of image analysis to the invasive measurements in the same patients. The study included 16 women with on-going treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Twelve had been diagnosed with a HER2-positive primary tumor and four were HER2-negative. All patients were scanned using combined PET/CT and a novel tracer molecule, ABY-025 Affibody, labeled with the short-lived radioactive isotope gallium-68. The results showed that the amount of HER2-expression in the metastases was accurately measured with the new method. In addition, the amount of HER2-expression in the metastases was frequently found to be different from the primary tumor, leading to a change in therapy in several patients. The new method might substitute invasive tissue sampling in the near future. Our study resulted in two patients starting therapy and one patient ending therapy with HER2-targeting drugs says Jens S rensen, PET-reseacher and adjunct professor at the Institution of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University. The research group now plans a larger study with more participating hospitals to confirm the results with the intention of making the new method more widely available to patients.","Published: January 5, 2016"

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/geneediting-halts-dmd-progression-195441,Gene Editing Halts DMD Progression Using a new gene editing technique  a team of scientists from UT Southwestern Medical Center stopped progression of Duchenne muscular dystrophy  DMD  in young mice  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. If efficiently and safely scaled up in DMD patients, this technique could lead to one of the first successful genome editing-based treatments for this fatal disease, researchers said. DMD, the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy among boys, is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. It is caused by mutations in the X-linked DMD gene that encodes the protein dystrophin. The disease affects one in 3,500 to 5,000 boys, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other estimates, and often leads to premature death by the early 30s. Although the genetic cause of DMD has been known for nearly 30 years, no effective treatments exist. The disease breaks down muscle fibers and replaces them with fibrous or fatty tissue, causing the muscle to gradually weaken. This condition often results in heart muscle disease, or cardiomyopathy, the leading cause of death in these patients. In the study, UTSW researchers used a gene-editing approach to permanently correct the DMD mutation that causes the disease in young mice.  This is different from other therapeutic approaches, because it eliminates the cause of the disease,  said senior author Dr. Eric Olson, Chairman of Molecular Biology, and Co-Director of the Senator Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Center at UT Southwestern. In 2014, Dr. Olson s team first used this technique   called CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing   to correct the mutation in the germ line of mice and prevent muscular dystrophy. This paved the way for novel genome editing-based therapeutics in DMD. It also raised several challenges for clinical applications of gene editing. Since germ line editing is not feasible in humans, strategies would need to be developed to deliver gene-editing components to postnatal tissues. To test this out, researchers delivered gene-editing components to the mice via adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9). DMD mice treated with this technique produced dystrophin protein and progressively showed improved structure and function of skeletal muscle and heart.  AAV9 can efficiently infect humans in a tissue-specific manner, but it does not cause human disease or toxicity. It s a molecular missile for gene therapy,  said Dr. Leonela Amoasii, a postdoctoral researcher in the Olson lab and co-lead author of the study with Dr. Chengzu Long, Instructor of Molecular Biology.  The CRISPR/Cas9 system is an adaptive immune system of single-celled organisms against invading virus. Ironically, this system was hijacked, we packaged it into a nonpathogenic virus, and corrected a genetic mutation in an animal model,  added Dr. Long. The CRISPR genome-editing technology, which was developed by a researcher at University of California at Berkeley, was picked as the  Breakthrough of the Year  scientific development by Science.  This study represents a very important translational application of genome editing of DMD mutations in young mice. It s a solid step toward a practical cure for DMD,  said Dr. Rhonda Bassel-Duby, Professor of Molecular Biology and Co-Principal Investigator of a genomic editing project with Dr. Olson at the Wellstone Center.  Importantly, in principle, the same strategy can be applied to numerous types of mutations within the human DMD patients,  added Dr. Olson, who also serves as Director of the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine, and holds the Annie and Willie Nelson Professorship in Stem Cell Research, the Pogue Distinguished Chair in Research on Cardiac Birth Defects, and the Robert A. Welch Distinguished Chair in Science. Now, the research team is working to apply this gene-editing technique to cells from DMD patients and in larger preclinical animal models. This marks the first major finding of the UTSW Wellstone Center, which was recently established with $7.8 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health. UTSW is one of six Wellstone Centers across the country, which work to translate scientific findings and technological developments into novel treatments for muscular dystrophy, and to promote basic, translational, and clinical research. UT Southwestern s Wellstone Center focuses on Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  The recent groundbreaking discoveries from the Olson laboratory using genome editing to correct the genetic mutation that causes DMD have accelerated the race to find a cure for this deadly disease,  said Dr. Pradeep Mammen, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine and Co-Director of the UTSW Wellstone Center.

If efficiently and safely scaled up in DMD patients, this technique could lead to one of the first successful genome editing-based treatments for this fatal disease, the researchers say. DMD, the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy among boys, is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. It is caused by mutations in the X-linked DMD gene that encodes the protein dystrophin. The disease affects one in 3,500 to 5,000 boys, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) and other estimates, and often leads to premature death by the early 30s. Although the genetic cause of DMD has been known for nearly 30 years, no effective treatments exist. The disease breaks down muscle fibers and replaces them with fibrous or fatty tissue, causing the muscle to gradually weaken. This condition often results in heart muscle disease, or cardiomyopathy, the leading cause of death in these patients. Members of the UT Southwestern team (L-R): Dr. Chengzu Long, Dr. Eric Olson, Dr. Rhonda Bassel-Duby, Dr. Leonela Amoasii, John Shelton, and Alex Mireault. Credit: UT Southwestern  In the study published in Science, UTSW researchers used a gene-editing approach to permanently correct the DMD mutation that causes the disease in young mice.  This is different from other therapeutic approaches, because it eliminates the cause of the disease,  said senior author Dr. Eric Olson, Chairman of Molecular Biology, and Co-Director of the Senator Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Center at UT Southwestern. In 2014, Dr. Olson s team first used this technique called CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to correct the mutation in the germ line of mice and prevent muscular dystrophy. This paved the way for novel genome editing-based therapeutics in DMD. It also raised several challenges for clinical applications of gene editing. Since germ line editing is not feasible in humans, strategies would need to be developed to deliver gene-editing components to postnatal tissues. To test this out, researchers delivered gene-editing components to the mice via adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9). DMD mice treated with this technique produced dystrophin protein and progressively showed improved structure and function of skeletal muscle and heart.  AAV9 can efficiently infect humans in a tissue-specific manner, but it does not cause human disease or toxicity. It s a molecular missile for gene therapy,  said Dr. Leonela Amoasii, a postdoctoral researcher in the Olson lab and co-lead author of the study with Dr. Chengzu Long, Instructor of Molecular Biology.  The CRISPR/Cas9 system is an adaptive immune system of single-celled organisms against invading virus. Ironically, this system was hijacked, we packaged it into a nonpathogenic virus, and corrected a genetic mutation in an animal model,  added Dr. Long. The CRISPR genome-editing technology, which was developed by a researcher at University of California at Berkeley, was picked as the  Breakthrough of the Year  scientific development by Science.  This study represents a very important translational application of genome editing of DMD mutations in young mice. It s a solid step toward a practical cure for DMD,  said Dr. Rhonda Bassel-Duby, Professor of Molecular Biology and Co-Principal Investigator of a genomic editing project with Dr. Olson at the Wellstone Center.  Importantly, in principle, the same strategy can be applied to numerous types of mutations within the human DMD patients,  added Dr. Olson, who also serves as Director of the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine, and holds the Annie and Willie Nelson Professorship in Stem Cell Research, the Pogue Distinguished Chair in Research on Cardiac Birth Defects, and the Robert A. Welch Distinguished Chair in Science. Now, the research team is working to apply this gene-editing technique to cells from DMD patients and in larger preclinical animal models. This marks the first major finding of the UTSW Wellstone Center, which was recently established with $7.8 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health. UTSW is one of six Wellstone Centers across the country, which work to translate scientific findings and technological developments into novel treatments for muscular dystrophy, and to promote basic, translational, and clinical research. UT Southwestern s Wellstone Center focuses on Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  The recent groundbreaking discoveries from the Olson laboratory using genome editing to correct the genetic mutation that causes DMD have accelerated the race to find a cure for this deadly disease,  said Dr. Pradeep Mammen, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine and Co-Director of the UTSW Wellstone Center.  The challenge now lies before Wellstone Center researchers to translate these discoveries in the mouse model of DMD into a therapy for patients with DMD.

These results are exciting, as vitamin D has the potential to be an inexpensive, safe and convenient treatment for people with MS,  says study author Peter Calabresi, MD, director of the Johns Hopkins Multiple Sclerosis Center and professor neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  More research is needed to confirm these findings with larger groups of people and to help us understand the mechanisms for these effects, but the results are promising.  Low levels of vitamin D in the blood are tied to an increased risk of developing MS. People who have MS and low levels of vitamin D are more likely to have greater disability and more disease activity. For the study, 40 people with relapsing-remitting MS received either 10,400 international units (IU) or 800 IU of vitamin D3 supplements per day for six months. Patients with severe vitamin D deficiency were not included in the study. The current recommended daily allowance of vitamin D3 is 600 IU. Blood tests at the start of the study and again at three and six months measured the amount of vitamin D in the blood and the response in the immune system s T cells, which play a key role in MS. See Also: Pathological progression of multiple sclerosis documented for the first time While researchers are still determining the optimal level of vitamin D in the blood for people with MS, a suggested range of 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) has been proposed as a target. Participants taking the high dose of vitamin D reached levels within the proposed target, whereas the group taking the low dose did not reach the target. Side effects from the vitamin supplements were minor and were not different between the people taking the high dose and the people taking the low dose. One person in each group relapsed. The people taking the high dose had a reduction in the percentage of inflammatory T cells related to MS severity, specifically IL-17+CD4+ and CD161+CD4+ cells. When the increase in vitamin D levels in the blood over base line levels was greater than 18 ng/ml, every additional 5 ng/ml increase in vitamin D led to a 1 percent decrease in the percentage of IL-17+CD4+ T cells in the blood. The people taking the low dose did not have any noticeable changes in the percentages of their T cell subsets.  We hope that these changes in inflammatory T cell responses translate to a reduced severity of disease,  says Calabresi.  Other clinical trials are underway to determine if that is the case.

At that time, the American researcher Benjamin Libet studied the nature of cerebral processes of study participants during conscious decision-making. He demonstrated that conscious decisions were initiated by unconscious brain processes, and that a wave of brain activity referred to as a 'readiness potential' could be recorded even before the subject had made a conscious decision. How can the unconscious brain processes possibly know in advance what decision a person is going to make at a time when they are not yet sure themselves? Until now, the existence of such preparatory brain processes has been regarded as evidence of 'determinism', according to which free will is nothing but an illusion, meaning our decisions are initiated by unconscious brain processes, and not by our 'conscious self'. In conjunction with Prof. Dr. Benjamin Blankertz and Matthias Schultze-Kraft from Technische Universit t Berlin, a team of researchers from Charit 's Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, led by Prof. Dr. John-Dylan Haynes, has now taken a fresh look at this issue. Using state-of-the-art measurement techniques, the researchers tested whether people are able to stop planned movements once the readiness potential for a movement has been triggered. ""The aim of our research was to find out whether the presence of early brain waves means that further decision-making is automatic and not under conscious control, or whether the person can still cancel the decision, i.e. use a 'veto',"" explains Prof. Haynes. As part of this study, researchers asked study participants to enter into a 'duel' with a computer, and then monitored their brain waves throughout the duration of the game using electroencephalography (EEG). A specially-trained computer was then tasked with using these EEG data to predict when a subject would move, the aim being to out-maneuver the player. This was achieved by manipulating the game in favor of the computer as soon as brain wave measurements indicated that the player was about to move. If subjects are able to evade being predicted based on their own brain processes this would be evidence that control over their actions can be retained for much longer than previously thought, which is exactly what the researchers were able to demonstrate. ""A person's decisions are not at the mercy of unconscious and early brain waves. They are able to actively intervene in the decision-making process and interrupt a movement,"" says Prof. Haynes. ""Previously people have used the preparatory brain signals to argue against free will. Our study now shows that the freedom is much less limited than previously thought. However, there is a 'point of no return' in the decision-making process, after which cancellation of movement is no longer possible."" Further studies are planned in which the researchers will investigate more complex decision-making processes. Charit  - Universit tsmedizin Berlin  press release Schultze-Kraft M et al.

The scientists from the Max Planck Institute of Developmental Biology have now discovered a new nematode species on the island. The discovered nematodes live inside of fig plants and at first sight they look totally different. Much to their surprise, the scientists found that all the worms belong to a single species, which can develop five different mouth forms. The nematodes are genetically identical, however their food source decides on the mouth form. They are an extreme example of evolutionary divergence within a species. The discovered roundworms, so-called nematodes, live inside of wild figs and hitch hike on tiny pollinating fig wasps to reach new fig flowers. Ralf Sommer s team called the new species Pristionchus borbonicus after the  le Bourbon, the old name of R union Island until 1848. Much to their surprise, the scientists found that the tiny worms had five distinct mouth forms, differing so much from each other in their appearance that they were initially considered to belong to separate species. Conventional morphology, that is the study of the form and structure of organisms, examines organisms under the microscope and describes them as accurately as possible. Only by sequencing the nematodes  genomes, the Max Planck scientists managed to assign the five distinct mouth forms to a single species, namely the recently describedPristionchus borbonicus. This is an extreme example of evolutionary divergence within one species and of variation in shape and form in the context of genetic identity. Interestingly, the researchers found similar roundworms of the same type in figs from Vietnam and South Africa. It is evident that the association with figs is a widespread phenomenon.  The different mouth forms of Pristionchus borbonicus, that we have found now, are specialized for the preferred intake of bacteria, yeasts or other roundworms. So, obviously they occupy different ecological niches within the fig , explains Ralf Sommer, Director of the Department for Evolutionary Biology.  With this team of specialists the species can exploit a large food spectrum and efficiently buffer fluctuations in the availability of a certain resource by changing the proportion of mouth forms.  Until now Sommer and his team knew that the Pristionchus species, with which they have already been working for a long time, live on beetles and develop two different mouth forms, depending on the food supply and on the environment. Thus, Pristionchus develops either a short wide mouth or a long narrow one. The wide-mouthed variant, which has a single, characteristic tooth, is suitable for carrying out predatory attacks. The narrow version, in contrast, is mainly used for grazing on bacterial food sources. Thus, the tiny fig fruit has once again proven its reputation as a highly complex, co-evolved ecosystem with the fig wasp as the transmitter that reliably colonizes each generation of figs with a large number of different bacteria, yeasts, other microbes and roundworms. To understand the role that Pristionchus borbonicus plays in this intricate system is an exciting new subject of research for the MPI scientists. They already plan their next journey to R union to find new types of figs and nematodes.","Published: January 4, 2016"

Consumption of mercury-contaminated seafood leads to increased risk for cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairments. In the past several years, a global treaty and a domestic policy have been put in place to curb mercury emissions. But how will such policies directly benefit the U.S.?  In a new study MIT researchers report that global action on reducing mercury emissions will lead to twice the economic benefits for the U.S., compared with domestic action, by 2050. However, those in the U.S. who consume locally caught freshwater fish, rather than seafood from the global market, will benefit more from domestic rather than international mercury regulations. The researchers calculated the projected U.S. economic benefits from the Minamata Convention on Mercury, a global treaty adopted in 2013 to reduce mercury emissions worldwide, compared with the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), a national regulation set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to reduce mercury pollution from the country s coal-fired power plants. Overall, while both policies are projected to lead to roughly the same amount of reductions in mercury deposited on U.S. soil compared to a no-policy case, Americans  consumption of mercury by 2050 are estimated to be 91 percent lower under the global treaty, compared to 32 percent under U.S. policy alone. The researchers say these numbers reflect the U.S. commercial fish market, 90 percent of which is sourced from Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins   regions that are heavily influenced by emissions from non-U.S. sources, including China. From their projections of reduced mercury consumption, the researchers estimated health impacts to the U.S. population under both policies, then translated these impacts into economic benefits. They characterized these in two ways: projected lifetime benefits from an individual s reduced exposure to mercury, including willingness to pay for lowering the risk of a fatal heart attack, cost savings from avoided medical care, and increased earnings; and economy-wide benefits, or the associated productivity gains of a national labor force with improved IQ and fewer heart attacks, as a result of reduced exposure to mercury. Based on these calculations, the team estimated that by 2050, emissions reductions under the Minamata Convention on Mercury would lead to $339 billion in lifetime benefits and $104 billion in economy-wide benefits in the U.S., compared to $147 billion and $43 billion, respectively, from MATS. The global treaty, then, should lead to more than twice the benefits projected from the domestic policy.  Historically it s been hard to quantify benefits for global treaties,  says Noelle Selin, the Esther and Harold E. Edgerton Career Development Associate Professor in MIT s Institute for Data, Systems and Society and in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences.  Would we be able to see a U.S. benefit, given you re spreading reductions and benefits around the world? And we were.  Tracing the policy-to-impacts pathway Determining how regulatory policies will ultimately lead to health and economic benefits is a complex and convoluted problem. To trace the pathway from policy to impacts, Selin and co-author Amanda Giang, a graduate student in MIT s Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, began with estimates of mercury reductions set by both the Minamata Convention and MATS. The team then used an atmospheric transport model to trace where emissions would settle over time, based on the reductions proposed by each policy scenario. From regional depositions of mercury, they then estimated the resulting mercury concentrations in fish and mapped these concentrations to seafood sources throughout the world. Next, the team correlated seafood sources to fish consumption in the U.S., and calculated changes in human exposure to mercury through time. They used epidemiological models to estimate how changes in mercury exposure affect incidence of health impacts, such as heart attacks and IQ deficits. From there, Selin and Giang used economic valuation methods to translate heath impacts into economic benefits   namely, lifetime and economy-wide benefits to the U.S. Understanding the drivers While the researchers were able to come up with benefits in the billions for both the global and domestic policies, they acknowledge that these numbers come with a significant amount of uncertainty, which they also explored.  We re trying to understand different drivers in the variability of these numbers,  Giang says.  There s a lot of uncertainty in this system, and we want to understand what shifts these numbers up and down.  For example, scientists are unsure how far different forms of mercury will travel through the atmosphere, as well as how long it will take for mercury to accumulate in fish. In their analysis, Giang found that, even taking into account most of these uncertainties, the economic benefits from the global treaty outweighed those from the domestic policy, except when it came to one key uncertainty: where people s seafood originates.  We do find that in our scenario where everyone is eating local fish, the benefits of domestic policy are going to be larger than the Minamata convention,  Giang says.  Our study points to the importance of domestic policy in terms of protecting vulnerable populations such as subsistence fishers or other communities that do rely on U.S. freshwater fish.   There are a ton of uncertainties here, but we know that mercury is a dangerous pollutant,  Selin adds.  When you put in a policy, how do you think about its ultimate environmental and human effects? We think this method is really a way to try and move that forward. ","Published: January 4, 2016"

""We've got an increasing number of unusually risky experiments, and we need to be more thoughtful and deliberate in how we oversee this work,"" said co-author David Relman, a professor of infectious diseases and co-director of Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC). Relman said that cutting-edge bioscience and technology research has yielded tremendous benefits, such as cheap and effective ways of developing new drugs, vaccines, fuels and food. But he said he was concerned about the growing number of labs that are developing novel pathogens with pandemic potential. For instance, researchers at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in their quest to create a better model for studying human disease, recently deployed a gene editing technique known as CRISPR-Cas9 on a respiratory virus so that it was able to edit the mouse genome and cause cancer in infected mice. ""They ended up creating, in my mind, a very dangerous virus and showed others how they too could make similar kinds of dangerous viruses,"" Relman said. Scientists in the United States and the Netherlands, conducting so-called ""gain-of-function"" experiments, have also created much more contagious versions of the deadly H5N1 bird flu in the lab. Publicly available information from published experiments like these, such as genomic sequence data, could allow scientists to reverse engineer a virus that would be difficult to contain and highly harmful were it to spread. And a recent spate of high-profile accidents at U.S. government labs   including the mishandling of anthrax, bird flu, smallpox and Ebola samples   has raised the specter of a dangerous pathogen escaping from the lab and causing an outbreak or even a global pandemic. ""These kinds of accidents can have severe consequences,"" said Megan Palmer, CISAC senior research scholar and a co-author on the paper. ""But we lack adequate processes and public information to assess the significance of the benefits and risks. Unless we address this fundamental issue, then we're going to continue to be reactive and make ourselves more vulnerable to mistakes and accidents in the long term."" Centralizing leadership Leadership on risk management in biotechnology has not evolved much since the mid-1970s, when pioneering scientists gathered at the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA and established guidelines that are still in use today. Palmer said that although scientific self-governance is an essential element of oversight, left unchecked, it could lead to a ""culture of invincibility over time."" ""There's reliance on really a narrow set of technical experts to assess risks, and we need to broaden that leadership to be able to account for the new types of opportunities and challenges that emerging science and technology bring,"" she said. Relman described the current system as ""piecemeal, ad hoc and uncoordinated,"" and said that a more ""holistic"" approach that included academia, industry and all levels of government was needed to tackle the problem. ""It's time for us as a set of communities to step back and think more strategically,"" Relman said. The governance of ""dual use"" technologies, which can be used for both peaceful and offensive purposes, poses significant challenges in the life sciences, said Stanford political scientist Francis Fukuyama, who also contributed to the paper. ""Unlike nuclear weapons, it doesn't take large-scale labs,"" Fukuyama said. ""It doesn't take a lot of capacity to do dangerous research on biology."" The co-authors recommend appointing a top-ranking government official, such as a special assistant to the president, and a supporting committee, to oversee safety and security in the life sciences and associated technologies. They would coordinate the management of risk, including regulatory authorities needed to ensure accountability and information sharing. ""Although many agencies right now are tasked with worrying about safety, they have got conflicting interests that make them not ideal for being the single point of vigilance in this area,"" Fukuyama said. ""The National Institutes of Health is trying to promote research but also stop dangerous research. Sometimes those two aims run at cross-purposes."" ""It's a big step to call for a new regulator, because in general we have too much regulation, but we felt there were a lot of dangers that were not being responded to in an appropriate way,"" he said. Improving cooperation Strong cooperative international mechanisms are also needed to encourage other countries to support responsible research, Fukuyama said. ""What we want to avoid is a kind of arms race phenomenon, where countries are trying to compete with each other doing risky research in this area, and not wanting to mitigate risks because of fears that other countries are going to get ahead of them,"" he said.","Published: January 4, 2016"

The acquisition provides Agenus the ability to accelerate the development of new cancer vaccines and other single agent immuno-oncology approaches, as well as combination therapies.  PhosImmune s groundbreaking neoantigen assets significantly expand Agenus  current efforts, and present exciting near-term opportunities for new products and partnerships,  said Dr. Garo H. Armen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Agenus.  This acquisition expands our immuno-oncology pipeline and strengthens our neoantigen capabilities to enable the development of best-in-class cancer vaccines and other novel therapies.  Novel Neoantigens PhosImmune s neoantigens have unique advantages in cancer immunotherapy. The company s phosphopeptide tumor targets (PTTs) are fragments of proteins expressed in cancer cells. These fragments are phosphorylated due to signal dysregulation involved in the development of cancers and, as a result, appear as foreign to the immune system. The approach is synergistic with Agenus  AutoSynVax  vaccine program for targeting patient-specific tumor neoantigens. PTTs can expand AutoSynVax and other immunotherapeutic approaches to include patients with lower levels of mutations that may not have enough neoantigens to activate the immune system effectively. PTTs can also be shared by patients with specific cancers, providing the potential for  off-the-shelf  vaccines. PhosImmune s scientific founders, Donald Hunt, Ph.D. and Vic Engelhard, Ph.D., both of University of Virginia, and Mark Cobbold, M.D., Ph.D., of Massachusetts General Hospital, have identified a large number of proprietary, tumor-specific PTTs. These PTTs are found on a wide variety of cancer types.

The canSAR database** was launched in 2011 by researchers in the Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR)  with the ambitious goal of using Big Data approaches to build a detailed picture of how the majority of known human molecules behave. canSAR has already collated billions of experimental measurements mapping the actions of one million drugs and chemicals on human proteins, and has combined these data with genetic information and results from clinical trials. The new version of canSAR uses artificial intelligence to identify nooks and crannies on the surface of faulty cancer-causing molecules, as a key step in designing new drugs to block them. It also allows scientists to identify communication lines that can be intercepted within tumour cells, opening up potential new approaches for cancer treatment. The growing database now holds the 3D structures of almost three million cavities on the surface of nearly 110,000 molecules. Cancer Research UK and the ICR together ensure that this resource is free to use for researchers around the world, giving them speedy access to key information. Dr Bissan Al-Lazikani, team leader in computational biology at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, who led the Cancer Research UK-funded team that developed canSAR, said:  Our database is constantly growing with information and is the largest of its kind   with more than 140,000 users from over 175 countries. And we regularly develop new artificial intelligence technologies that help scientists make predictions and design experiments. Our aim is that cancer scientists will be armed with the data they need to carry out life-saving research into the most exciting drugs of the future.  Scientists need to find all the information there is about a faulty gene or protein to understand whether a new drug might work. These data are vast and scattered, but the canSAR database brings them together and adds value by identifying hidden links and presenting the key information easily.  Professor Paul Workman, chief executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and a Cancer Research UK Life Fellow, said:  The canSAR database is an important part of the overall drive to use Big Data approaches to understand and treat cancer more effectively. canSAR is a massively powerful resource that s used globally by researchers to gain rapid and easy to use access to a huge wealth of integrated knowledge in biology, chemistry and cancer medicine. This latest research has greatly enhanced the power of canSAR to enable scientists to select the best possible targets for future cancer drug discovery and also to help them develop really innovative drugs much more rapidly and effectively than ever before for the benefit of cancer patients worldwide.  Dr Kat Arney, Cancer Research UK s science information manager, said:  This database  makes masses of detailed scientific information about cancer available to scientists all over the world, and will speed up crucial advances in drug discovery   ultimately saving more lives. Finding new treatments for cancer can be a long and expensive process, so anything that cuts times and costs will help to bring the next generation of therapies to patients even sooner.

The Susan G. Komen breast cancer organization is funding the research with a three-year, $450,000 grant. Steinmetz also received a $144,000 grant from the American Heart Association for a separate project: developing a transporter to deliver clot-busting drugs to the site of blood clots before they trigger heart attacks or strokes. In both projects, researchers will manipulate plant viruses the size of nanoparticles to deliver protection from these killer diseases but in very different ways. Aggressive cancer About one in five cases of breast cancer are a form called HER2+ cancer. A mutation in the cancer cells causes an increase in production of the protein, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which, in turn, promotes uncontrolled cancer cell reproduction. The cancer is treated with chemotherapy and an antibody called trastuzumab. But the treatment doesn t work for all women, is costly and produces several unwanted side effects, including heart damage in some patients. Steinmetz and colleagues propose to make a vaccine that would trick the body s immune system into attacking the HER2 proteins, thereby providing protection.  It s complex to attack the disease,  Steinmetz said.  Humans generate HER2 so the protein doesn t naturally trigger an immune response.  Triggering immunity The researchers plan to link HER2 epitopes, which are peptides they believe can elicit protective immunity against cancer, to potato virus X. Potato virus X is a non-toxic nanoparticle, but would be recognized as a foreign invader by the body. Immune cells would steer the vaccine particles into the lymph system and spleen, which would produce antibodies to the virus and, more importantly, HER2 protein, thereby providing a long-lasting protective immunity to HER2+ cancer. The scientists predict the vaccine would reduce the risk of cancer, its progression and recurrence, and metastasis. The vaccine wouldn t necessarily be for general consumption, but for women with a family history of HER2+ breast cancer and to protect those who have just undergone surgery to remove an HER2+ tumor against metastasis.  Metastatic disease is what kills most patients,  Steinmetz said.  Before the doctor sees metastatic activity, this vaccine attacks.  Steinmetz grows the potato X virus in tobacco plants and will begin growing it in leaf lettuces and other plants. She is working with Case Western Reserve School of Medicine s Ruth Keri, professor of pharmacology; Alan Levine, professor of medicine, and Julian Kim, professor of surgery and chief, Division of Surgical Oncology, Seidman Cancer Center. They plan to develop and test the vaccine in preclinical studies. While this work focuses on HER2+ breast cancer, the researchers believe that, if successful, the technology could be used also to treat other HER2+ cancers: ovarian, pancreatic and prostate. Targeting trouble In her second project, Steinmetz will use another of nature s nanoparticles the tobacco mosaic virus to deliver clot-busters directly to clots that cause a heart attack or stroke. Currently, doctors inject medicines to dissolve clots, but the drugs circulate throughout the body and carry the risk of causing life-threatening bleeding in the brain. Steinmetz is working with Daniel Simon, chief of cardiovascular medicine at University Hospitals Case Medical Center and the Herman K. Hellerstein Professor of Cardiovascular Research at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine; Jonathan Pokorski, assistant professor of macromolecular science and engineering at Case School of Engineering; and Douglas E. Vaughan, Irving S. Cutter Professor and Chairman of the Department of Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; to reduce the risk of bleeding and the cost of treatment. Clotting is a complicated and essential process to stem bleeding from injury. But blood vessel damage from atherosclerosis and other forms of heart disease can also trigger the process, leading to heart attack, stroke or death. The researchers are focused at a point in the process when a protein, called fibrinogen, is converted to fibrin a mesh that holds blood platelets and other materials that form the clot together. They will coat the elongated tobacco virus with peptides that seek and bond with a forming clot. The virus-based nanocarrier, due to its shape, will skim blood vessel walls rather than speed by in the main flow of blood, and will carry factors that promote the body s natural clot-dissolving process when it makes contact with the target. By targeting clots, the rest of the body is not exposed to clot busters, thereby reducing both the amount of drug required and bleeding risk.","Published: January 4, 2016"

The $1.5 million grant will fund a collaborative project with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to augment the multiplexing capabilities of Transgenomic s ICE COLD-PCR  (ICP) technology. ICE COLD-PCR was originally developed by Dana-Farber, which has licensed exclusive worldwide rights to Transgenomic.  We are delighted that the NIH has recognized the value of our validated ICE COLD-PCR as an important enabling technology for precision medicine by awarding this STTR Phase II grant to Transgenomic,  notes Paul Kinnon, President and CEO of Transgenomic.  While we currently offer multiplexing capability in our ICP-powered kits and services, this grant will enable Transgenomic and Dana-Farber to accelerate development of very highly multiplexed formats for applying ICP simultaneously to hundreds or thousands of targets. We expect this will pave the way for its wide adoption and use with cutting-edge high throughput sequencing platforms and whole genome panels. We believe that ICE COLD-PCR is a powerful enabling technology that has the potential to transform precision medicine into a practical part of routine medical care, and look forward to working with our colleagues at Dana-Farber to incorporate these significantly enhanced multiplexing capabilities into the technology.  Mike Makrigiorgos, Professor of Radiation Oncology at Dana-Farber and Harvard Medical School, and principal investigator on the project for Dana-Farber, says:  The NIH/STTR funding will enable us to develop multiplexed formats for the COLD-PCR/ICE COLD-PCR technologies that filter out mutated DNA from within a high excess of normal DNA circulating in cancer patients  blood. The enhanced technology will enable multiplexed mutation enrichment, which combines well with sequencing and is key to enabling rapid and reliable mutation detection that identifies and traces mutations that may cause drug resistance, indicate remaining tumor load or provide doctors with an early indication of relapse . The STTR program is designed to promote public/private sector partnerships that include joint venture opportunities for small businesses and not-for-profit research institutions. This new Phase II STTR grant follows successful completion of a Phase I ICE COLD-PCR grant awarded to Transgenomic and Dana-Farber in 2013. ICE COLD-PCR is an enrichment technology used prior to sequencing that enhances DNA analyses by selectively amplifying only the mutated DNA that is useful for disease diagnosis, monitoring and treatment. ICP makes possible the detection of mutated DNA at very high sensitivity up to a 500-fold increase in sensitivity compared to conventional approaches. The technology ensures that all mutations are identified, including rare mutations and new mutations that have not previously been detected. The ultra-high sensitivity of ICP also allows DNA testing to be done using either tissue or liquid biopsy samples, including blood, plasma and urine. ICP is easily integrated into current laboratory workflows and can be used with standard Sanger sequencing, next generation sequencing, digital PCR and other technologies. ICE COLD-PCR was originally developed by the laboratory of Dr. Mike Makrigiorgos at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, which has exclusively licensed rights to the technology to Transgenomic.","Published: January 4, 2016"

Cancer and genetic diseases occur when this gene expression goes wrong. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an important regulator in gene expression, and they play crucial roles in almost all biological contexts including development, differentiation, inflammation, aging, and cancer. In the nucleus, miRNA start their process as a tiny, folded over hairpin structure called primary microRNA (pri-miRNA) and is recognized and processed by the Microprocessor complex, an enzyme arrangement made up of one DROSHA and two DGCR8 proteins. The Microprocessor complex does two things: it measures the pri-miRNA then snips off its basal parts, resulting in precursor-microRNA (pre-miRNA). After some further processing, mature miRNA and RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) interact with messenger RNA (mRNA) in the cytoplasm to repress translation which stops the ribosome from making protein. While this process has been studied thoroughly over the last decade, the molecular basis of Microprocessor is still poorly understood because the structures of the proteins have not been sufficiently revealed yet. Scientists working at the IBS Center for RNA Research in South Korea are at the forefront of discovering and mapping out the complexities of the structures involved in this process of pri-miRNA biogenesis. A team led by V. Narry Kim has for the first time elucidated a three dimensional image of DROSHA, one part of the Microprocessor complex. Until now, no one has been able to obtain DROSHA's crystal structure. With this discovery, the IBS team was able to confirm their previous findings (Cell Nguyen et al., 2015) which revealed the composition and detailed action mechanism of the Microprocessor complex. This work showed that DROSHA has two DGCR8-binding sites, giving a clear picture of how Microprocessor is assembled. After understanding its structure they were able to determine how DROSHA, along with DGCR8, interact together to determine the cleavage sites in pri-miRNA. Previously they observed that Microprocessor complex cuts the middle stem region of the pri-miRNA at a distance of 11 base pairs from the basal junction. The current research helped them to determine that the shape of DROSHA has unique physical characteristics, including a ""bump"", which may accommodate pri-miRNA perfectly. This bump may act as a measuring guide and indicates the 11-base-pair distance for DROSHA to cleave. When they looked at DROSHA, they noticed that it bore some striking structural similarities to the Dicer enzyme, despite Dicer existing and functioning away from DROSHA. They have hypothesized that DROSHA may have evolved from a Dicer homologue. Attempts to purify the over-expressed DROSHA protein for study have previously been impossible and have been hindered by technical difficulties. Without exacting care, DROSHA is easily aggregated during a protein purification process, thereby becoming unsuccessful crystallization. To maintain its structural integrity, the team co-expressed 23 amino acids from DGCR8 which binds and covers hydrophobic surface of DROSHA, keeping DROSHA intact. According to IBS researcher Jae-Sung Woo, ""Without this hydrophobic interaction, the DROSHA proteins will fold abnormally and aggregate,"" thus rendering them useless. Because the proteins were maintained, the team was able to perform x-ray crystallography and get the first clear image of their structure. Understanding DROSHA's structure is another crucial step in the process of understanding microRNA biogenesis. Building on this knowledge is the basis for devising new ways of regulating and controlling gene expression, which has a range of applications including building new antifungals and stopping tumor growth. Being able to more precisely control RNAi may be on the forefront of combating otherwise untreatable bacterial infections as antibiotics resistance grows. Achieving this imaging breakthrough opens the door for a better understanding and exciting new applications in cell reproduction. ""In the future,"" says researcher Sung Chul Kwon, ""we are planning to solve the structure of pri-miRNA-bound Microprocessor complex.""","Published: January 4, 2016"

The compound, BPN14770, was developed by Tetra Discovery Partners, with support from the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network, a program designed to facilitate the discovery and development of novel neurological treatments. It is the first compound funded by the program to reach a Phase 1 clinical trial.  We are pleased that BPN14770 has moved into a clinical study and we are eagerly awaiting the outcomes of the safety trial,  said Amir Tamiz, Ph.D., program director at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). The phase 1 study is being funded by the NINDS and the NIH s National Institute on Aging. The compound is a first in class phosphodiesterase 4D negative allosteric modulator (PDE4D-NAM). PDE4D is an enzyme that plays a role in the formation of connections between brain cells. In addition, blocking PDE4D increases activity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, a protein that enhances learning and memory. Rolipram is a different type of PDE4 inhibitor that has been shown to improve cognitive performance in mouse models of Alzheimer s disease, stroke and traumatic brain injury. Although rolipram has been effective in animal studies, it is not used clinically due to serious side effects. BPN14770 may be a possible treatment for dementia and Alzheimer s disease with less potential for side effects than rolipram. The Phase 1 trial will test the safety and pharmacokinetics (what happens to the drug inside the body) of the compound in 48 healthy volunteers. If deemed safe, the next phase of testing will examine its effects on long-term memory and other aspects of cognition. The NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network is a unique program that matches research scientists with drug discovery and development consultants and contract research organizations to speed up the rate at which potential drugs discovered in the lab move into clinical trials. Many principal investigators may not have the experience or resources to turn a newly discovered compound into a therapy. The Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network grants them access to drug discovery experts who can guide them during the discovery and development stages.  The goal of the Blueprint Neurotherapuetics Network is to rapidly move promising ideas for treating seemingly incurable neurological disorders from the lab bench to the bedside. The Network achieves this goal through collaborations between researchers, consultants and contractors. The consultants and contractors in the Neurotherapeutics Network provide their expertise to help investigators, many of whom may be new to drug development,  said Dr. Tamiz.

A team from the Vetmeduni Vienna has now reported for the first time that B. cereus, following contact with certain antibiotics, can switch into a special slowed-down mode. The bacteria then form small colony variants (SVCs) that are difficult to diagnose and almost impossible to treat with certain antibiotics. This newly discovered mechanism may provide an alternative explanation for antibiotic resistance.  The bacterium B. cereus had so far been considered to be exclusively endospore-forming. In response to harsh conditions, the bacteria form protective endospores enabling them to remain dormant for extended periods. When conditions are more favourable, the endospores reactivate to become fully functioning bacteria. Elrike Frenzel, Markus Kranzler and Monika Ehling-Schulz of the Institute of Microbiology at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna have now shown for the first time that B. cereus has an alternative lifestyle in the form of so called small colony variants (SCVs). In B. cereus these SCVs form in response to exposure with aminoglycoside antibiotics. SCVs grow slower than the original form of B. cereus. They have an altered metabolism and are resistant to those antibiotics which triggered this state, namely aminoglycosides.  The bacterium protects itself against the harmful effects of the antibiotics by forming these Small Colony Variants. But B. cereus is usually treated with exactly those antibiotics which induce the SCV state. If an antibiotic triggers the formation of SCVs, it also triggers resistance,  first author Frenzel explains.   Rethinking therapy and diagnostics The mechanism discovered by Frenzel, Kranzler and Ehling-Schulz is of enormous significance in clinical practice. Traditional diagnostic methods are based on the identification of metabolic features of B. cereus. These tests will not detect SCVs, however, as they have a slower, altered metabolism. This may result in incorrect antibiotic therapies or even failed diagnoses. Study author Frenzel sees molecular-based diagnostics as the only way to diagnose this form of B. cereus. Treating B. cereus infections using only aminoglycoside antibiotics could bear the risk of a prolonged infection. SCVs grow more slowly, but they still produce toxins that are harmful to the body.  In this case, a combination therapy with other antibiotic groups is advisable,  Frenzel recommends. New molecular mechanism of SCV formation One species of bacteria that has been known for years to be a multiresistant hospital pathogen and which poses a life-threatening risk for immunocompromised individuals in particular is Staphylococcus aureus. Those bacteria also form SCVs, but unlike B. cereus they are capable of reverting to its original state. For B. cereus, the adaptation to a small colony variant appears to be final.  We believe that the SCV formation in B. cereus functions differently than in S. aureus,  says study author Ehling-Schulz. Environmental niche to cope with stress  The ability to form SCVs appears to be of environmental significance for the bacteria,  Frenzel believes.  This alternative lifestyle allows the bacteria to avoid threatening stress factors such as antibiotic exposure. B. cereus are soil-dwelling, and other microorganism in the soil produce antibiotics. Here, too, the formation of SCVs would be an advantage for the bacteria. ","Published: January 4, 2016"

Making these miniature factories cell-free, which eliminates the maintenance of a living system, simplifies the process and lowers cost.  With this approach, we can produce more protein faster, making our technology ideal for point-of-care use,  Retterer said.  The fact it s cell-free reduces the infrastructure needed to produce the protein and opens the possibility of creating proteins when and where you need them, bypassing the challenge of keeping the proteins cold during shipment and storage. ORNL s bioreactor features elegance through a permeable nanoporous membrane and serpentine design fabricated using a combination of electron beam and photolithography and advanced material deposition processes. This design enables prolonged cell-free reactions for efficient production of proteins, making it easily adaptable for use in isolated locations and at disaster sites. From a functional perspective, the design uses long serpentine channels integrated in a way to allow the exchange of materials between parallel reactor and feeder channels. With this approach, the team can control the exchange of metabolites, energy and species that inhibit production of the desired protein. Through other design features, researchers extend reaction times and improve yields.  We show that the microscale bioreactor design produces higher protein yields than conventional tube-based batch formats and that product yields can be dramatically improved by facilitating small molecule exchange with the dual-channel bioreactor,  the authors wrote in their paper. The researchers also note that on-demand biologic synthesis would aid the production of drugs that are costly to mass-produce, including orphan drugs and personalized medicines. Funding for this project was provided by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency through a collaboration with researchers from Leidos (https://www.leidos.com) and Northwestern University.

The NORAD gene, however, does not encode a protein. Instead, NORAD produces a long noncoding RNA, a type of molecule that was not previously known to be important in chromosome maintenance, the researchers report.  In the absence of the NORAD RNA, the number of chromosomes in cells becomes highly abnormal,  explained Dr. Joshua Mendell, Professor of Molecular Biology at UT Southwestern and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator.  This is an entirely new function for a noncoding RNA and may have implications in cancer biology since genomic instability is a hallmark of tumor cells.  Researchers began studying this particular molecule because the RNA kicks into action after DNA is damaged; they therefore termed it Noncoding RNA Activated by DNA Damage, or NORAD. The scientists unexpectedly found that NORAD plays a critical role in keeping the genome stable, and conducted experiments showing that when NORAD is absent, cells frequently lose or gain whole chromosomes. Microscopic imaging revealed that cells lacking NORAD are unable to properly pass on chromosomes as they divide. NORAD controls chromosome segregation during cell division by regulating the activity of a family of proteins called PUMILIO proteins. In cells lacking NORAD, overactivity of PUMILIO leads to an unstable genome. Since most cancer cells also exhibit genomic instability, Dr. Mendell and his team are now exploring whether abnormal function of NORAD or PUMILIO proteins contribute to human tumors. Dr. Mendell, a member of the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine and the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, and a Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) Scholar in Cancer Research, has been a leader in the study of other types of noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs, which are involved in regulating gene activity, and play important roles in development and disease. By investigating the roles of microRNAs and other noncoding RNAs, the Mendell lab is hoping to eventually develop new therapies that have the potential to treat cancer and other diseases. Dr. Mendell, recipient of the 2016 Edith and Peter O Donnell Award in Medicine from The Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas (TAMEST), has previously shown how microRNAs play a key role in the ability of a well-known, cancer-promoting protein, MYC, to drive tumor formation. The Mendell lab has revealed involvement of microRNAs in several other critical cancer pathways and showed that these molecules are important for wound healing.","Published: January 4, 2016"

If efficiently and safely scaled up in DMD patients, this technique could lead to one of the first successful genome editing-based treatments for this fatal disease, researchers said. DMD, the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy among boys, is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. It is caused by mutations in the X-linked DMD gene that encodes the protein dystrophin. The disease affects one in 3,500 to 5,000 boys, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other estimates, and often leads to premature death by the early 30s. Although the genetic cause of DMD has been known for nearly 30 years, no effective treatments exist. The disease breaks down muscle fibers and replaces them with fibrous or fatty tissue, causing the muscle to gradually weaken. This condition often results in heart muscle disease, or cardiomyopathy, the leading cause of death in these patients. In the study published in Science, UTSW researchers used a gene-editing approach to permanently correct the DMD mutation that causes the disease in young mice.  This is different from other therapeutic approaches, because it eliminates the cause of the disease,  said senior author Dr. Eric Olson, Chairman of Molecular Biology, and Co-Director of the Senator Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Center at UT Southwestern. In 2014, Dr. Olson s team first used this technique   called CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing   to correct the mutation in the germ line of mice and prevent muscular dystrophy. This paved the way for novel genome editing-based therapeutics in DMD. It also raised several challenges for clinical applications of gene editing. Since germ line editing is not feasible in humans, strategies would need to be developed to deliver gene-editing components to postnatal tissues. To test this out, researchers delivered gene-editing components to the mice via adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9). DMD mice treated with this technique produced dystrophin protein and progressively showed improved structure and function of skeletal muscle and heart.  AAV9 can efficiently infect humans in a tissue-specific manner, but it does not cause human disease or toxicity. It s a molecular missile for gene therapy,  said Dr. Leonela Amoasii, a postdoctoral researcher in the Olson lab and co-lead author of the study with Dr. Chengzu Long, Instructor of Molecular Biology.  The CRISPR/Cas9 system is an adaptive immune system of single-celled organisms against invading virus. Ironically, this system was hijacked, we packaged it into a nonpathogenic virus, and corrected a genetic mutation in an animal model,  added Dr. Long. The CRISPR genome-editing technology, which was developed by a researcher at University of California at Berkeley, was picked as the  Breakthrough of the Year  scientific development by Science.  This study represents a very important translational application of genome editing of DMD mutations in young mice. It s a solid step toward a practical cure for DMD,  said Dr. Rhonda Bassel-Duby, Professor of Molecular Biology and Co-Principal Investigator of a genomic editing project with Dr. Olson at the Wellstone Center.  Importantly, in principle, the same strategy can be applied to numerous types of mutations within the human DMD patients,  added Dr. Olson, who also serves as Director of the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine, and holds the Annie and Willie Nelson Professorship in Stem Cell Research, the Pogue Distinguished Chair in Research on Cardiac Birth Defects, and the Robert A. Welch Distinguished Chair in Science. Now, the research team is working to apply this gene-editing technique to cells from DMD patients and in larger preclinical animal models. This marks the first major finding of the UTSW Wellstone Center, which was recently established with $7.8 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health. UTSW is one of six Wellstone Centers across the country, which work to translate scientific findings and technological developments into novel treatments for muscular dystrophy, and to promote basic, translational, and clinical research. UT Southwestern s Wellstone Center focuses on Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  The recent groundbreaking discoveries from the Olson laboratory using genome editing to correct the genetic mutation that causes DMD have accelerated the race to find a cure for this deadly disease,  said Dr. Pradeep Mammen, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine and Co-Director of the UTSW Wellstone Center.  The challenge now lies before Wellstone Center researchers to translate these discoveries in the mouse model of DMD into a therapy for patients with DMD. ","Published: January 1, 2016"

Researchers also were able to tie the traits to specific chromosomes, providing important clues to the genetic nature of the disorder, as well as potential new avenues for prevention and treatment.  We were able to identify 13 sleep and activity measures, most of which are inherited, that correlated with whether an individual had bipolar disorder. In addition, we were able to trace some of these traits to a specific chromosome,  said Dr. Joseph Takahashi, Chairman of Neuroscience and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator at UT Southwestern, who holds the Loyd B. Sands Distinguished Chair in Neuroscience.  This study represents a key step in identifying the genetic roots of this disorder and, in turn, providing targets for new approaches to preventing and treating bipolar disorder,  said Dr. Nelson Freimer, who directs the Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics and holds the Maggie Gilbert Chair of Psychiatry at UCLA. Bipolar disorder, or manic-depressive illness, causes dramatic mood shifts   often called episodes   in which the person is overly excited, extremely sad or depressed, or a mixed state of both, including irritable or explosive behavior, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, part of the National Institutes of Health. Causes of bipolar disorder (BP) are thought to be both genetic and environmental, and researchers have long suspected that disruption in normal daily circadian rhythms, including sleep and wake cycles, can precede mood shifts. Researchers here found that those with bipolar disorder awoke later and slept longer, on average were awake fewer minutes overall, and were active for shorter periods than those without the disorder. Researchers also found that those with bipolar disorder displayed lower activity levels while awake and had greater variations in sleep and wake cycles. The findings are reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study, involving more than 500 members of 26 families from Costa Rica and Colombia, identified because they each include many individuals with severe bipolar disorder, is the first large-scale delineation of sleep and activity traits in BP-affected individuals and their relatives and the first genetic investigation of such a comprehensive set of sleep and circadian measures in any human study. The 13 endophenotypes (biological or behavioral markers found more commonly in those with a certain disease than without) are: mean of awake duration, amplitude, Hill acrophase, interdaily stability, interdaily variability, median activity, relative amplitude, mean length of sleep bouts during the sleep period, mean number of sleep bouts during awake period, time of sleep offset, time of sleep onset, mean total minutes scored awake, and WASO (total minutes in awake bouts after sleep onset).","Published: December 30, 2015"

Previously, genes that encode the recipe for making proteins have been implicated in maintaining the proper number of chromosomes in a cell. The NORAD gene, however, does not encode a protein. Instead, NORAD produces a long noncoding RNA, a type of molecule that was not previously known to be important in chromosome maintenance, the researchers report in the journal Cell.  In the absence of the NORAD RNA, the number of chromosomes in cells becomes highly abnormal,  explained Dr. Joshua Mendell, Professor of Molecular Biology at UT Southwestern and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator.  This is an entirely new function for a noncoding RNA and may have implications in cancer biology since genomic instability is a hallmark of tumor cells.  Researchers began studying this particular molecule because the RNA kicks into action after DNA is damaged; they therefore termed it Noncoding RNA Activated by DNA Damage, or NORAD. The scientists unexpectedly found that NORAD plays a critical role in keeping the genome stable, and conducted experiments showing that when NORAD is absent, cells frequently lose or gain whole chromosomes. Microscopic imaging revealed that cells lacking NORAD are unable to properly pass on chromosomes as they divide. NORAD controls chromosome segregation during cell division by regulating the activity of a family of proteins called PUMILIO proteins. In cells lacking NORAD, overactivity of PUMILIO leads to an unstable genome. Since most cancer cells also exhibit genomic instability, Dr. Mendell and his team are now exploring whether abnormal function of NORAD or PUMILIO proteins contribute to human tumors. Dr. Mendell, a member of the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine and the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, and a Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) Scholar in Cancer Research, has been a leader in the study of other types of noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs, which are involved in regulating gene activity, and play important roles in development and disease. By investigating the roles of microRNAs and other noncoding RNAs, the Mendell lab is hoping to eventually develop new therapies that have the potential to treat cancer and other diseases. Dr. Mendell, recipient of the 2016 Edith and Peter O Donnell Award in Medicine from The Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas (TAMEST), has previously shown how microRNAs play a key role in the ability of a well-known, cancer-promoting protein, MYC, to drive tumor formation. The Mendell lab has revealed involvement of microRNAs in several other critical cancer pathways and showed that these molecules are important for wound healing.","Published: December 30, 2015"

Crucially, the scientists have discovered that these two networks   which each contain hundreds of genes   are likely to be under the control of master regulator switches. The researchers are now keen to identify these switches and explore whether it might be feasible to manipulate them. The research is at a very early stage, but the scientists would ultimately like to investigate whether it is possible to use this knowledge of gene networks to boost cognitive function. Dr Michael Johnson, lead author of the study from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, said:  We know that genetics plays a major role in intelligence but until now haven t known which genes are relevant. This research highlights some of genes involved in human intelligence, and how they interact with each other. What s exciting about this is that the genes we have found are likely to share a common regulation, which means that potentially we can manipulate a whole set of genes whose activity is linked to human intelligence. Our research suggests that it might be possible to work with these genes to modify intelligence, but that is only a theoretical possibility at the moment   we have just taken a first step along that road.  In the study, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, the international team of researchers looked at samples of human brain from patients who had undergone neurosurgery for epilepsy. The investigators analyzed thousands of genes expressed in the human brain, and then combined these results with genetic information from healthy people who had undergone IQ tests and from people with neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. They conducted various computational analyses and comparisons in order to identify the gene networks influencing healthy human cognitive abilities. Remarkably, they found that some of the same genes that influence human intelligence in healthy people were also the same genes that cause impaired cognitive ability and epilepsy when mutated. Dr Johnson added:  Traits such intelligence are governed by large groups of genes working together   like a football team made up of players in different positions. We used computer analysis to identify the genes in the human brain that work together to influence our cognitive ability to make new memories or sensible decisions when faced with lots of complex information. We found that some of these genes overlap with those that cause severe childhood onset epilepsy or intellectual disability.  This study shows how we can use large genomic datasets to uncover new pathways for human brain function in both health and disease. Eventually, we hope that this sort of analysis will provide new insights into better treatments for neurodevelopmental diseases such as epilepsy, and ameliorate or treat the cognitive impairments associated with these devastating diseases.

As reported advanced online on December 21 in Nature Methods, the platform allows researchers to gain new insights into the disease mechanisms, identify novel biomarkers and test new drug candidates. COPD and asthma are inflammatory reactions in the lung which can be dramatically exacerbated by viral and bacterial infections, as well as smoking. It is known that many of the associated disease processes occur in the conducting airway sections of the lung that shuttle air to and from the alveoli or air sacs. However, much less is known about how inflammation induces distinct pathological processes such as the recruitment of circulating white blood cells and the buildup of mucus, which compromise the lungs of these patients, or how clinical exacerbations are triggered. ""Inspired by our past work using the organ-on-a-chip approach to model the lung alveolus, we created a new microfluidic model of the lung small airway that recapitulates critical features of asthma and COPD with unprecedented fidelity and detail. Now with this microengineered human lung small airway, we can study lung inflammatory diseases over several weeks in chips lined by cells from both normal donors and diseased patients to gain better insight into disease mechanisms, as well as screen for new therapeutics,"" said Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., the senior author on this work who is leading a multidisciplinary team of Wyss scientists that has been at the forefront of organ-on-chip technology. He is also the Wyss Institute's Founding Director, the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Demand for such opportunities is especially high since small airway inflammation cannot be adequately studied in human patients or animal models and, to date, there are no effective therapies that can stop or reverse the complex and widespread inflammation-driven processes. ""To closely mimic the complex 3D cellular architecture of actual human small airways, we designed a microfluidic device that contains a fully matured human small airway epithelium with different specialized cell types exposed to air in one of its two parallel microchannels. The second channel is lined by a human vascular endothelium in which we flow medium containing white blood cells and nutrients so that the living microsystem can be maintained over weeks. We then modeled inflammatory asthma and COPD conditions by adding an asthma-inducing immune factor or by setting up the system with lung epithelial cells obtained from patients with COPD,"" said Remi Villenave, Ph.D., a former postdoctoral fellow in Ingber s group and the co-first author on the publication. In both cases, the team was not only able to observe highly disease- and cell type-specific changes but could also exacerbate them with agents simulating viral or bacterial infection. ""This new organ-on-a-chip technology gives us a window on molecular-scale activities in the context of living human lung tissue. It also provides us with a handle to dissect contributions of specific cell types and biochemical factors to small airway diseases, including how circulating immune cells are recruited to inflammation sites and how compromised cilia function contributes to abnormal mucus clearance in the lungs of diseased patients,"" said Kambez Hajipouran Benam, Ph.D., who also is a postdoctoral fellow working with Ingber and the other co-first author of the study. Finally, the team provided proof-of-principle that the synthetic small airway-on-a-chip can be utilized as a discovery platform for disease-specific drugs and biomarkers. In collaboration with two different industrial partners -Pfizer and Merck Research Laboratories   who also helped fund the project, together with support from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), the Wyss researchers showed that two drugs targeting different key molecular components of inflammatory pathways can potently suppress pathological processes in asthma and COPD-tailored small airway chips. The Wyss scientists also identified a macrophage-recruiting factor whose levels are raised by a viral mimic in the COPD model and which can be further investigated as a potential specific biomarker for viral exacerbations of COPD. ""This novel ability to build small airway chips with cells from individual patients with diseases like COPD positions us and others now to investigate the effects of genetic variability, specific immune cell populations, pharmaceutical candidates and even pandemic viruses in an entirely new and more personalized way; one that will hopefully increase the likelihood of success of future therapeutics,"" said Ingber.","Published: December 24, 2015"

A newly reported study, led by Liana Apostolova, MD, Barbara and Peer Baekgaard Professor of Alzheimer's Disease Research at the Indiana University School of Medicine, also found that the proteins produced by the genes and circulating in the blood were associated with the brain atrophy and could be used in Alzheimer's-related tests in the future. The study is believed to be the first to directly link common variants of the genes ABCA7 and MA4A6A to atrophy in cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain, which are associated with memory and other key functions. It's also believed to be the first to link the atrophy to protein levels in the blood produced by the genes. ""We also found that the levels of the protein products of these genes, circulating in the peripheral blood, were associated with the cortical and hippocampal atrophy. This finding suggests that those results of gene expression could become useful biomarker blood tests for Alzheimer's disease,"" Apostolova said. The study is published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging. There is no cure for Alzheimer's and currently available treatments can slow, but cannot stop, the deterioration associated with the disease. Although scientists have been linking a growing number of gene variants to the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, most of the associations have not identified the specific mechanisms that would increase the risk of developing the disease. For the new study, the researchers identified the top nine genetic variants that have been associated with Alzheimer's disease risk, not including the APOe4 gene that has long been linked to increased risk for several characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. Using magnetic resonance imaging tools to measure brain size and genetic analysis, the researchers looked for associations between the genetic variants and atrophy in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain, which are established physical biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. The studies were conducted in 50 participants with no cognitive difficulties and 90 who had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, a condition that is associated with increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. All of the participants were 50 years or older.

These latest findings provide the first estimates of safety, tolerability and efficacy of prescription CBD in children and adults with severe, highly treatment-resistant epilepsy. Led by Orrin Devinsky, MD, professor of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry and director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at NYU Langone, the study is published in Lancet Neurology. While early findings have been released at medical meetings including the 2015 American Academy of Neurology conference these are the first findings from the trial to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The study took place at 11 epilepsy centers across the country. Patients were given the oral CBD treatment Epidiolex over a 12-week treatment period. Results showed a median 36.5 percent reduction in monthly motor seizures, with the median monthly frequency of motor seizures falling from 30 motor seizures a month at the study's start to 15.8 over the 12 weeks. Equally important, CBD was shown to have a sufficient safety profile and was well-tolerated by many patients, despite some isolated adverse events. ""We are very encouraged by our trial results showing that CBD was safe and well-tolerated for most patients, and that seizures dropped significantly,"" says Devinsky. ""But before we raise hopes for families who regularly deal with the devastation of treatment-resistant epilepsy, more research, including further studies through our ongoing randomized controlled trial, are needed to definitively recommend CBD as a treatment to patients with uncontrolled seizures."" The study was an open-labeled trial, meaning that both the researchers and participants' families knew they were receiving CBD, a compound in medical marijuana that does not contain psychoactive properties. Between January 15, 2014, and January 15, 2015, 214 patients between 1 and 30 years of age with intractable, or treatment-resistant, epilepsy were enrolled in the trial. Of that cohort, 162 (76 percent) had at least 12 weeks of follow-up after the first dose of CBD and were included in the safety and tolerability analysis. In addition, 137 of the original study cohort (64 percent) were included in the analysis to determine the drug's efficacy. Patients were given an oral CBD regimen from 2-5 mg/kg per day, with a dose up-titrated until intolerance occurred or to a maximum dose of 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg per day, depending on the trial site. Seizures were recorded by parents or caregivers in diaries and reviewed by the study team at each visit. Lab screenings also were conducted at baseline, and after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of CBD treatment. The study showed variability in responses of individual seizure types to cannabidiol treatment. For example, the median change in total seizures was 34.6 percent , with the greatest reduction occurring in patients with focal and atonic seizures followed by tonic or tonic-clonic seizures. Two patients were free of all seizure types over the entire 12 weeks. Adverse events were reported among participants, including drowsiness, decreased appetite, diarrhea, fatigue and convulsion. Most were mild to moderate and transient, but 20 patients had serious adverse events related to CBD use -most commonly status epilepticus, or seizures that last too long or too close together. Five patients had to discontinue treatment due to these adverse events. Devinsky is currently leading a randomized, controlled trial considered the gold standard of scientific research -in which CBD or a placebo is randomly assigned to patients to better tease out the drug's effects and better eliminate research bias. ""I empathize with parents who are looking for answers and will try anything to help their children suffering the devastating effects of intractable epilepsy. But we must let the science, and not anecdotal success stories and high media interest, lead this national discussion,"" cautions Devinsky.

It has long been known that the brain uses topographic organization, meaning that parts of the brain that make similar types of computations are situated close to each other (also known as brain maps or spatial computation). However, in the case of pathology, these topographies may undergo re-organization. The researchers now show that it is the continuity of these brain maps which is disturbed. Moreover, this continuity can be quantified, allowing them to be used as a biomarker for detecting neuropsychiatric disease. In order to understand this relationship, researchers from Hebrew University's Computational Neuropsychiatry Laboratory and the Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences (ELSC), as well as a neurosurgeon from Hadassah Medical Center, investigated the role of topographic organizational continuity. Using functional MRI, they studied two types of unique patient populations: patients with injury to one side of the spinal cord, which enabled comparison of disturbed and non-disturbed body sides, and patients undergoing surgical repair. This approach enabled direct comparison in human patients with respect to their own self or before and after surgical intervention. Instead of inducing lesions in animals, the team could repair the human patients and check them before and after. Importantly, unlike animals, patients could report their subjective experience, which is crucial for understanding high cognitive functions and neuropsychiatry. The researchers developed an algorithm that quantifies continuity of the patients  brain maps. Their results showed that in each individual patient, pathological processing was reflected by a discontinuity of topographic maps rather than signal reduction. ""These findings suggest that continuity is a primary principle in brain computation, but in pathological states the brain may give up on this principle in order to retrieve as much information as possible. Moreover, this may serve as a biomarker for neurological pathologies that we are now investigating,"" said neuroscientist Dr. Shahar Arzy, director of the Computational Neuropsychiatry Laboratory, who led the team. The researchers are now fine-tuning their findings in neurosurgical patients in order to enable a better patient-tailored diagnosis and follow-up. In addition they are extending their findings to other kinds of brain processing such as vision, hearing, number processing and memory. Earlier this year, the Hebrew University team published research in PNAS that earned them best scientific paper award by the Israeli Neurological Association for 2015. In that paper titled 'Brain system for mental orientation in space, time, and person,' the Computational Neuropsychiatry Laboratory, together with researchers from the Swiss Institute of Technology (EPFL), in the framework of HUJI-EPFL collaboration, unraveled another mystery: the brain function that relates the behaving self to the environment, what they call  mental-orientation.  Through high-resolution functional MRI scanning, the team showed that mental orientation in space, time and person produces a sequential and partially overlapping posterior-anterior pattern of activity in the brain. Based on these findings, the researchers showed that mental orientation is managed by a specific brain system with a highly ordered internal organization. The researchers hypothesized that it is this mental-orientation system that is disturbed in Alzheimer s disease.  Behavioral and functional neuroimaging examination of this system may therefore enable early detection of Alzheimer s disease,  said Arzy,  far before clinical signs are evident, which is crucial for presentation of preventive treatment.  The researchers in the Neuropsychiatry Lab have already tested their hypothesis in patients. Their initial results have already won them the first prize by the International Neuropsychiatry Association for 2015. The researcher also designed an Android-based App for the developed test. Full results as well as the free App for diagnosis and follow up of Alzheimer s disease will be available in the coming months. The research was conducted in the Computational Neuropsychiatry Laboratory, co-located in both the Department of Clinical Neuroscience at Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School in the Faculty of Medicine, and the Department of Neurology at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. This unique lab combines clinical practice and research in neurology, psychiatry, computer science, physics and psychology, and applies state-of-the-art computational methods on precious clinical data, enabling researchers to perform sophisticated analyses and modeling and improve scientific understanding of the human self in health and in disease. Working with neurological and psychiatric patients in the department of neurology, neuropsychiatry clinic, invasive neurophysiological unit and in the operating room, the Lab uses state of the art computational methods applied directly to clinical data, particularly tailored to improve clinical management and scientific understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders. The multidisciplinary team of medical doctors, physicists, computer scientists and psychologists use tools including fMRI, multi-channel EEG, intracranial EEG, virtual reality, and direct cortical stimulation to investigate and help patients in real-time.  Our main interests involve conditions including epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, conversive and dissociative disorders, amnesias, disorientation states and different cognitive disturbances and misperceptions,  said Dr. Shahar Arzy, director of the Computational Neuropsychiatry Laboratory.  By combining direct clinical involvement and cutting-edge computational methods we are able to reframe neuropsychiatry and at the same time to develop effective patient-tailored clinical tools, which fits the new digital era of computational revolution and precision medicine.   We have the best students available from both the natural sciences and The Hebrew University s MD-PhD program , said Dr. Arzy.  With high computational skills, medical insights and extreme motivation, they dedicate their talent to both understanding the mysteries of the human brain and at the same time solving the most crucial needs in clinical practice.

But even under repeated stress, brief opportunities for recovery can open up, according to new research at The Rockefeller University.  Even after a long period of chronic stress, the brain retains the ability to change and adapt. In experiments with mice, we discovered the mechanism that alters expression of key glutamate-controlling genes to make windows of stress-related neuroplasticity and potential recovery possible,  says senior author Bruce McEwen, Alfred E. Mirsky Professor, and head of the Harold and Margaret Milliken Hatch Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter implicated in stress-related disorders, including depression.  This sensitive window could provide an opportunity for treatment, when the brain is most responsive to efforts to restore neural circuitry in the affected areas,  he adds. The team, including McEwen and first author Carla Nasca, wanted to know how a history of stress could alter the brain s response to further stress. To find out, they accustomed mice to a daily experience they dislike, confinement in a small space for a short period. On the 22nd day, they introduced some of those mice to a new stressor; others received the now-familiar confinement. Then, the researchers tested both groups for anxiety- or depression-like behaviors. A telling split emerged: Mice tested shortly after the receiving the familiar stressor showed fewer of those behaviors; meanwhile those given the unfamiliar stressor, displayed more. The difference was transitory, however; by 24 hours after the final stressor, the behavioral improvements seen in half of the mice had disappeared. Molecular analyses revealed a parallel fluctuation in a part of the hippocampus a brain region involved in the stress response. A key molecule, mGlu2, which tamps down the release of glutamate, increased temporarily in mice subjected to the familiar confinement stress. Meanwhile, a molecular glutamate booster, NMDA, increased in other mice that experienced the unfamiliar stressor. In stress-related disorders, excessive glutamate causes harmful structural changes in the brain. The researchers also identified the molecule regulating the regulator, an enzyme called P300. By adding chemical groups to proteins known as histones, which give support and structure to DNA, P300 increases expression of mGlu2, they found. In other experiments, they looked at mice genetically engineered to carry a genetic variant associated with development of depression and other stress-related disorders in humans, and present in 33 percent of the population.  Here again, in experiments relevant to humans, we saw the same window of plasticity, with the same up-then-down fluctuations in mGlu2 and P300 in the hippocampus,  Nasca says.  This result suggests we can take advantage of these windows of plasticity through treatments, including the next generation of drugs, such as acetyl carnitine, that target mGlu2 not to  roll back the clock  but rather to change the trajectory of such brain plasticity toward more positive directions.

The same can be said of our cells. Mature cells, such as skin or blood cells, have a cellular  memory,  or record of how the cell changed as it developed from an uncommitted embryonic cell into a specialized adult cell. Now, Harvard Stem Cell Institute researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), in collaboration with scientists from the Institutes of Molecular Biotechnology (IMBA) and Molecular Pathology (IMP) in Vienna, have identified genes that, when suppressed effectively, erase a cell s memory, making it more susceptible to reprogramming and, consequently, making the process of reprogramming quicker and more efficient.  We began this work because we wanted to know why a skin cell is a skin cell, and why does it not change its identity the next day, or the next month, or a year later?  said co-senior author Konrad Hochedlinger, an HSCI principal faculty member at MGH and Harvard s Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, and a world expert in cellular reprogramming. Every cell in the human body has the same genome, or DNA blueprint, explained Hochedlinger, and it is how those genes are turned on and off during development that determines what kind of adult cell each becomes. By manipulating those genes and introducing new factors, scientists can unlock dormant parts of an adult cell s genome and reprogram it into another cell type. However,  a skin cell knows it is a skin cell,  said IMBA s Josef Penninger, even after scientists reprogram those skin cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells)   a process that would ideally require a cell to  forget  its identity before assuming a new one. Cellular memory is often conserved, acting as a roadblock to reprogramming.  We wanted to find out which factors stabilize this memory and what mechanism prevents iPS cells from forming,  Penninger said. To identify potential factors, the team established a genetic library targeting known chromatin regulators   genes that control the packaging and bookmarking of DNA, and are involved in creating cellular memory. Hochedlinger and Sihem Cheloufi, co-first author and a postdoc in Hochedlinger s lab, designed a screening approach that tested each of these factors. Of the 615 factors screened, the researchers identified four chromatin regulators, three of which had not yet been described, as potential roadblocks to reprogramming. In comparison to the three- to fourfold increase seen by suppressing previously known roadblock factors, inhibiting the newly described chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF1) made the process 50- to 200-fold more efficient. Moreover, in the absence of CAF1, reprogramming turned out to be much faster: While the process normally takes nine days, the researchers could detect the first iPS cell after four days.  The CAF1 complex ensures that during DNA replication and cell division, daughter cells keep their memory, which is encoded on the histones that the DNA is wrapped around,  said Ulrich Elling, a co-first author from IMBA.  When we block CAF1, daughter cells fail to wrap their DNA the same way, lose this information, and covert into blank sheets of paper. In this state, they respond more sensitively to signals from the outside, meaning we can manipulate them much more easily.  By suppressing CAF1 the researchers were also able to facilitate the conversion of one type of adult cell directly into another, skipping the intermediary step of forming iPS cells, via a process called direct reprogramming, or transdifferentiation. Thus, CAF1 appears to act as a general guardian of cell identity whose depletion facilitates both the interconversion of one adult cell type to another as well as the conversion of specialized cells into iPS cells. In finding CAF1, the researchers identified a complex that allows cell memory to be erased and rewritten.  The cells forget who they are, making it easier to trick them into becoming another type of cell,  said Cheloufi. CAF1 may provide a general key to facilitate the  reprogramming  of cells to model disease and test therapeutic agents, IMP s Johannes Zuber explained.  The best-case scenario,  he said,  is that with this insight, we hold a universal key in our hands that will allow us to model cells at will. ","Published: December 23, 2015"

The findings, published in Scientific Reports, explain why some vestibular schwannomas cause hearing loss even though they are not large enough to compress nearby structures that control hearing. ""What's written in textbooks is that these tumors cause hearing loss by growing to the point of compressing the auditory nerve,"" said senior author Konstantina M Stankovic, MD, PhD, FACS, an otologic surgeon and researcher at Mass. Eye and Ear. ""We knew that it couldn't be as simple as that, because there are large tumors that do not cause hearing loss and little ones that do."" The researchers also identified TNF , a toxic compound that has been implicated in other forms of hearing loss, as a causative toxic molecule in the secretions from human vestibular schwannomas. When they applied those secretions directly to a mouse cochlea, they found that the degree of cellular damage correlated to the severity of hearing loss in humans. Hearing loss is often the first sign of a vestibular schwannoma. Also termed ""acoustic neuroma,"" vestibular schwannomas grow from the Schwann cells of the vestibular (balance) nerve in the inner ear and represent the fourth most common intracranial tumor. Though vestibular schwannoma is a hallmark of NF2, a genetic disorder causing tumors to grow throughout the nervous system, the tumors most commonly occur sporadically. Although histologically non-malignant, vestibular schwannomas growing in size can damage nearby structures and can lead to death by compressing the brainstem. By compressing nerves in the internal auditory canal, the tumors can cause vestibular dysfunction, facial nerve paralysis and sensorineural hearing loss. Currently, patients with symptomatic or growing vestibular schwannomas can undergo surgical resection of radiotherapy; however, both of these procedures can result in serious complications. The findings introduce a second way in which the tumors can cause sensorineural hearing loss, by secreting toxic molecules, including TNF . The authors are hopeful that new therapies may be developed, because there are known ways to inhibit the body's production of TNF . ""Because these are histologically non-malignant tumors, they do not need to be removed or irradiated as long as they are not growing. However, hearing can continue to decline even in patients with non-growing tumors,"" Stankovic said.

Previous research has established that the brain can recognize and categorize objects extremely rapidly, however the way this process occurs is still largely unknown. Researchers from Monash University have pioneered a new image modulation technique known as semantic wavelet-induced frequency-tagging (SWIFT) to further test how images are processed. This work, by Associate Professor Naotsugu Tsuchiya and Dr Roger Koenig-Robert from the School of Psychological Sciences (affiliates of Australian Research Council Centre for Integrative Brain Functions), identifies a way to visually stimulate the brain to isolate neural activity responsible for categorizing objects. This is not an easy task at all, because areas in the visual cortex supporting these category representations are simultaneously active with areas representing low-level visual features such as lines, forms and contrast. Categorization of objects is believed to emerge gradually, in a hierarchical manner. For example, simple visual features such as lines, contrast and color are thought to be represented at early stages. For more complex representations, these features are combined, giving rise to abstract categorization (such as cars, faces and animals), and neurons in high-level areas are believed to be responsible. By isolating the areas representing abstract, object categories in the brain, the research has allowed greater understanding of how humans effortlessly categorize objects, despite massively different appearances. Associate Professor Tsuchiya said the discovery could prove useful for manipulating images so that they communicate information in a subliminal, non-conscious manner. ""SWIFT can degrade arbitrary natural stimuli in a subtle manner. This technique may find its own application as a way to reveal and/or hide specific aspects of images. Potentially, SWIFT could be used to probe robustness and flexibility of artificial visual systems, such as those used in security,"" Associate Professor Tsuchiya said. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the study determined that in faces and scenes modulated with SWIFT, there was a sustained and constant brain response in early visual areas, and periodical responses in the higher level (category-selective) areas.

Scientists at the Medical College of Georgia (MCG) at Augusta University have shown that it's not size that seems to matter to YAP, or yes-associated protein, in the brain. Rather, YAP keeps our astrocytes the cells that typically protect and nourish neurons from becoming too reactive and essentially turning on our neurons. ""While these YAP normally control organ size, in the brain, YAP influences astrocyte function, which, in turn, helps regulate our protective blood-brain barrier function,"" said Dr. Wen-Cheng Xiong, developmental neurobiologist and Weiss Research Professor at MCG. In the body, YAP helps control the size of our major organs by regulating cell death and proliferation. But, Xiong and her colleagues found that inside the developing brain, YAP is a critical inducer of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, or SOCS3, another protein, which as the name implies, suppresses inflammation-provoking immune cells. Inflammation can be dangerous even deadly in the closed confines of the skull, where resulting swelling and pressure can destroy neurons, said Xiong, corresponding author of the study in the journal Cerebral Cortex. Xiong suspects that in conditions, such as hemorrhagic stroke and hydrocephalus, where fluid accumulates inside the skull of a baby or an adult in response to injury, a problem with YAP could be a factor. In fact in her studies, mice missing YAP also had a form of hydrocephalus that at first made Xiong suspect that YAP did help control the size of the brain. However, when the scientists dissected the too-large organ, they found it was mostly fluid. And the mice missing YAP did not induce SOCS3. ""The brake is gone and over-inflammation can occur,"" she said. YAP is expressed in both astrocytes as well as the neural stem cells that help make more astrocytes and, to a lesser extent, neurons, for the brain. Xiong and her team found that without YAP, astrocytes became hyper-reactive, creating a condition called astrogliosis where they weaken instead of strengthen the important but fragile blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier is essentially a layer of tightly knit endothelial cells that line blood vessels in the brain, a single layer of smooth muscle cells, or pericytes, on top of that, and a layer of astrocytes on the exterior. The unique configuration in the blood vessels of the brain and spinal cord create a fine filter that limits what substances can get access to brain tissue from the blood. ""The blood-brain barrier is completely disrupted in hemorrhagic stroke,"" Xiong said. ""Once that is broken, it changes everything."" Cell types and factors that normally don't have access to the brain confuse the relationships between cell types and substances that are usually there. One consequence is that fluid from the blood also gets into brain tissue, adding pressure to the confused conversations. Neurons start to die, scar tissue forms and more astrocytes form. They found levels of several SOCS proteins were lower in mice where the YAP gene was deleted from the brain. To double-check the connection between SOCS3 and YAP, they selectively expressed SOCS3 in the astrocytes of the YAP knockouts and still found less inflammation. The inflammation also seemed to focus on the blood vessels in mice missing YAP, and when they injected a dye tracer that normally cannot penetrate the blood-brain barrier, it easily penetrated into the brains of mice missing Yap from their astrocytes. Xiong wants to pursue studies examining the blood of newborns with hydrocephalus for signs of mutated YAP. A mutant form of YAP is known to cause liver cancer, in which cells just keep growing, and the Hippo signaling pathway that activates YAP has been targeted for its anti-cancer potential.

The brain helps us navigate by continually generating, rationalizing, and analyzing great amounts of in-formation. For example, this innate GPS-like function helps us find our way in cities, follow directions to a specific destination, or go to a particular restaurant to satisfy a craving. ""When people try to get from one place to another, they 'foresee' the upcoming landscape in their minds,"" said study author Yumi Shikauchi. ""We wanted to decode prior belief in the brain, because it's so crucial for spatial navigation."" Using virtual three-dimensional mazes together with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the researchers investigated whether a person's preconceptions could be represented in brain activity. Participants were led through each maze, memorizing a sequence of scenes by receiving directions for each move. Then, while being imaged using fMRI, they were asked to navigate through the maze by choosing the upcoming scene from two options. In contrast to methods in previous studies, the re-searchers focused on the underpinnings of expectation and prediction, crucial cognitive processes in everyday decision making. Twelve decoders deciphered brain activity from fMRI scans by associating signals with output variables. They were ultimately able to reconstruct what scene the participants pictured in their minds as they pro-gressed through the maze. They also discovered that the human sense of objectivity may sometimes be overpowered by precon-ception, which includes biases arising from external cues and prior knowledge. ""We found that the activity patterns in the parietal regions reflect participants' expectations even when they are wrong, demonstrating that subjective belief can override objective reality,"" said senior author Shin Ishii. Shikauchi and Ishii hope that this research will contribute to the development of new communication tools that make use of brain activity. ""There are a lot of things that can't be communicated just by words and language. As we were able to decipher virtual expectations both right and wrong, this could contribute to the development of a new type of tool that allows people to communicate non-linguistic information,"" said Ishii.

These findings, published online in Nature Neuroscience, provide an alternate starting point for scientists to develop therapies for such disorders. A team of researchers from Duke University-National University of Singapore Medical School (Duke-NUS) and Imperial College London (ICL) identified a network of genes in the brain that regulates normal cognitive abilities. This network is also linked to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, epilepsy, intellectual disability and schizophrenia. In many neurodevelopmental disorders, the impairment of cognitive abilities is reported to be a core clinical feature. However, no explanation had been provided for this association, until now.  The Duke-NUS and ICL team began their research by studying all genes that are active in the human hippocampus a component of our brains that plays an important role in the formation and consolidation of memories. They identified several gene networks and pinpointed a significant network of 150 genes, found in mice and healthy humans, which has a major influence on general cognitive abilities. In addition, they found that these genes are already highly active following birth, which is a clue that the genes play a role in brain development and neurodevelopmental disease.  Analyzing all data available to date on the genes that cause neurodevelopmental disease, the team observed that about a third of the genes in the network are mutated in various neurodevelopmental disorders. These results were unforeseen, as the majority of these genes that were known to cause neurodevelopmental disease had never been connected to each other before. The identification of this gene network provides the starting point to develop precision medicine strategies to target the entire pathway or genes specific to neurodevelopmental disorders. The Duke-NUS team aims to identify the regulatory factors of this network, which can help to develop future strategies to treat neurodevelopmental disorders. All gene network data generated from this study have been made accessible online  for other researchers and scientists.  Associate Professor Enrico Petretto, senior co-author of the study and head of the Systems Genetics of Complex Disease Laboratory at Duke-NUS, hopes that these findings will contribute to advances in the field of neurobiology and neurological disease.  We believe that studying gene networks in the brain can give us extra clues about the genetic cause of neurodevelopmental disorders and of their neurological comorbidities. The results of our study in the human brain show a previously unappreciated functional relationship between cognition and neurodevelopmental disorders  genes. This gives us the first explanation to why the two seem to be related,  said Petretto.  Duke-NUS and ICL researchers employed a novel approach called systems genetics to study networks of genes, rather than investigating the role of single genes in neurodevelopmental disease and variable cognitive abilities. In this study, the key interactions between all genes in the human brain were analyzed. These crucial interactions inform networks of genes that, like a football team, are likely to display a more complex performance than the individual player.  Petretto explained that the team s strategy to understand the genetic causes of complex disease could be compared to how one may take on a rival football team. To outplay a rival team, the focus should not be placed on a single player, even if it happens to be a key player such as Lionel Messi. Instead, understanding how the eleven players cooperate, with or without Messi s contribution, and breaking down their coach s game strategy, which in this study refers to the regulatory factors of the gene network, is critical to creating a long-term winning strategy.

This according to a new study by researchers from Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden. The findings, which are published in the journal Cerebral Cortex, suggest that environmental factors can lead to autism Extremely preterm neonates survive at increasingly early gestation periods thanks to the advances made in intensive care in the past decades. However, babies born more than 13 weeks prematurely run a serious risk of brain damage, autism, ADHD and learning difficulties. They are exposed to numerous stress factors during a period critical to brain development, and it is possible that this plays a key part in the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this present study, the researchers examined over 100 babies who had been born extremely prematurely (i.e. before week 27, the beginning of the third trimester). With the parents' permission they studied the growth of the babies' brains using magnetic resonance imaging during the neonate period, and then screened the children for autistic features when they had reached the age of six. ""We were surprised by how many almost 30 per cent of the extremely preterm-born children had developed ASD symptoms,"" says Ulrika  d n, researcher at the Department of Women's and Children's Health at Karolinska Institutet and neonatologist at the Neonatology clinic at Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden. ""Amongst children born after full term pregnancy, the corresponding figure is 1 per cent."" The researchers found that it was more common in the group of children who had developed ASD for there to have been complications during the neonate period, such as surgery, than it was amongst their prematurely born peers who had not developed ASD. Already in the neonatal period, long before the children had manifested signs of autism, differences could be observed between the extremely preterm babies who went on to develop ASD and those who did not, with diminished growth of the parts of the brain involved in social contact, empathy and language acquisition functions that are impaired in autistic children. Autism is generally attributed to genetic factors, even if no specific autism gene has been identified. This new study supports previous findings indicating that birth weight and complications can increase the risk of autism. ""Our study shows that environmental factors can also cause autism,"" says  d n. ""The brain grows best in the womb, and if the developmental environment changes too early to a life in the atmosphere, it can disrupt the organisation of cerebral networks. With new therapeutic regimes to stimulate the development of such babies and avoid stress, maybe we can reduce the risk of their developing ASD.""

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/human-small-airwayonachip-197383,Human Small Airway on a Chip A microfluidic model of human lung inflammatory disorders provides a new and systematic way to analyze disease mechanisms and test new drug candidates  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A research team at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University leveraged its organ-on-a-chip technology to develop a model of the human small airway in which lung inflammatory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of mortality worldwide, and asthma can be studied outside the human body. The platform allows researchers to gain new insights into the disease mechanisms, identify novel biomarkers and test new drug candidates.  COPD and asthma are inflammatory reactions in the lung which can be dramatically exacerbated by viral and bacterial infections, as well as smoking. It is known that many of the associated disease processes occur in the conducting airway sections of the lung that shuttle air to and from the alveoli or air sacs. However, much less is known about how inflammation induces distinct pathological processes such as the recruitment of circulating white blood cells and the buildup of mucus, which compromise the lungs of these patients, or how clinical exacerbations are triggered. ""Inspired by our past work using the organ-on-a-chip approach to model the lung alveolus, we created a new microfluidic model of the lung small airway that recapitulates critical features of asthma and COPD with unprecedented fidelity and detail.  Now with this microengineered human lung small airway, we can study lung inflammatory diseases over several weeks in chips lined by cells from both normal donors and diseased patients to gain better insight into disease mechanisms, as well as screen for new therapeutics,"" said Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., the senior author on this work who is leading a multidisciplinary team of Wyss scientists that has been at the forefront of organ-on-chip technology. He is also the Wyss Institute's Founding Director, the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology  at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Demand for such opportunities is especially high since small airway inflammation cannot be adequately studied in human patients or animal models and, to date, there are no effective therapies that can stop or reverse the complex and widespread inflammation-driven processes. ""To closely mimic the complex 3D cellular architecture of actual human small airways, we designed a microfluidic device that contains a fully matured human small airway epithelium with different specialized cell types exposed to air in one of its two parallel microchannels. The second channel is lined by a human vascular endothelium in which we flow medium containing white blood cells and nutrients so that the living microsystem can be maintained over weeks. We then modeled inflammatory asthma and COPD conditions by adding an asthma-inducing immune factor or by setting up the system with lung epithelial cells obtained from patients with COPD,"" said Remi Villenave, Ph.D., a former postdoctoral fellow in Ingber's group and the co-first author on the publication. In both cases, the team was not only able to observe highly disease- and cell type-specific changes but could also exacerbate them with agents simulating viral or bacterial infection.  ""This new organ-on-a-chip technology gives us a window on molecular-scale activities in the context of living human lung tissue. It also provides us with a handle to dissect contributions of specific cell types and biochemical factors to small airway diseases, including how circulating immune cells are recruited to inflammation sites and how compromised cilia function contributes to abnormal mucus clearance in the lungs of diseased patients,"" said Kambez Hajipouran Benam, Ph.D., who also is a postdoctoral fellow working with Ingber and the other co-first author of the study. Finally, the team provided proof-of-principle that the synthetic small airway-on-a-chip can be utilized as a discovery platform for disease-specific drugs and biomarkers. In collaboration with two different industrial partners -Pfizer and Merck Research Laboratories - who also helped fund the project, together with support from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), the Wyss researchers showed that two drugs targeting different key molecular components of inflammatory pathways can potently suppress pathological processes in asthma and COPD-tailored small airway chips. The Wyss scientists also identified a macrophage-recruiting factor whose levels are raised by a viral mimic in the COPD model and which can be further investigated as a potential specific biomarker for viral exacerbations of COPD. ""This novel ability to build small airway chips with cells from individual patients with diseases like COPD positions us and others now to investigate the effects of genetic variability, specific immune cell populations, pharmaceutical candidates and even pandemic viruses in an entirely new and more personalized way; one that will hopefully increase the likelihood of success of future therapeutics,"" said Ingber.

""My father, Warren Gilson, was a neurologist who made an electro-encephalograph [EEG] for his own use in the basement of the University of Wisconsin Hospital. It was better than what was commercially available, so other people in the Medical School asked, 'Can you make one for me?'"" Today, Gilson has 115 employees in Middleton and a total of 550 worldwide. Bob and his daughter, vice president of sales Molly Gilson, bridge the company's past and future; Molly's brother, Daniel Gilson, also works for the company as an engineer. Warren, Bob and Daniel Gilson all received degrees from UW-Madison. From its Middleton headquarters, Gilson makes its mark by anticipating the needs of a wide range of scientists, says Bob. ""We sell to pharmaceutical companies for drug discovery, to government customers, the CDC [Centers for Disease Control] and NIH [National Institutes of Health], manufacturers and basic researchers at universities. It depends on the product."" ""There has been an evolution of our product portfolio,"" says Molly. ""Many years ago, we deliberately moved away from medical devices that have direct contact with patients."" ""And direct contact with the FDA,"" Bob interjects. Father and daughter finish each other's sentences. They don't always agree, but seem ever agreeable. Gilson excels in several areas. One of the company's lines is liquid chromatography, instruments that detect minute chemical concentrations. A second product line performs solid-phase extraction, in which samples are absorbed onto a solid substance, then extracted in a liquid for analysis. A third field of expertise is liquid-handling robots. Medical and biological labs study an enormous range of samples and compounds and speed their work using dishes containing at least 96 wells. Gilson's robots can efficiently transfer tiny samples of liquids into those dishes. One star of Gilson's lineup is entirely manual, however: Pipetman pipettes. Pipettes are hand-held liquid dispensers found in virtually every ""wet"" biology lab, but Pipetman was almost stillborn. Warren Gilson had borrowed parts from an existing Gilson product to design the first pipette with variable output, but Bob says that when he shopped it around UW Hospital, ""no one was particularly enthused, so Father put it in a cigar box on his desk."" In the late 1960s, a UW-Madison engineering undergraduate named Eric Marteau d'Autry asked to work on the invention. Marteau d'Autry went home to France, developed the market, and for many years directed the Pipetman subsidiary Gilson still operates in France. Pipetman is ""a bread-and-butter product,"" says Molly. ""I routinely see 30-year-old pipettes that are still going strong, even though generations of undergrads have dropped them."" All of Gilson's instruments are made in Middleton, where the company hews to the philosophy that if you want it done right, do it yourself. ""We try to make instruments that make it harder to make mistakes,"" Bob says. Gilson is one of the smaller players in scientific electronics, but one advantage it has over giants like GE and Agilent is ""the mentality and the skill set to offer custom solutions where the bigger players don't want to play,"" Bob says. Being privately held is an asset, says Molly. ""Bob is good with money - he's going home today to fix his own washing machine. That has enabled us to make long term decisions, as opposed to, 'It's almost the end of the quarter; better quick discount our product to try meet the numbers.'"" Designing instruments for scientists is as fluid as science itself, Bob says. ""We turn over our product line every three to four years. The areas and methods of research change that often. Are people still looking at spider venom, or have they shifted to gut bacteria?"" The nature of Gilson's products has also changed, he adds. ""Before, we made individual modules with individual functions. Today, scientists want a total solution that does just what they need."" Figuring out what scientists need has been instrumental to Gilson's success since the beginning. As Bob remembers, when both he and Gilson Medical Electronics were young, ""on Sunday my father would go to University Hospital and eat in the cafeteria. [Biochemists] Hector DeLuca and Henry Lardy would be there, and they would all sit and talk, bounce ideas off each other."" That tight customer focus was critical, Bob says. ""Some of our most successful products, and most innovative, have sprung not from a market study, but from a scientist who was blocked and said, 'I need something that can do the work.'""","Published: December 22, 2015"

The overall occurrence of pancreatic cancer has not significantly changed since 2002, but the mortality rate has increased annually from 2002 to 2011, according to the National Cancer Institute.  Pancreatic cancer is really unique and different from other cancers,  said study co-author Ka He, chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the IU School of Public Health-Bloomington.  The five-year survival rate is really low, so that makes prevention and identifying risk factors or predictors associated with pancreatic cancer very important.  Previous studies have found that magnesium is inversely associated with the risk of diabetes, which is a risk factor of pancreatic cancer. But few studies have explored the direct association of magnesium with pancreatic cancer; of those that did, their findings were inconclusive, said Daniel Dibaba, a Ph.D. student at the School of Public Health-Bloomington, who led the IU study. Using information from the VITamins and Lifestyle study, Dibaba and the other co-authors analyzed an enormous trove of data on over 66,000 men and women, ages 50 to 76, looking at the direct association between magnesium and pancreatic cancer and whether age, gender, body mass index, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use and magnesium supplementation play a role. Of those followed, 151 participants developed pancreatic cancer. The study found that every 100-milligrams-per-day decrease in magnesium intake was associated with a 24 percent increase in the occurrence of pancreatic cancer. The study also found that the effects of magnesium on pancreatic cancer did not appear to be modified by age, gender, body mass index or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, but was limited to those taking magnesium supplements either from a multivitamin or individual supplement.  For those at a higher risk of pancreatic cancer, adding a magnesium supplement to their diet may prove beneficial in preventing this disease,  Dibaba said.  While more study is needed, the general population should strive to get the daily recommendations of magnesium through diet, such as dark, leafy greens or nuts, to prevent any risk of pancreatic cancer.

Guardant360 is a blood test that identifies multiple tumor mutations across all four types of genomic alterations: single nucleotide variations, copy number amplifications, indels, and fusions. As part of the collaboration with Mirati, Guardant360 will be used to screen NSCLC patients for certain genetic alterations to the MET pathway in order to identify the patients most likely to respond to glesatinib. Specifically, the assay will sequence for patients with certain MET mutations and MET gene amplification. This plasma-based assay offers a less invasive, and potentially safer, approach to assess tumor genetics by avoiding the risks associated with tumor biopsies. This is an important factor for lung cancer patients for whom repeated tumor biopsies are often not possible. The ability to perform multiple ctDNA blood assays will also facilitate the identification of key resistance mechanisms. The collaboration will use Guardant360 in Mirati's Phase 2 clinical trial of glesatinib in patients with NSCLC. In a separate press release today, Mirati announced the initiation of the Phase 2 trial. If successful, the collaboration could result in a regulatory submission and approval of the Guardant360 platform as a companion diagnostic for glesatinib. ""Guardant360 is particularly useful for cancers driven by evolved mutations like MET amplifications. The non-invasive assay allows oncologists to quickly and easily monitor patients and their response to targeted therapies,"" said Guardant Health co-founder and CEO, Helmy Eltoukhy. ""Mirati is a pioneer in the field of targeted therapeutics and the company is known for being an innovator. Today's collaboration will allow us to leverage our unique technology to provide more patients access to targeted trials, and potentially accelerate clinical studies, making cancer a more manageable disease."" ""Identifying patients with MET mutations or MET gene amplification is the key to our patient selection strategy. Clinical data has shown that these are the patients most likely to respond to glesatinib,"" said Charles M. Baum, M.D., Ph.D., president and CEO, Mirati. ""Collaborating with Guardant on a ctDNA assay means that we expect to be able to detect these mutations in a blood sample. This will enable the more than 30% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, who have insufficient tumor tissue for biopsy, to be screened for genetic alterations that may be driving their cancer and to seek treatment that could lead to improved outcomes.","Published: December 22, 2015"

Upon completion, RestorGenex will issue to Diffusion equity holders shares of RestorGenex common stock such that the current equity holders of Diffusion will own approximately 83% of the combined company s outstanding shares and current stockholders of RestorGenex will own approximately 17%.  These percentage ownerships are subject to potential adjustment depending upon the amount of net cash of RestorGenex at closing as provided in the merger agreement. In addition, immediately prior to the merger, RestorGenex plans to distribute to its then current stockholders contingent value rights (CVRs) providing payment rights with respect to the first $50 million of net proceeds arising from a future sale, transfer, license or similar transaction involving RestorGenex s RES-440 product candidate for the treatment of acne vulgaris.  Any current RestorGenex option or warrant holder would, at the time of exercise, be entitled to receive one CVR for each share of RestorGenex common stock issued upon exercise of the option and warrant, which would entitle the holder to a pro rata portion of any CVR payments made. The current directors and executive officers of RestorGenex will resign from their positions with RestorGenex upon the closing of the proposed merger, and the combined company will be under the leadership of Diffusion's current executive management team with David G. Kalergis serving as chief executive officer.  The board of directors of the combined company is expected to consist of six members, all of whom will be designated by Diffusion.  The corporate headquarters of the combined company will be located in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Following completion of the merger, the combined company will be renamed Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The proposed merger will create a clinical-stage company with a diversified development portfolio of product candidates addressing novel targets in oncology, including several orphan indications.  Initially, the combined company will be focused on the development of Diffusion s lead molecule trans sodium crocetinate (TSC).  TSC has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and expects to enter a Phase III study in newly diagnosed GBM patients in 2016.  Future development of TSC includes other orphan indications such as pancreatic cancer and brain metastases.  TSC s novel mechanism of action enhances the diffusion of oxygen to cancerous tumors, improving the effects of cancer treatments such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Stephen M. Simes, RestorGenex s chief executive officer, stated,  We have chosen to combine with Diffusion in order to add a clinical-ready product to our oncology portfolio. Specifically the key Diffusion product is scheduled to enter a Phase III clinical trial in 2016 thereby accelerating our product development dramatically.  The board and management of RestorGenex conducted an extensive process and thorough review of strategic alternatives and we believe the proposed merger provides an attractive opportunity for value appreciation for RestorGenex s stockholders.  David Kalergis, chief executive officer of Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, added,  We expect to be positioned to move forward with a pivotal Phase III trial of TSC in newly diagnosed GBM patients, with plans to begin enrollment in 2016.  We also are planning to commence a Phase II/III trial in pancreatic cancer in 2016 with a Phase II/III study in brain metastases to follow.  The merger between Diffusion and RestorGenex will provide improved access to the capital markets, in order to obtain the resources necessary to accelerate development of TSC in multiple clinical programs and continue to build an oncology-focused company.  The transaction has been approved unanimously by the boards of directors of both companies. The proposed merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of Diffusion s members.  Raymond James & Associates, Inc. is acting as exclusive financial advisor to RestorGenex and Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly LLP is acting as legal counsel for RestorGenex.

Under the terms agreed in the two transactions, ViiV Healthcare will acquire:   Late stage assets, including fostemsavir (BMS-663068), an attachment inhibitor, currently in phase III development for heavily treatment experienced patients. Fostemsavir has received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA and is expected to be filed for regulatory approval in 2018. The second late stage asset is a maturation inhibitor (BMS-955176), currently in phase IIb development for both treatment-naive and treatment experienced patients. A back-up maturation inhibitor candidate (BMS-986173) is also included in the purchase.   Assets in preclinical and discovery phases of development including a novel biologic (BMS-986197) with a triple mechanism of action, a further maturation inhibitor, an allosteric integrase inhibitor and a capsid inhibitor. A number of Bristol-Myers Squibb drug discovery employees will also be offered the opportunity to transfer to ViiV Healthcare. These potential therapies have novel modes of action and would offer significant new treatment options to patients with HIV. In addition to being developed as standalone treatment options, these new assets complement ViiV Healthcare s existing portfolio and therefore offer multiple opportunities for development as combination therapies. The late-stage asset purchase comprises an upfront payment of $317 million, followed by development and first commercial sale milestones of up to $518M, and tiered royalties on sales. The purchase of preclinical and discovery stage research assets comprises an upfront payment of $33 million, followed by development and first commercial sales milestones of up to $587M, and further consideration contingent on future sales performance. David Redfern, Chief Strategy Officer at GSK and Chairman of ViiV Healthcare, said:  These acquisitions strengthen our leadership and innovation in HIV, one of our core areas of scientific research at GSK. The addition of two potential first-in-class late-stage treatments and several promising early clinical development programmes strengthens ViiV Healthcare s pipeline and provides us with further new opportunities for growth.  The two transactions are anticipated to complete independently during the first half of 2016, subject to necessary approvals, anti-trust and regulatory clearances.  GSK has been a leader in research and development of HIV since the 1980s, with the development of the world s first breakthrough medicine for HIV patients, Retrovir (zidovudine). Development of new treatment options has continued, with Tivicay (dolutegravir) and Triumeq (dolutegravir/ abacavir/lamivudine), the most recent successful innovation. Research programmes are ongoing to develop new treatments and improve drug regimens, including the investigational long-acting integrase inhibitor, cabotegravir. Established in 2009, ViiV Healthcare is a specialist global HIV company, majority owned by GSK, with Pfizer and Shionogi as other shareholders.","Published: December 22, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/hit-parade-196948,Hit Parade Researchers are generating a list of compounds that may lead to a trio of new therapeutics  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Harvard Medical School researchers are generating a list of compounds that have the potential to become new classes of antibiotics, antivirulents, and even blood thinners. The work, led by Jonathan Beckwith, the HMS American Cancer Society Professor of Microbiology and Immunobiology Emeritus, builds on basic research discoveries made in his lab in the 1990s. In 2009, Beckwith s lab won a Harvard Catalyst pilot grant to help turn this fundamental research into new medicines. Since then, the team has fulfilled the Harvard Catalyst mission and then some. Not only did the grant help them turn their basic discoveries into a high-throughput drug screening machine, it also helped them secure the funding and connections needed to use it to search for new drug leads. A screen to find drug candidates for one disease is an accomplishment, but the team developed a screening system that works like a multi-tiered filter that teases out leads for three distinct medical applications, each in need of new therapies: gram-negative bacterial infections, tuberculosis infections and blood clotting disorders.  It s a virtually perfect screen,  says Dana Boyd, an HMS lecturer on microbiology and immunobiology and a research scientist in the Beckwith lab.  It tells us instantly and precisely if we have a hit against one of our three targets.  DsbB Basics The story began in 1990 when Beckwith and members of his lab discovered two genes for enzymes that regulate a biochemical process in bacteria called disulfide bond formation. Disulfide bonds help stabilize bacterial proteins, particularly the toxins that bacterial cells send out to infect other cells. Neither enzyme is essential for E. coli to grow, so for a while the project took a backseat to others. Later, Beckwith s group wondered if these enzymes, DsbA and DsbB, might be common across many types of bacteria, as disulfide bonds are. By then, about 400 bacterial genomes had been sequenced, so Boyd and Rachel Dutton, then a graduate student in the lab, developed a bioinformatics tool to search for similar enzymes in other bacterial species. Dutton is now principal investigator in the Division of Biological Sciences at the University of California, San Diego. They found that the system was widespread, but in some types of bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, they found only DsbA. Instead of DsbB, they found a different, unknown gene. The only clue they had was a note another scientist had left in the genome:  VKOR.  They learned that the Mycobacterium VKOR protein is, genetically speaking, closely related to the human VKOR protein, which is involved in blood coagulation. Human VKOR is the target of the anticoagulant drug warfarin (Coumadin), a drug used to thin the blood of patients at risk of clots. Though warfarin is prescribed widely, it requires close monitoring. Foods such as leafy greens can throw off the dosing, putting patients at risk of clotting if the dose is too low, or bleeding if the dose is too high.  We thought that if we could find new compounds that act against VKOR, we could potentially find inhibitors that work in a different way, without the same issues with a patient s diet,  says Beckwith. The team had also learned that interrupting Mycobacterium VKOR inhibits its growth, making it a plausible target for new antibiotics. In some parts of the world, tuberculosis has become so resistant to antibiotics that it is almost untreatable. Schemes for Screens To find leads for new antibiotics against tuberculosis and anticoagulants, Beckwith s team set out to build a screening system that would detect compounds that interfere with VKOR. To support this effort, they were awarded the Harvard Catalyst pilot grant in 2009, which was later followed by a Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator grant from Harvard University. Even though bacterial VKOR and DsbB don t share common genetic roots, Beckwith s team found that VKOR can replace DsbB in E. coli and do its job of promoting disulfide bond formation. The team built a screening system that uses different strains of E. coli, each with different disulfide bond-forming enzymes, to detect inhibitors of the different enzymes. The original screen detected DsbB and bacterial VKOR inhibitors. More recently the team expanded the screen to include rat VKOR, which closely resembles the human enzyme.  We re interested in compounds that inhibit specific enzymes,  said Cristina Landeta, a postdoc in the Beckwith lab and first author on a February 2015 Nature Chemical Biology paper describing the screening system.  You don t want to develop an antibiotic that is also a blood thinner,  she said. In May 2014, the team connected with Hoffman-La Roche, a pharmaceutical company interested in using their screening tool to find ways to block DsbB to treat Pseudomonas infections. Pseudomonas infections are common among hospitalized patients and are becoming increasingly resistant to existing antibiotics. In Pseudomonas and other gram-negative bacteria, blocking DsbB is not lethal. Instead of looking for compounds that kill the bacteria antibiotics the team is looking for compounds that undermine its infectious capacity antivirulents. In this case, an antivirulent would block the disulfide bonds that make bacterial toxins and other virulence factors stable.  The disabled colony of bacteria could then be overcome by the immune system, or possibly by another drug,  said Boyd. The team has screened a library of 80,000 potential drug compounds from Roche and is screening a library of 650,000 compounds from the Institute of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard. So far, they ve found two compounds that may be viable Pseudomonas antivirulents. Roche has ruled out one, but the team is testing both against Pseudomonas infections in mice. They have also identified 30 compounds that act against VKOR and could become antibiotics for tuberculosis or anticoagulants. As screening continues, the hits keep coming.  We have to start giving them names,  said Landeta.","Published: December 22, 2015"

The team modified a simple microfluidic channel with an array of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes   rolled lattices of carbon atoms that resemble tiny tubes of chicken wire. The researchers had previously devised a method for standing carbon nanotubes on their ends, like trees in a forest. With this method, they created a three-dimensional array of permeable carbon nanotubes within a microfluidic device, through which fluid can flow. Now the researchers have given the nanotube array the ability to trap certain particles. To do this, the team coated the array, layer by layer, with polymers of alternating electric charge.  You can think of each nanotube in the forest as being concentrically coated with different layers of polymer,  says Brian Wardle, professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT.  If you drew it in cross-section, it would be like rings on a tree.  Depending on the number of layers deposited, the researchers can create thicker or thinner nanotubes and thereby tailor the porosity of the forest to capture larger or smaller particles of interest.  The nanotubes  polymer coating may also be chemically manipulated to bind specific bioparticles flowing through the forest. To test this idea, the researchers applied an established technique to treat the surface of the nanotubes with antibodies that bind to prostate specific antigen (PSA), a common experimental target. The polymer-coated arrays captured 40 percent more antigens, compared with arrays lacking the polymer coating. Wardle says the combination of carbon nanotubes and multilayer coatings may help finely tune microfluidic devices to capture extremely small and rare particles, such as certain viruses and proteins.  There are smaller bioparticles that contain very rich amounts of information that we don t currently have the ability to access in point-of-care [medical testing] devices like microfluidic chips,  says Wardle, who is a co-author on the paper.  Carbon nanotube arrays could actually be a platform that could target that size of bioparticle.  The paper s lead author is Allison Yost, a former graduate student who is currently an engineer at Accion Systems. Others on the paper include graduate student Setareh Shahsavari; postdoc Roberta Polak; School of Engineering Professor of Teaching Innovation Gareth McKinley; professor of materials science and engineering Michael Rubner, and Raymond A. And Helen E. St. Laurent Professor of Chemical Engineering Robert Cohen. A porous forest Carbon nanotubes have been a subject of intense scientific study, as they possess exceptional electrical, mechanical, and optical properties. While their use in microfluidics has not been well explored, Wardle says carbon nanotubes are an ideal platform because their properties may be manipulated to attract certain nanometer-sized molecules. Additionally, carbon nanotubes are 99 percent porous, meaning a nanotube is about 1 percent carbon and 99 percent air.  Which is what you need,  Wardle says.  You need to flow quantities of fluid through this material to shed all the millions of particles you don t want to find and grab the one you do want to find.  What s more, Wardle says, a three-dimensional forest of carbon nanotubes would provide much more surface area on which target molecules may interact, compared with the two-dimensional surfaces in conventional microfluidics.  The capture efficiency would scale with surface area,  Wardle notes. A versatile array The team integrated a three-dimensional array of carbon nanotubes into a microfluidic device by using chemical vapor deposition and photolithography to grow and pattern carbon nanotubes onto silicon wafers. They then grouped the nanotubes into a cylinder-shaped forest, measuring about 50 micrometers tall and 1 millimeter wide, and centered the array within a 3 millimeter-wide, 7-millimeter long microfluidic channel. The researchers coated the nanotubes in successive layers of alternately charged polymer solutions in order to create distinct, binding layers around each nanotube. To do so, they flowed each solution through the channel and found they were able to create a more uniform coating with a gap between the top of the nanotube forest and the roof of the channel. Such a gap allowed solutions to flow over, then down into the forest, coating each individual nanotube. In the absence of a gap, solutions simply flowed around the forest, coating only the outer nanotubes. After coating the nanotube array in layers of polymer solution, the researchers demonstrated that the array could be primed to detect a given molecule, by treating it with antibodies that typically bind to prostate specific antigen (PSA). They pumped in a solution containing small amounts of PSA and found that the array captured the antigen effectively, throughout the forest, rather than just on the outer surface of a typical microfluidic element. Wardle says that the nanotube array is extremely versatile, as the carbon nanotubes may be manipulated mechanically, electrically, and optically, while the polymer coatings may be chemically altered to capture a wide range of particles. He says an immediate target may be biomarkers called exosomes, which are less than 100 nanometers wide and can be important signals of a disease s progression.  Science is really picking up on how much information these particles contain, and they re sort of everywhere, but really hard to find, even with large-scale equipment,  Wardle says.  This type of device actually has all the characteristics and functionality that would allow you to go after bioparticles like exosomes and things that really truly are nanometer scale.  This research was funded, in part, by the National Science Foundation.","Published: December 22, 2015"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/identifying-drug-resistance-traits-197585,Identifying Drug Resistance Traits Scientists have developed an easy to use computer program that can quickly analyse bacterial DNA from a patient s infection and predict which antibiotics will work  and which will fail due to drug resistance   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The software is currently being trialled in three UK hospitals to see whether it could help speed up diagnosis of drug-resistant infections and enable doctors to better target the prescription of antibiotics. The Mykrobe Predictor software, developed by Dr Zamin Iqbal and colleagues at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, runs on a standard laptop or tablet without the need for any specialist expertise. The program can analyse the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under 3 minutes, once a bacterial sample has been cultured and its DNA sequenced. A study on more than 4,500 retrospective patient samples, published today in Nature Communications, shows that Mykrobe Predictor accurately detects antibiotic resistance in two life-threatening bacterial infections: Staphylococcus aureus (one form of which causes MRSA) and tuberculosis (TB). The software is now being evaluated in hospitals in Oxford, Brighton and Leeds in a project led by Professor Derrick Crook, which in collaboration with parallel programmes at UCL and Cambridge University aims to develop whole genome sequencing as a routine tool for the diagnosis and control of infections within the NHS. The programme is funded by the Department of Health and the Wellcome Trust through the joint Health Innovation Challenge Fund. Drug-resistant infections pose a major threat to global health and could in future mean that serious and life-threatening infections become impossible to treat. The problem develops through natural selection. Like other species, bacteria are constantly evolving through subtle changes in their DNA. Some of these changes make them resistant to certain drugs, meaning they are more likely to survive and pass on their resistant traits to other bacteria.  One of the best ways to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria is to make sure that patients with an infection are treated quickly with the right type of antibiotic. But to find out which particular strain of bacteria is causing a patient's infection and which drugs it is resistant to, doctors must carry out drug susceptibility testing, where different antibiotics are applied to the bacteria in a petri dish to see whether they kill it. This process can take days, or even months for slow-growing infections like TB.   Scientists believe they could obtain the same information much faster by looking directly at the DNA sequence of the bacterium for mutations that are known to cause resistance. However, the interpretation of genetic information often requires a large amount of computing power and the expertise of specialist bioinformaticians. Mykrobe Predictor streamlines this process by automating genome analysis, cross-checking the bacterium's DNA sequence with previous strains to look for resistance-causing mutations and presenting information about the bug in an easy-to-understand format.  In this study, the software was able to detect resistance to the five first-line antibiotics in over 99% of Staphylococcus aureus cases, matching the performance of traditional drug sensitivity testing. For TB, where the genetic basis for drug resistance is less well understood, Mykrobe Predictor still matched the performance of current DNA tests (which look at snippets of DNA, but not the whole sequence), detecting 82.6% of resistant infections around 5-16 weeks faster than traditional drug susceptibility testing. However unlike standard 'snippet-based' DNA tests, Mykrobe Predictor can be rapidly updated with a simple software upgrade that allows researchers to detect new resistance mutations as they evolve. A further advantage of Mykrobe is that it can identify infections where a patient's body contains a mixture of both drug-resistant and drug-susceptible bacteria. In this study, the ability to distinguish between these bacterial 'sub-populations' gave Mykrobe an advantage over conventional testing in detecting resistance to second-line TB drugs. This is important for diagnosing infections such as 'extensively drug-resistant TB' (XDR-TB), which is resistant to at least four of the core TB drugs and is considered a global threat to public health by the World Health Organisation.  Dr Zamin Iqbal, from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at the University of Oxford, senior author of the paper, said: 'One of the barriers to making whole genome sequencing a routine part of NHS care is the need for powerful computers and expertise to interpret the masses of complex data. Our software manages data quickly and presents the results to doctors and nurses in ways that are easy to understand, so they can instinctively use them to make better treatment decisions.' Co-author Professor Derrick Crook, a Consultant Microbiologist at the John Radcliffe Hospital and Director of the National Infection Service, Public Health England, said: 'Genome sequencing has the potential to transform the way we diagnose and treat bacterial infections in NHS hospitals, but one of the main challenges is developing the right tools to enable us to unlock this information quickly and affordably. Our ultimate goal is to be able to provide complete information on a pathogen within 24 hours of culture, linking this information to a national surveillance database to enable more timely and better targeted patient treatment.' Dr Stephen Caddick, Director of Innovations at the Wellcome Trust, added: 'Drug-resistant infections pose a major threat to global public health. Antibiotics that were once lifesavers are in danger of becoming worthless, and within our lifetime we could see minor infections returning as a major public health concern. We urgently need new diagnostic strategies that allow us to better target antibiotic use, and thereby safeguard the effectiveness of our existing antibiotics, and any new drugs that are developed in future.'","Published: December 22, 2015"

A new cell culture technique allows the processes of tumour growth to be studied directly and in real time, without the need for complex experiments using live animals. The researchers at Friedrich-Alexander-Universit t Erlangen-N rnberg (FAU) who developed the technique looked specifically at brain tumours. The team led by neuroscientist PD Dr. Nicolai Savaskan developed a 3D cell culture technique called the Vascular Organotypic Glioma Impact Model (VOGIM) which allows the formation of tumour blood vessels and their interaction with immune cells to be observed over a period of several days in an organotypic context. This new method will allow new medications and therapies to be analysed directly, and enable side effects to be identified more quickly and efficiently than when using conventional cell culture techniques. VOGIM also allows the amount of animal testing required in vascular studies to be reduced. The results of the study by researchers at the Department of Neurosurgery at Universit tsklinikum Erlangen have now been published.'VOGIM is a complex technique that allows tumours to be studied in real time and under clinically realistic conditions - without the need for live animal testing,' says Dr. Nicolai Savaskan, who led the study. In the technique tissue samples from rodent brains are infected with tumour cells expressing fluorescent reporter genes. The growth of tumour cells and blood vessels, cell death, and the influence of medications on these developments are observed in the experiment. 'Even though VOGIM still requires some animal testing, it is a great technique. It can be used to test the effectiveness of new medications and molecules against gliomas - tumours of the central nervous system - relatively quickly and in a way that is reproducible,' Dr. Savaskan explains. 'We can also use it to study the side effects of almost any medication.' The next goal of the Erlangen-based researchers is to test new hybrid molecules from the plant and animal kingdom in this system in order to quickly develop new treatment strategies. Brain tumours have destructive effects on the surrounding cells and blood vessels. Accumulations of serum around the tumour are a common symptom. These cause swelling in the brain and increase pressure inside the skull to dangerous levels. In the worst case, the swelling can cause pressure on the respiratory centre above the cervical spine, quickly leading to suffocation. The cause of this swelling in the brain are pathological changes to the tumour blood vessels and disruption of the immune response to the brain tumour. The accumulations of serum are caused by the tumour cells which damage surrounding tissue and cells, making them more permeable. The new VOGIM technique allows the tumour blood vessels and the immune system of the brain to be observed closely and the influence of new therapeutics to be studied in this context.","Published: December 22, 2015"

Any current RestorGenex option or warrant holder would, at the time of exercise, be entitled to receive one CVR for each share of RestorGenex common stock issued upon exercise of the option and warrant, which would entitle the holder to a pro rata portion of any CVR payments made. The current directors and executive officers of RestorGenex will resign from their positions with RestorGenex upon the closing of the proposed merger, and the combined company will be under the leadership of Diffusion's current executive management team with David G. Kalergis serving as chief executive officer. The board of directors of the combined company is expected to consist of six members, all of whom will be designated by Diffusion. The corporate headquarters of the combined company will be located in Charlottesville, Virginia. Following completion of the merger, the combined company will be renamed Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The proposed merger will create a clinical-stage company with a diversified development portfolio of product candidates addressing novel targets in oncology, including several orphan indications. Initially, the combined company will be focused on the development of Diffusion s lead molecule trans sodium crocetinate (TSC). TSC has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and expects to enter a Phase III study in newly diagnosed GBM patients in 2016. Future development of TSC includes other orphan indications such as pancreatic cancer and brain metastases. TSC s novel mechanism of action enhances the diffusion of oxygen to cancerous tumors, improving the effects of cancer treatments such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Stephen M. Simes, RestorGenex s chief executive officer, stated,  We have chosen to combine with Diffusion in order to add a clinical-ready product to our oncology portfolio. Specifically the key Diffusion product is scheduled to enter a Phase III clinical trial in 2016 thereby accelerating our product development dramatically. The board and management of RestorGenex conducted an extensive process and thorough review of strategic alternatives and we believe the proposed merger provides an attractive opportunity for value appreciation for RestorGenex s stockholders.  David Kalergis, chief executive officer of Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, added,  We expect to be positioned to move forward with a pivotal Phase III trial of TSC in newly diagnosed GBM patients, with plans to begin enrollment in 2016. We also are planning to commence a Phase II/III trial in pancreatic cancer in 2016 with a Phase II/III study in brain metastases to follow. The merger between Diffusion and RestorGenex will provide improved access to the capital markets, in order to obtain the resources necessary to accelerate development of TSC in multiple clinical programs and continue to build an oncology-focused company.  The transaction has been approved unanimously by the boards of directors of both companies. The proposed merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of Diffusion s members.

Supported by the National Eye Institute (NEI), part of the National Institutes of Health, the findings may help improve our understanding of the biological processes that lead to AMD and identify new therapeutic targets for potential drug development. AMD is a progressive disease that causes the death of the retinal photoreceptors, the light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye. The most severe damage occurs in the macula, a small area of the retina that is needed for sharp, central vision necessary for reading, driving and other daily tasks. There are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for the more common form of advanced AMD, called geographic atrophy or ""dry"" AMD. While therapies for the other advanced form, neovascular or ""wet"" AMD, can successfully halt the growth of abnormal, leaky blood vessels in the eye, the therapies do not cure the condition, nor do they work for everyone. AMD is caused by a combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle risk factors. For example, smoking increases the risk of AMD, while eating leafy greens and fish, such as salmon, halibut, and tuna, may reduce the risk. Up to this point, researchers had identified 21 regions of the genome -- called loci -- that influence the risk of AMD. The new research, published in Nature Genetics, brings the number up to 34 loci. The International AMD Genomics Consortium, which includes 26 centers worldwide, collected and analyzed the genetic data from 43,566 people of predominantly European ancestry to systematically identify common and rare variations in genetic coding-called variants-associated with AMD. Common variants generally have an indirect association with a disease. Rare variants, by contrast, are more likely to alter protein expression or function and therefore have a direct or causal association with a disease. Rare variants were defined as those found in less than 1 percent of the study population. The study included about 23,000 participants with AMD and 20,000 without it. The researchers analyzed DNA samples from both groups, surveying most of the genome, but also focusing in on distinct loci already known or suspected to be associated with AMD. Next, they compared the participants' DNA to a reference dataset called the 1000 Genomes project, yielding more than 12 million genetic variants of potential interest. Finally, they went back to the participants' DNA samples, looking at all 12 million variants, to see if any were found more or less often in people with AMD than those without it. ""The investigation is akin to looking at a Google map of the United States and attempting to pinpoint several leaders and satellite operations in a crime syndicate,"" said a co-leader of the study, Anand Swaroop, Ph.D., chief of NEI's Neurobiology-Neurodegeneration and Repair Laboratory. ""It's possible to find the key players by zooming in and seeing specific regions in rich detail, but first you have to know where to look. Pooling the genetic information from such a large population is what allowed us to look across the genome for possible culprits in AMD, even very small, very rare ones."" The researchers have now discovered a total of 52 genetic variants that are associated with AMD. These variants are located among 34 loci, 16 of which had not been previously associated with AMD. ""If you think of these loci as points on our Google map in our search for the crime syndicate members, or the genetic causes of AMD, in some cases they are as big as a zip code, but in other cases they pinpoint an area as narrowly defined as a few houses within a neighborhood subdivision,"" Dr. Swaroop said. ""These variants provide a foundation for genetic studies of AMD going forward,"" said one of the senior authors, Jonathan L. Haines, Ph.D., of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. ""The next step is to investigate what the variants are doing to the genes and how they affect gene function. Do they turn them on or off? Do they interact with other genes spurring a series of events along a pathway that leads to AMD?"" The study findings also bolster associations between AMD and two genes, CFH and TIMP3, which had each previously been linked to AMD. CFH was the very first disease-linked gene to be found through a genome-wide association study. TIMP3 had earlier been linked to Sorsby's fundus dystrophy, a rare disease that is similar to AMD clinically, but that tends to affect people before the age of 45. For the first time the researchers also identified a variant specific to the neovascular form of AMD, which may point to reasons why therapy for this form of AMD is effective for some people but not everyone. Additionally, 10 of the variants point to genes involved in maintaining the extracellular matrix, the nonliving material amongst cells that provides structural support and nutrients. Researchers have theorized that abnormalities of the extracellular matrix occur in people with a subtype of AMD that develops without early-stage signs, or that quickly worsens before such signs are detected. If confirmed, a connection between AMD and these extracellular matrix genes may allow for predictive genetic tests and more effective therapies for people with this type of AMD. ""Even with the pooling of genetic information from such a large population, the variants identified by the international consortium still cannot account for all of the heritability of AMD,"" said Grace L. Shen, Ph.D., a group leader and director of the retinal diseases program at NEI. ""We are, however, on track for discovering important variant genes that may play a role in AMD heritability.""","Published: December 22, 2015"

The study is published in Nature Medicine. ""We have shown for the first time that it's possible to use a drug to activate this disposal system in neurons and effectively slow down disease,"" said study leader Karen E Duff, PhD, professor of pathology and cell biology (in psychiatry and in the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain) at CUMC and at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. ""This has the potential to open up new avenues of treatment for Alzheimer's and many other neurodegenerative diseases."" The drug used was rolipram, which causes nausea and thus is not a good drug for use in humans, but similar drugs do not incur nausea as a side effect and could go into clinical trials very quickly. To remain healthy, brain cells must continually clear out old, worn, or damaged proteins, a task performed by a small molecular cylinder called the proteasome. The proteasome acts as a kind of garbage disposal, grinding up the old proteins so they can be recycled into new ones. In neurodegenerative diseases, proteins tagged for destruction accumulate in the brain's neurons, suggesting that the cell's proteasomes are impaired. Using a mouse model of neurodegeneration, the researchers first discovered that tau a toxic protein that accumulates in Alzheimer's and other brain degenerative diseases sticks to the proteasome and slows down the protein disposal process. Administering rolipram activated the proteasome and restored protein disposal to normal levels. The drug also improved the memory of diseased mice to levels seen in healthy mice. Rolipram has been tested before in mice and was shown to improve memory, but the mechanism for how this occurred was unclear. The new research shows that by inhibiting of the PDE-4 enzyme, rolipram produces a physical change in the proteasome that increases its activity. ""We still don't know exactly where the activation is happening, but what's new is that we can modify the proteasome to increase its activity. There could be many other ways to do this,"" said the study's first author, Natura Myeku, PhD, an associate research scientist in pathology and cell biology at CUMC. Drugs that target proteasomes in this way should work for any disease caused by the accumulation of abnormal proteins, including Alzheimer's, Huntington's, Parkinson's and frontotemperoral dementia. ""Treatments that speed up these cell disposal mechanisms should, in theory, only degrade abnormal proteins. We don't need to know what the toxic form of the protein is,"" Dr Duff said. ""In Alzheimer's disease, there are at least four different types: amyloid, tau, alpha-synuclein, and TDP43. A well-functioning proteasome can clear out everything at once."" ""This exciting research from Dr. Duff's team advances our basic understanding of the proteasome system, provides a way to repair the system when it breaks, and alleviates symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders,"" said Rod Corriveau, PhD, program director at the National Institute of Health's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which provided funding for the study.

While researching new methods of reconstructing 3D neural tissue and neural pathways in the brain and spinal cord, Dr. Richard McMurtrey devised new mathematical approaches for understanding the concentration of nutrients within the 3D tissue constructs and how this could affect tissue growth. Stem cells have very unique behaviors and responses to specific concentrations of many molecular factors, meaning that it is important to understand the complex dynamics of nutrient signaling, diffusion, and metabolism in 3D tissues. Many 3D tissues have been constructed with the hope of replicating ""mini-organs"" from a patient's own stem cells, including ""mini-brains"" or cerebral organoids that can be used to study neurological diseases or which may one day be directly transplanted into damaged tissues of a patient. The ability to guide and direct stem cell development and function to the desired effect in the organoids is therefore an essential aspect of this research. ""I first stumbled upon these ideas when trying to figure out how to obtain exact nutrient concentrations in some 3D tissues I had designed that were composed of neural stem cells,"" said Dr. McMurtrey. ""The mathematics involved has always fascinated me, but I was surprised that answering my questions was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be. I felt like I kept going down a rabbit hole trying to find solutions, and eventually I figured out the mathematics that could answer my questions. I think these ideas really help us understand the role of diffusion in brain function and neural development better than ever before. But of course there is also much more to still learn."" During human development, stem cells near the center of the developing brain will migrate outwardly and form the neurons in the cortex on the outer rim of the brain, the region where thoughts are formed and processed. The mathematical work described in the paper describes growth limitations imposed by diffusion and metabolism and also suggests an underlying physical basis for the phenomenon of neural migration to a dense external cortical layer. Once the neurons are programmed to migrate to the outer surface, the cortex can then become more convoluted or wrinkled to create more extensive neural networks. One of the unique aspects of these physical models involved implementing features of cell metabolism in the equations, and the work enables any researcher to adapt the models to their specific cell types as well as to their specific tissue shape and architecture. Even though the mathematics involved in deriving these equations is complex, one of the advantages of these models is that researchers only need to have a working knowledge of algebra to use them. The modeling of many physical phenomena generally requires specialized skills in computational programming, but this work sought to provide what are called analytic or explicit solutions, which simply allow the parameters to be inserted into the formulas and the solutions to be determined. McMurtrey's research currently focuses on reconstructing brain and spinal cord structures and pathways using synthetic 3-dimensional neural tissue made with stem cells, biomaterials, and nanotechnology, and he hopes to use the models to design enhanced artificial tissue implants that could be used clinically to repair sites of tissue damage. These engineered tissue constructs can also be used for studying models of development and disease under controlled conditions or for conditioning cells to enhance survival after implantation into the body. ""Many physicists and mathematicians have studied medicine, like Fick or Helmholtz, or wondered in awe at the complex function of the brain, like Einstein or Feynman,"" Dr. McMurtrey stated. ""I wanted to be a physicist growing up, but I happened to end up in medicine, though I still marvel at the underlying physics that can both govern a vast universe and yet also make all neural function possible. I think we will see that, just as with all other systems in the universe, we cannot fully understand a system as complex as the brain until we understand the mathematics governing many fundamental components of that system, whether that is the complexity of neural networks, the dynamics of cell signaling and gene expression networks, the Hodgkin-Huxley-like electrical activity of neuronal membranes, or the biomechanics of developing tissues.

At its worst, ketamine, the party drug ""Special K,"" is addictive and may send recreational users into hallucinations and delusions. Some have experienced disorientation that they call the ""K-hole."" Because of the potential for misuse and addiction, explained researcher Daniel Lodge, PhD, of The University of Texas (UT) Health Science Center at San Antonio, ""You have a novel, highly effective treatment for depression, but you can't give it to people to take at home or on a routine basis."" Antidepressants usually take at least two weeks to show any effect in the patients they help, and not all patients benefit. If a drug were fast-acting and provided sustained relief from depression, the risk of suicide among patients would be reduced. SEE ALSO: Ketamine Can Be A Wonder Drug for ER Patients And Their Physicians The problem with ketamine is that the drug acts on receptors located throughout the brain, making it difficult to control its effects. Using state-of-the-art research techniques in rats, Lodge and colleagues from the Health Science Center's Department of Pharmacology identified a brain circuit that brings about the beneficial effects of ketamine. The circuit sends signals between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. The researchers found that activating the circuit in rats causes antidepressant-like effects similar to those caused by ketamine, whereas preventing activation of the circuit eliminates the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine.

The study shows that a specific human antibody labelled with the alpha emitter bismuth-213 can penetrate the blood brain barrier and selectively target and destroy HIV-infected cells while sparing non-infected healthy cells. These findings may open new options for the treatment of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders. The in vitro study that was at the basis of the scientific article was conducted in a consortium of various research organizations, including Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and the JRC. It has shown that the novel alpha emitter radioactive drug can penetrate a simulated human blood brain barrier without causing damage to it and selectively bind and kill HIV-infected cells residing in the central nervous system. The approach is based on the unique physical properties of alpha radiation, in particular its high energy and short path length in human tissue, to selectively address and destroy diseased cells while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. Combined therapy against the virus (cART) allows HIV-positive patients to live much longer.  There are however reservoirs within the body where the virus persists and continues to cause damage. In particular the treatment of infections of the central nervous system poses a particular challenge as the blood brain barrier limits many cART drugs from reaching effective levels in the brain.

Scientists at Ludwig Maximilians Universitat (LMU) Munich and Harvard University have now put forward a mathematical theory that explains key grid-cell features and how these give rise to a neural metric for space. One year ago, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to the discoverers of the mammalian  GPS system  for spatial navigation. Measuring neural activity in cortex, these researchers had found that some cells represent space in a highly surprising manner: As the animal moves through its environment, distinct sets of cells are sequentially activated. Each individual  grid cell  responds to multiple positions in space that form a virtual hexagonal lattice tessellating the environment. This strikingly periodic and beautiful spatial pattern has caught the imagination of experimental and theoretical neuroscientists alike, and has been proposed to constitute the brain s metric for space. Theoretical neuroscientists at LMU Munich and the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience in Munich, and at Harvard University, have now put forward a comprehensive mathematical theory that explains many features of grid cell activity that had remained mysterious, and makes specific predictions that can be tested in neurophysiological and behavioral experiments. The framework proposed by Martin Stemmler (LMU), Alexander Mathis (Harvard) and Andreas V.M. Herz (Professor of Computational Neuroscience at LMU) exploits and extends a computational principle well known from sensory systems and the brain s motor cortex population-vector decoding: physical quantities such as the angle of a visual stimulus or the direction of a movement can be easily read out from the activity of a population of neurons with different tuning properties if the neurons  activities are combined in a particular, vector-like manner. However, the theory proposed by Stemmler and colleagues goes far beyond these previous schemes in that the decoded quantity the animal s position is not a circular variable.  Animals move on two-dimensional surfaces or in three-dimensional spaces, so their position is not a one-dimensional variable either. In addition, population-vector averages across different grid scales need to be combined,  explains Andreas Herz. Yet, the overall conceptual similarity of the new scheme to conventional population-vector decoding suggests that there exist overarching computational principles that operate throughout the brain.  This raises hopes that, in spite of the brain s complexity, a thorough understanding of the neural basis of many cognitive processes is possible.  Thanks to the new theory, three basic questions can now be readily answered: Why are grid cells organized into discrete modules, within which all grid lattices share the same spatial scale and orientation, but have different spatial offsets? Why do the spatial scales of the grid lattices form a geometric progression? And why is the observed scale ratio close to 3/2?  If grid cells were not organized into modules with fixed grid scale and orientation, the brain could not use population vectors to represent spatial position,  explains Martin Stemmler.  The geometric progression in the grid scales maximizes the spatial resolution of the neural code, based on just a few bursts of neural activity. Finally, the scale ratio should be close to 3/2 to avoid large-scale errors when information from different grid modules is combined to calculate a single quantity, the animal s position estimate.  The theory also shows that grid cells can be used not only to estimate position in world-centered coordinates, but also to tell the direction to some goal for example, a food source or the animal s home in self-centered coordinates, a key requirement for navigation.  Transiently silencing individual grid modules should lead to specific types of navigational errors a prediction that can be tested in future research , says Alexander Mathis. Perhaps most importantly, the new work translates the hitherto rather hazy notion of  a neural metric for space  into a precisely defined mathematical framework. The results have already helped to settle a recent controversy in the field   whether the observed distortions of grid patterns falsify the proposed role of grid cells as a metric for space (no, they don t) and will, most probably, also guide future experiments.

The research will focus on using Emulate s Small Airway Lung-Chip and Intestine-Chip to enable predictive modeling of inflammatory processes in the human lung and the gastrointestinal system. The public disclosure of this expanded collaboration coincides with the publication in the peer reviewed journal Nature Methods of data showing new capabilities of the Lung-Chip technology to achieve accurate modeling of the human lung small airways. The collaborative work by Merck and Emulate researchers enabled new functionality for the Small Airway Lung-Chip to demonstrate the mechanism of action for therapeutic compounds acting on inflammatory disease states in the small airway, particularly in diseases such as asthma. This work provided greater mechanistic understanding of airway remodeling that occurs as a result of viral exacerbation in respiratory diseases and an improved model for predicting the response to therapeutic candidates.  Working closely alongside the drug development teams at Merck offers an outstanding opportunity to create new benchmarks for the R&D process, with the ultimate goal of optimizing drug candidates earlier by testing them in Organ-Chips that mirror what happens in the patients whom the medicines are designed to treat and cure,  said Geraldine A. Hamilton, Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Emulate.  This collaboration has already resulted in exciting new capabilities and insights for R&D for small airway diseases, and we look forward to further advancing the application of the Organ-Chips to improve therapeutic development . Under the terms of the collaboration agreement with Merck, Emulate will provide the use of its Organ-Chip technology in two specific organ systems, the Small Airway Lung-Chip and the Intestine-Chip, to advance drug discovery and development across certain Merck R&D programs. Emulate will retain the rights to any resulting discoveries related to the Organ-Chip technology. In addition, Merck has the option to extend the collaboration to include additional organs, disease models or drug programs. Other terms of the agreement are not disclosed. The collaborative R&D program with Merck and Emulate is designed to use Organ-Chips to create true-to-life human models of how cells and tissues are remodeled in inflammatory processes and, consequently, how they alter the structure and function of human organs. Specifically, the collaboration is focused on two of the major organs, the lung and large intestine, in which prevalent disease states of inflammation cause a significant burden on human health. In the highly interactive collaboration between the two companies, Emulate researchers bring the state-of-the-art technology and capabilities of Organ-Chips and Merck researchers contribute extensive know-how in validating the results from the Lung-Chip and Intestine-Chip with tool compounds against current animal models and clinical data. Organ-Chips for Emulating Human Biology Based on the Organ-Chip technology, Emulate has created a new living Human Emulation System that provides a real-time window into the inner-workings of human biology, offering researchers ways to predict human response with greater precision and detail than today s cell culture or animal-based testing. An Organ-Chip such as the lung, liver, brain or kidney contains tiny hollow channels lined with tens of thousands of living human cells and tissues, and is approximately the size of a USB memory stick. Each chip is a living, micro-engineered environment that recreates the natural physiology and mechanical forces that cells experience within the human body. The Human Emulation System can link multiple Organ-Chips together to model interactions between different organs and predict whole body or systemic-level. ","Published: December 21, 2015"

The findings show promising evidence for creating a broad-spectrum antiviral.  Our compound has an antiviral effect against all these viruses,  said Michael Gale Jr., University of Washington professor of immunology and director of the UW Center for Innate Immunity and Immune Disease.  The finding emerged from research by his lab in concert with scientists at Kineta Inc. and the University of Texas at Galveston.  Gale said he thinks the findings are the first to show that innate immunity can be triggered therapeutically through a  molecule present in all our cells, known as RIG-I.  RIG-I is a cellular protein known as a pathogen recognition receptor. These receptors detect viral RNA and signal an innate immune response inside the cell that is essential for limiting and controlling viral infections. The signal induces the expression of many innate immune and antiviral genes and the production of antiviral gene products, pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and interferons.   These products act in concert to suppress and control virus infection,  the researchers wrote.  Such activation of the innate immune response to control viral infection has been tested successfully in cells and in mice.  Next steps would be to test dosing and stability in animal models and then in humans, a process that could take two to five years, Gale said.  Currently, there are no known broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and few therapeutic options against infection by RNA viruses. RNA viruses pose a significant public health problem worldwide because their high mutation rate allows them to escape the immune response. They are a frequent cause of emerging and re-emerging viral infections. West Nile virus infections, for example, started in the United States in 2000 and remerged in 2012. The World Health Organization reports 50 million to 100 million new cases of dengue fever yearly and 22,000 deaths caused by the related dengue virus. Dengue is now present in the southern U.S.  Hepatitis C, which is transmitted through the blood, infects upward of 4 million people each year; 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk for developing cirrhosis or liver cancer, according to the paper. Direct-acting antivirals can control hepatitis C and show promise of long-term cure, but viral mutation to drug resistance is a concern with prolonged use of these drugs. Also the drugs  exorbitant costs make them unaffordable to many or most patients. ""There is tremendous interest in triggering innate immunity,"" said Shawn Iadonato, chief scientific officer at Seattle biotech Kineta. Some viral infections, he pointed out, cannot be treated by traditional antivirals. Activating innate immunity also will make the viruses less likely to resist the drug actions because the therapy targets the cell, via gene action, rather than the virus itself.  It s routine for us to think of broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the equivalent for virology doesn t exist,  Iadonato said. ","Published: December 21, 2015"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/mapping-the-mechanical-properties-of-living-cells-200217,Mapping the Mechanical Properties of Living Cells Researchers have developed a new way to use atomic force microscopy to rapidly measure the mechanical properties of cells at the nanometer scale  an advance that could pave the way for better understanding immune disorders and cancer  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In his role as a pediatrician, Manish Butte, MD, PhD, will often push and prod a patient s abdomen, feeling for abnormalities   a swollen spleen, a hardened lymph node or an unusual lump in the intestines or liver. There are still some things that can only be gleaned by touch, and Butte believes this notion applies to individual cells as well. Yet researchers  ability to probe and measure the features of living cells has been almost nonexistent. Recently, a team of Stanford scientists and engineers set out to right that imbalance with a new technique for rapidly mapping cells. They succeeded by engineering a major advancement in a technology known as atomic force microscopy, or AFM, which itself was invented at Stanford in 1986. A paper describing the work was published online Butte, an assistant professor of pediatric immunology, is the senior author. Lead authorship is shared by Andrew Wang, PhD, a former postdoctoral scholar in Butte s lab, and Karthik Vijayrhagavan, PhD, who was a graduate student and member of the microphotonics lab led by Olav Solgaard, PhD, a professor of electrical engineering.  What a cell feels like   its mechanical properties that affect how it makes contact with other cells and tissues   is much more important than what it looks like, but the technology just wasn t there to allow us to examine it,  Butte said.  There is a lot to be learned from studying the mechanics of a cell and its structures just beneath the surface.  The way Butte and his colleagues use AFM to measure the mechanical properties of cells is akin to the way a builder taps her knuckles along a drywall, listening for the change in pitch that will tell her a wooden stud is on the other side. When an AFM probe taps the surface of a cell, it vibrates, and the pattern of these vibrations, like the sound waves reflecting from the stud, gives mechanical information about the structures of the cell being touched. However, existing AFM probes are relatively large and, as a result, insensitive to high frequencies, which communicate much of the key information about a cell s innards. The Stanford team s device couples a very small probe with a traditional one. This assembly allows the device to sense faster oscillations than conventional devices and, accordingly, to take more detailed and much faster measurements.  The main difference between this and previous atomic force microscopes is that we are able to measure the impact of the probe on the cell very fast and get specific readings, whereas typical AFMs simply provide an average. This allows us to accurately measure some very soft materials for the first time,  said Solgaard, who also is a co-author of the paper. Current probes measure cellular stiffness by tapping against the cell around one or two times per second   the fastest that the large probes can make measurements. The small probe, however, can make detailed measurements easily at five to 10,000 taps per second because of its sensitivity. He likened the leap in sensitivity to the difference between driving a Cadillac Escalade down the road and pushing a Hot Wheel toy car along the same surface:  The small Hot Wheel will feel every little bump so much more than the large Cadillac.   Beautiful solution  AFMs measure movement of the probe by bouncing a laser off its tip. As the tip moves up and down, the laser is reflected. The Stanford invention couples the small probe with the large one by means of a fork-shaped structure called an interferometric grating. The grating produces a diffraction pattern based on the movements of the small probe, and allows the AFM to conveniently capture its measurements.  Our tip actually produces a second signal, and that is what allows us to get much greater detail. From an engineering standpoint, it s an extremely simple, beautiful solution,  Solgaard said, referring to the diffracted signals from the grating. Best of all, the team s device can be directly attached to existing AFMs, potentially saving millions of dollars on new equipment that could otherwise be spent on research. A new AFM can run as much as $500,000, according to Solgaard. The objective is the cellular equivalent of Butte pressing a child s abdomen.  We want to study cell stiffness to understand what is beneath the surface and how cells are structured,  Wang said. As a demonstration, the team measured a section of a red blood cell, making approximately 4 million total measurements in about 10 minutes   all without damaging the delicate cellular exterior.  The same measurements would have taken more than a month to complete using conventional atomic force microscopes,  said Vijayraghavan. The technology is so fast that the team was able to create a series of time-lapse images of a living cell, each taken just seven minutes apart, a previously unimaginable pace. Potential applications The practical applications of the device range from basic scientific understanding of cellular structure to immunology and oncology. Scientific understanding of the mechanical forces at play in cells is so lacking that the field   now being called mechanobiology   is really in its infancy, according to Butte. The mechanical forces in the body can come from tissues, which range in stiffness from softest brain matter to stiffest bones, from gravity, and even from the pushing and pulling movements of other cells. Cancer cells make their environment mechanically rigid by secreting chemicals that stiffen up the extracellular matrix. Cancer cells likewise interpret the mechanical forces of a tissue to make decisions about growth and metastasis. Surprising feedback loops like this also appear to occur for stem cells in the bone marrow and during embryonic development. How immune cells interpret mechanical forces is still totally unknown.  The lowest-hanging fruit is cancer. Cancers are often stiffer than normal, healthy tissues and we can use that knowledge to diagnose disease. But first, you have to have good data, which our device provides,  Wang said. He has already used an early form of the new Stanford probe in pilot work on breast cancer specimens taken from mastectomies. For his part, Butte plans to use fast AFM to study the immune system. He hopes to explore why otherwise disease-fighting T cells often remain dormant once inside a tumor. He theorizes that the mechanical stiffness of the tumorous tissue may be preventing T cells from freely making contact with cancer cells and from triggering their cancer-fighting functions. In essence, the tumor may be too crowded for the T cells to work. On the other end of the stiffness gamut, he believes that the soft mechanical properties of chronically inflamed or infected tissues provoke the immune system into over-activity, like autoimmunity. It is a theory no one has yet explored due to technical barriers, which the fast AFM could overcome. Butte s lab has begun a broad effort to link mechanical forces with immune responses at the molecular, cellular and tissue scales.  There is so much we don t know about the mechanical properties of various cell types and diseased tissues. Almost nothing, in fact,  Butte said.  The first step is to probe. Now, we can do that.

The survey amongst key companies in Spain s pharma supply and manufacturing sectors shows that, despite recent falls in overall value, the country s manufacturers are now targeting increased FDI and exports   primarily to Latin America and Europe, but also increasing to the USA. CPhI Worldwide is a global hub for insight and analysis and is increasing the key barometer of the industry s future direction and health. Following the event, we have summarised the hot topics and emerging trends in Spain. Some 36,368 professionals and 2490 exhibitors attended CPhI Worldwide in Madrid, and thanks to this success, and renewed buoyancy in the Spanish market, the event will return in Barcelona for 2016   home to a thriving biotech and manufacturing cluster ripe for investment. One of the main growth opportunities to emerge from the surveys is that Spain retains an enormous amount of early stage innovations, but has until recently lacked the capital to take these into development and commercialisation. However, with the easing of financial conditions from  la crisis , and initiatives to encourage local and international funding we should see more projects moving into later stage work. For example, the Spanish Bioindustry Association (ASEBIO) stated it is now working towards helping establish  fiscal incentives  for innovation and is encouraging the Government to create  centres of excellence  to fully capitalise on the market s potential. Another notable trend reported is that as the overall domestic market shrank, generic exports have continued to grow rapidly (30-40%) over the last 5-years. This trend is forecast to continue, as by European and US standards, manufacturing and labour costs remain highly competitive. Led by the successful international sales from companies like Esteve, Grifols and Gropo, a new wave of SMEs are targeting exports to Europe and Latin America. Whilst some of the longer established companies, with FDA approved GMP sites, are also looking to gain increased traction in the United States. Farmaindustria, the national association for the pharmaceutical industry, states opportunities are uneven between national and multinational providers. The director general, Humberto Arn s, added:  Our national companies are related in terms of their geographical reach   Europe being the most important [currently]   and there is still much work to do in internalizing them. The industry needs to generate trust from investors to build a predictable Spanish market and export platform. But Spain is well positioned to grow.  Next year at CPhI Worldwide in Barcelona, a new collated event in Finished Dosage Formulation (FDF)will launch and is designed to bring the entire supply chain together in one global location, from Big Pharma and CMO, to out-licensing specialists, end product distributors, end-user agents, and home markets. In fact, the CPhI findings highlighted that Life Science investment in Barcelona has doubled in recent years and nearly half of all R&D in Spain is located in the region.  Across the APIs and intermediates market, companies are also reporting increased confidence in sales growth, particularly for products beyond the $100/Kg threshold, with oncology and high potents attracting the attention of many manufacturers. Overall, the market remains somewhat ambivalent about generics, with price referencing forcing patented products to match the price of generics on introduction to the market, which is providing significant marginal problems for both product classes. However, in the longer term, with less than 50% of pharmaceutical volumes (38%) and only 18% of value, clearly generics represent a major area of future growth to bring Spain inline with other major European nations   whose use of generics, by volume, averages 55% (25% average by value). This revenue expansion opportunity is also being strongly supported by generic manufacturers moving towards exports and new markets, where there are less price restrictions.  We have held several successful CPhI events in Spain over the last decade, but the sense of optimism and opportunities in the local and international market this year was particularly noticeable. Spain, as our survey notes, is split into two key pharma hubs and its hugely exciting to be moving to Barcelona next year - a region we feel is primed to become increasingly significant within the industry. What s more, with the growth in finished formulation dosages, it was also the ideal time to introduce a new dedicated zone, more details of which will be announced in the New Year.

These included  the creation of a long-sought  gene drive  that could eliminate pests or the diseases they carry, and the first deliberate editing of the DNA of human embryos.  The implications of editing human embryos drove UC Berkeley inventor Jennifer Doudna to convene a discussion of CRISPR ethics in Napa in January, which led to an international summit in Washington early this month and a consensus statement to hold off on using gene-editing technologies to alter human eggs, sperm or embryos   so-called germline gene-editing   until more is known about the long-term implications of making hereditary changes to the human genome. CRISPR, or CRISPR-Cas9, has invaded every other area of genetics, however, leading to genetically modified pigs, beagles and wheat.  Longer-lasting tomatoes, allergen-free peanuts and biofuel-friendly poplars are all on the drawing board,  Travis wrote. And biomedical applications are blossoming as scientists apply CRISPR to diseases such as diabetes, AIDS and cancer.  In short, it s only slightly hyperbolic to say that if scientists can dream of a genetic manipulation, CRISPR can now make it happen,  Travis concluded.  It s the simple truth. For better or worse, we all now live in CRISPR s world.  UC Berkeley scientists also contributed to two runners-up for Breakthrough of the Year. Barbara Romanowicz and her team in the Department of Earth and Planetary Science published a report in September that helped show that  plumes of hot rock rising from the bottom of the mantle do exist,  according to Science. And John Dueber and his team in the Department of Bioengineering played a key role in engineering yeast to produce opiods.","Published: December 21, 2015"

Increased CK1  expression is common to breast cancer, including the difficult-to-treat subtype called  triple negative breast cancer  (those cancers not driven by estrogen, progesterone, or the HER-2/neu gene), affecting 10 to 20 percent of breast cancer patients. The study was a collaboration among the Florida labs of Derek Duckett and William R. Roush, both of TSRI, and John Cleveland, formerly of TSRI and currently at the Moffitt Cancer Center.  Our findings confirm that aberrant CK1  regulation promotes tumor growth in breast cancers by activating the protein  -catenin,  said Duckett, an associate professor at Scripps Florida.  The best news, however, is that we have been able to treat CK1 -expressing breast cancers with a highly selective and potent CK1  inhibitor developed by Bill Roush s lab that triggers rapid tumor cell death.  At the beginning of the study, the team knew that the  -catenin protein was an oncogene in many cancers, but it was unclear why it was activated in these breast cancer types since they lacked typical mutations in those pathways. The researchers suspected the link could be overexpression of CK1 . Their experiments showed that indeed to be the case. To confirm the new target, the study used the Roush lab compound, called SR-3029. SR-3029 was remarkably successful at blocking the growth of tumors in both animal models and in studies with tumor tissue from breast cancer patients.  SR-3029 removes  -catenin from cancer cells, killing the tumors,  explained Duckett.  This is an extraordinarily promising strategy for targeted treatment with SR-3029, especially in breast cancers that lack targeted treatment options.   These results are just the tip of the iceberg,  added Roush, who is professor, associate dean and executive director of medicinal chemistry at TSRI.  Inhibitors such as SR-3029 are being studied in a host of different cancers, and we are hopeful this platform can be translated into clinical applications. ","Published: December 21, 2015"

In this case, our heroes are potent antibodies from the body s immune system that bind to and neutralize HIV and the story could lead to a vaccine against AIDS. In a new study, a team led by scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) tracked how a family of these HIV-fighting antibodies develops over time. The research shows how a future vaccine might trigger the immune system to produce these antibodies more effectively.  If you could produce these antibodies through vaccination, that would be a really fantastic start to preventing HIV,  said Ian Wilson, Hansen Professor of Structural Biology and chair of the Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology at TSRI. Antibodies in Training At boot camp, it takes time for soldiers to hone their response against a specific threat. Similarly, it takes time for immune system cells to identify a particular virus s weak points and enlist antibodies that mutate, tweaking their structures to better bind to and neutralize the virus. In the case of one family of HIV-targeting antibodies known as PGT121, it takes around two years for antibodies to mature enough to fight HIV. While this delay is too long to be effective in preventing infection, the existence of these antibodies inspired scientists to try to find ways to harness their power in a vaccine. In the new study, scientists looked at the early stages of development in the PGT121 family, specifically in the PGT122 and PGT124 branches. These antibodies caught scientists  attention because they are  broadly neutralizing,  meaning they can stop many strains of the rapidly mutating virus. They also have the special ability to target a piece of viral machinery called the HIV Envelope glycoprotein, which enables the virus to bind to and penetrate host cells. Using high-resolution imaging techniques, the researchers mapped out the structures of these antibodies, bound with the HIV Envelope glycoprotein, at select points in their boot-camp training. They found that different branches of antibodies developed different strategies to get around HIV s defenses. The Anti-HIV Arms Race The antibodies  main obstacle is HIV s glycan shield, a layer of sugars that sits on the HIV Envelope glycoprotein, protecting it from the body s antibody attacks.  The virus is always trying to escape the immune system, and the immune system via antibodies tries to go after it,  said Fernando Garces, research associate at TSRI and first author of the new study.  What makes PGT121 family of antibodies so special,  he added,  is that it has found ways to counter-attack the virus while many other families of antibodies fail to do so.  The images in the new study showed that the PGT121 family of antibodies starts its attack by grabbing onto one of the glycans, (called the N332 glycan) as well as a short segment of the HIV Envelope glycoprotein (called the GDIR motif), turning them into binding partners. From there, the researchers observed that antibodies within this family developed slightly different strategies. While antibodies from the PGT122 branch mutate to engage other surrounding glycans (the N137 glycan), the PGT124 branch appears to do the same, but then circumvents other elements of the glycan shield (again, the N137 glycan) by rotating and tilting to target the HIV Envelope glycoprotein beneath. Working Toward a Rapid Response Interestingly, if researchers remove the N137 glycan from HIV, the antibodies immediately behave as well-trained antibodies and don t require a two-year boot camp.  That suggests possible strategies for how one might elicit those antibodies through vaccination,  said Wilson. If scientists can design a molecule that lacks this N137 glycan, they may be able to prompt a faster antibody response. Once the antibody response has been kick-started, they could add this glycan back and try to mature the antibody against the more native form of the virus. The new study also showed a much-improved 3D image of the HIV Envelope protein. This detailed  map  of the final pieces of HIV s trimer structure will help researchers design HIV vaccines.  The take-away message is that you ve really got to track the evolution of the antibody and the antigen [the target on a virus] in order to understand how the immune response targets HIV,  said Wilson. Wilson added that the study required a  team approach.  The findings resulted from collaborations with the laboratory of TSRI Professor Dennis R. Burton, who is also scientific director of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) Neutralizing Antibody Center and of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery (CHAVI-ID) at TSRI, which produced the antibodies for the study; the laboratory of TSRI Associate Professor Andrew Ward, which performed the electron microscopy imaging that helped reveal how the antibodies bind; and the labs of Rogier Sanders of the University of Amsterdam and Weill Medical College of Cornell University and John P. Moore of Weill Medical College of Cornell University.","Published: December 21, 2015"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/a-gene-for-new-species-is-identified-185438,A Gene for New Species is Identified A University of Utah led study identified a long sought  hybrid inviability gene  responsible for dead or infertile offspring when two species of fruit flies mate with each other   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The discovery sheds light on the genetic and molecular process leading to formation of new species, and may provide clues to how cancer develops.  We knew for decades that something like this gene ought to exist, and our approach finally allowed us to identify it,  says biologist Nitin Phadnis, principal author of the study. The definition of a species is that it cannot breed successfully with another species, so  to understand speciation is to understand how these reproductive barriers evolved,  he says.  You call them new species when there are barriers that prevent them from breeding with each other. Identifying these genes and uncovering the molecular basis of hybrid sterility or death is key to understanding how new species evolve and remains one of the big and longstanding questions in biology since Darwin.  A big surprise is that the gene that makes fruit fly hybrids inviable   named gfzf   is a  cell cycle-regulation gene  or  cell cycle-checkpoint gene  normally involved in stopping cell division and replication if defects are detected. But when mutated and disabled in the new study, the gene allowed the survival of male hybrids of the two fruit fly species. The gfzf gene evolves quickly, which is what biologists expect from hybrid inviability genes. But it also was a surprise since cell cycle-checkpoint genes usually evolve slowly because they are  conserved  genes essential in most organisms. That and the discovery that gfzf causes death or infertility in fruit fly hybrids  is really important in cancer biology,  Phadnis says.  Cancer biologists are interested in cell cycle checkpoints because you can get cancer when those go bad [and cells proliferate uncontrolled]. Biologists want to understand the machinery. This work shows that some of those components in the cell cycle policing machinery may be quickly changing.  Phadnis and colleagues had to overcome several technical obstacles to identity gfzfas the speciation gene, and he speculates that using similar techniques could show  that this sort of process may prove to be important in many other species.  A tale of two fruit flies The new study involved two closely related species of fruit flies found worldwide:Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. Phadnis says both fruit fly species have been around a couple million years. Phadnis says the new study  successfully solves one of the most celebrated cases in speciation genetics,  namely, why hybrid offspring of the two species are not viable. Geneticists have sought fruit fly inviability genes ever since 1910, when they first noted hybrids between the two species were dead, Phadnis says. During the past decade, other scientists identified and implicated two other genes that play a role in causing dead or infertile offspring when the two fruit fly species mate: a D. simulans gene named Lhr (lethal hybrid rescue) and a D. melanogastergene named Hmr (hybrid male rescue). If either gene is absent, hybrid males survive. But evidence indicated a third, unknown gene also was required to make hybrids dead or sterile. Phadnis says new species evolve when two populations of one species become separated   usually geographically   and then  something changes in their genome such that when they previously used to be compatible, now their hybrids are dysfunctional.  He says it is extremely difficult to identify hybrid inviability genes. Genetics usually involves breeding to identify genes responsible for a particular function or malfunction. But if hybrids are dead or infertile, that doesn t work. In addition, genetic research tools were designed for D. melanogaster   the fruit flies used in genetics experiments   not for D. simulans, which earlier research indicated carries the newly identified gene. Finally, there is no naturally occurring mutant of the newly identified hybrid inviability gene to isolate and identify in natural fly populations. So  we figured out a way to sidestep traditional barriers  by reversing hybrid incompatibilities between the two fruit fly species and using next-generation sequencing of their genetic blueprints, Phadnis says. Breeding mutant male hybrid fruit flies that live Phadnis and colleagues fed 55,000 male D. simulans fruit flies a mutation-causing chemical, mated mutant D. simulans males with normal D. melanogaster females, and then determined which mutated genes allowed some male hybrids to live. All hybrid males normally die during the transition from larva to pupa, so they never become adult flies. The resulting offspring included 300,000 hybrid females   which were sterile but alive   and only 32 living male hybrids, also sterile. Only six of the live male hybrids were alive due to a mutation that disabled the yet-unidentified hybrid inviability gene, so the other 26 weren t analyzed. The researchers then sequenced the genomes or genetic blueprints of those six male hybrid fruit flies, and of both strains of parent fruit flies. Then they compared the D. simulans part of the genomes of the six live hybrid males to the genomes of the non-mutant strain of D. simulans parent flies. That allowed Phadnis and colleagues to identify all the 600 to 1,200 new mutations in each of the six live hybrid males. In what Phadnis calls  a surprisingly clean result,  the researchers found only a single D. simulans fruit fly gene was mutant in all six live hybrid males: a gene on the third chromosome named gfzf. Thus, the gfzf gene from D. simulans is the hybrid inviability gene that normally helps kill hybrid males but allows them to live when silenced by a mutation. Researchers don t yet know the gfzf gene s normal role at a molecular level, but Phadnis plans to study that next. He also plans to investigate whether there are more genes involved in inviability of offspring when the two fruit fly species mate. Why would a gene that makes hybrids inviable exist? Shouldn t natural selection eliminate it over time? Phadnis says such genes are selected for some other characteristic   researchers don t yet know what   and  the hybrid s death is an accidental consequence of that evolution.  Phadnis speculates gfzf may be favored by natural selection because it helps control so-called jumping genes, which can disrupt essential genes to create disease-causing mutations. Why is it important to learn how one species can become two new species?  Even when we are little kids, one of the first things we discover about the world is the tremendous number and diversity of species on Earth,  Phadnis says.  Speciation is the engine producing that diversity. So understanding speciation has been a longstanding problem, even before the days of Darwin. Now, we finally are able to use technology in creative ways to solve such old, longstanding problems. ","Published: December 21, 2015"

The research examines a previously unknown connection between flaviviruses--a classification of viruses that include West Nile virus, Dengue virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus--and organelles (a specialized subunit within a cell) known as peroxisomes that help coordinate the body's immune responses. Postdoctoral fellow Jaehwan You and PhD student Shangmei Hou, the lead authors on the study, found that flaviviruses induce degradation of a protein called Pex19, which is essential for the building of new peroxisomes, setting off a chain reaction that could leave the body more vulnerable to viral infection.""Peroxisomes, as it turns out, are required for production of an antiviral molecule called interferon lambda,"" says Tom Hobman, senior author and professor of cell biology at the U of A. ""Interferon lambda is produced by infected cells and has been shown to inhibit replication of multiple viruses. We hypothesized that loss of peroxisomes results in the loss of the ability of the cells to produce this interferon, which indeed was found to be the case. ""It looks like the virus may be targeting peroxisomes to prevent antiviral defense by the cell."" The study found that in infected cells, about 35 per cent of the peroxisomes had disappeared. Production of interferon was also down by approximately 80 per cent. Richard Rachubinski, a study co-author and one of the world's leading authorities on peroxisomes, says that while the team set out to find how viruses manipulate host cells, the link to peroxisomes was completely unexpected. ""You can't plan this. You just cannot,"" says Rachubinski, who is also chair of the U of A's Department of Cell Biology. ""It goes to show the unexpected avenues one finds in discovery research that you'd never anticipate."" Flaviviruses impact a large proportion of the world's population. West Nile virus is the most prevalent mosquito transmitted pathogen in North America, with infected patients at risk of developing severe neurological disease. Dengue virus is a related virus, with more than 400 million infections worldwide every year. There is currently no vaccine or treatment available for either virus. According to the researchers, this latest work may now open new possibilities for intervention in flavivirus infection. ""It's certainly within the realm of possibility that if peroxisomes play this key role in antiviral defense, it may be possible to take drugs that are known to boost peroxisome production to provide protection against the viruses,"" says Hobman. The researchers think it likely that other viruses may also target peroxisomes in a similar manner to flaviviruses. They hope to now show it through new studies which are currently underway. ""I think we're just at the tip of the iceberg,"" says Hobman. ""No one has ever really thought about viruses and peroxisomes before. Now I think there is going to be a flood of work in this field.""","Published: December 21, 2015"

""Our study shows that our compound has an antiviral effect against all these viruses,"" said Michael Gale Jr., UW professor of immunology and director of the UW Center for Innate Immunity and Immune Disease. Gale said the findings are the first he knows of which show that a small molecule can trigger innate immunity through a molecule present in all our cells known as RIG-I. RIG-I is a cellular protein known as pathogen recognition receptor. These receptors function to detect viral RNA and signal an innate immune response inside the cell that is essential for limiting and controlling viral infections. This signaling then induces the expression of many innate immune and antiviral genes and the production of antiviral gene products, pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and interferons. ""These products act in concert to suppress and control virus infection,"" the researchers wrote. The researchers said inducing signaling to activate the innate immune response to control virus infection has been tested successfully in cells and in mice. The next step would be to test dosing and stability in animal models and then in humans - a process that could take between two and five years, said Gale. Currently, there are no known broad spectrum antiviral drugs, and few cures for infection by RNA viruses, much less much effective treatments. RNA viruses pose a significant public health problem worldwide because of their high mutation rate that allows them to escape the immune response, and they are a frequent cause of emerging and re-emerging viral infections. West Nile virus infections, for example, started in the USA in 2000 and remerged again in 2012. Moreover, the World Health Organization reports about 50 million to 100 million new cases of dengue fever yearly and 22,000 deaths caused by the related dengue virus. Dengue is now present in the southern U.S. Hepatitis C, which is transmitted through the blood, infects about 3 million-4 million people each year and about 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk for developing liver cirrhosis or liver cancer, according to the paper. Researchers said direct acting antiviral drugs have been developed to control hepatitis C and show promise of long-term cure of infection but treatment of disparate hepatitis C genotypes remains a concern, and viral mutation to drug resistance is an underlying concern with prolonged use of these drugs. Also, the researchers noted, the cost of the drugs are exorbitant, which make them unaffordable to most patients. Shawn Iadonato, the chief scientific officer at Kineta, a Seattle-based biotechnology firm, said there is tremendous interest in triggering innate immunity for a number of reasons. One, he said, is because some viral infections can't be treated by traditional antivirals, such as chronic hepatitis B infection. Also, by triggering innate immunity, the viruses will be much less likely to resist the drug actions because they are targeted to the cell through the actions of many different genes and not to the virus itself, thus making drug resistance much harder if not impossible to achieve. The span of viruses that could be treated would also have a huge benefit globally since many RNA viruses - Ebola, Nipah, Lassa and dengue - affect mainly developing countries. ""It's routine for us to think of broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the equivalent for virology doesn't exist,"" said Iadonato.","Published: December 21, 2015"

The University of New South Wales study, jointly led by Associate Professor Cyrille Boyer of the School of Chemical Engineering and deputy director of Australian Centre for NanoMedicine, has recently been published.   Chronic biofilm-based infections are often extremely resistant to antibiotics and many other conventional antimicrobial agents, and have a high capacity to evade the body s immune system,  said Associate Professor Boyer.  Our study points to a pathway for the non-toxic dispersal of biofilms in infected tissue, while also greatly improving the effect of antibiotic therapies.  Biofilms have been linked to 80% of infections, forming on living tissues (eg. respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tracts, oral cavities, eyes, ears, wounds, heart and cervix) or dwelling in medical devices (eg. dialysis catheters, prosthetic implants and contact lenses). The formation of biofilms is a growing and costly problem in hospitals, creating infections that are more difficult to treat   leading to chronic inflammation, impaired wound healing, rapidly acquired antibiotic resistance and the spread of infectious embolisms in the bloodstream. They also cause fouling and corrosion of wet surfaces, and the clogging of filtration membranes in sensitive equipment   even posing a threat to public health by acting as reservoirs of pathogens in distribution systems for drinking water. In general, bacteria have two life forms during growth and proliferation: planktonic, where bacteria exist as single, independent cells; or aggregated together in colonies as biofilms, where bacteria grow in a slime-like polymer matrix that protects them from the environment around them. Acute infections mostly involve planktonic bacteria, which are usually treatable with antibiotics. However, when bacteria have had enough time to form a biofilm   within a human host or non-living material such as dialysis catheters   an infection can often become untreatable and develop into a chronic state. Although biofilms were first recognised in the 17th century, their importance was not realised until the 1990s, when it became clear that microbes exist in nature more often in colonies made up of lots of different microorganisms that adhere to surfaces through slime excreted by their inhabitants. Thus began a global race to understand biofilms, at a time when it was also realised they were responsible for the majority of chronic infections. The discovery of how to dislodge biofilms by the UNSW Faculty of Engineering team   jointly led by Dr Nicolas Barraud, formerly of UNSW and now at France s Institut Pasteur   was made using the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This is a model organism whose response to the technique the researchers believe will apply to most other bacteria. When biofilms want to colonise a new site, they disperse into individual cells, reducing the protective action of the biofilm. It is this process the UNSW team sought to trigger, making the bacteria again susceptible to antimicrobial agents. The UNSW team found that by injecting iron oxide nanoparticles into the biofilms, and using an applied magnetic field to heat them   which induces local hyperthermia through raising the temperature by 5 C or more   the biofilms were triggered into dispersing. They achieved this using iron oxide nanoparticles coated with polymers that help stabilise and maintain the nanoparticles in a dispersed state, making them an ideal non-toxic tool for treating biofilm infections.   The use of these polymer-coated iron oxide nanoparticles to disperse biofilms may have broad applications across a range of clinical and industrial settings,  said Associate Professor Boyer, who in October was named Physical Scientist of the Year in the Prime Minister s Prizes for Science.  Once dispersed, the bacteria are easier to deal with   creating the potential to remove recalcitrant, antimicrobial-tolerant biofilm infections. ","Published: December 21, 2015"

DNA damage is one of the most important mechanisms of ageing where stem cells lose their ability to maintain and repair the tissues in which they live and keep it working correctly. The pioneering research shows the drug protects the stem cells from DNA damage enhancing their survival and maintaining their function. Professor Ilaria Bellantuono, from the University s Department of Metabolism, said:  The drug enhances the repair of the damage in DNA occurring with age in stem cells in the bone. It is also likely to work in other stem cells too.  This drug has been shown to delay mortality in patients affected by osteoporosis but until now we didn t know why. These findings provide an explanation as to why it may help people to live longer.  Now we want to understand whether the drug can be used to delay or revert the ageing in stem cells in older people and improve the maintenance of tissues such as the heart, the muscle and immune cells, keeping them healthier for longer.  We want to understand whether it improves the ability of stem cells to repair those tissues after injury, such as when older patients with cancer undergo radiotherapy.  Approximately 50 per cent of over 75 year-olds have three or more diseases at the same time such as cardiovascular disease, infections, muscle weakness and osteoporosis. In the future it is hoped this drug could be used to treat, prevent or delay the onset of such diseases rather than using a mixture of drugs. Dr Bellantuono added:  We are hopeful that this research will pave the way for a better cure for cancer patients and keeping older people healthier for longer by reducing the risk of developing multiple age-related diseases.

Developed to undertake a detailed study of collagen, the researchers argue that the same methodology can be used with any protein-based sample and is currently being tested with cancer cells and proteins relevant to Type II diabetes. Named 2D Mass Spectrometry (2DMS), the test provides a new tool in the rapidly expanding field research into the structure and function of proteins; Proteomics. Led by the O Connor Research Group in the University of Warwick s Department of Chemistry, the researchers found that the large protein collagen can be sliced into smaller fragments and analysed by multidimensional mass spectrometry to yield data which is 1000x more detailed than previously possible with mass spectrometry, and 100% faster than analysing the same sample by existing techniques. Commenting on 2DMS and its potential Professor Peter O Connor, of the University of Warwick s department of Chemistry and leader of the O Connor Group, said:  Within each and every cancer cell there are at least a million peptides comprising the protein machines that enable the cell to function. Understanding the structure and chemistry of all peptides and proteins will enable ground-breaking treatments to be developed, with 2DMS providing a new tool for studying them in far greater detail than before . 2DMS was inspired by tools from the field of nuclear magnetic resonance whereby signals are spread out on a multidimensional canvas, by modulating particular signals in the sample and then tracing those modulation frequencies in the final signal. Professor O Connor explains:  The 2DMS method modulates ion signal intensities in a way which carries over into fragment ion signals, and therefore allows the researchers to correlate individual fragment ion signals with their precursor ion   effectively allowing sequencing of each molecule in the sample simultaneously.  Since collagen has more than 400 individual peptide signals and whole cells have tens of thousands, this method saves a huge amount of time because there is no need to individually isolate and fragment each one serially; they are all fragmented together in parallel, and the data can be then extracted into individual fragment scans.  This application of 2DMS originates in the undergraduate thesis project of University of Warwick Chemistry student Hayley Simon. Initially aiming to find all the known crosslinks in collagen she ran into difficulty in processing the data due to the need to isolate each of the >400 precursor peptide ions and sequence them individually. Ms. Simon then decided to try the new 2DMS technique and managed to achieve a remarkable level of separation and very detailed information. Discussing the work Ms. Simon said:  When studied by mass spectrometry, many species in the digested collagen sample appear similar. Disentangling this data, while accounting for multiple possible explanations, presented us with a significant challenge. Usually, the separation of species like this would not be possible without running many experiments. By using 2DMS, we were able to collect information about everything we observed in the collagen sample, performing just one experiment. After processing, the results are presented as a single spectrum, allowing patterns to be easily recognised. This helps identify components in the sample, which in turn can be used to determine structural information about the protein. ","Published: December 21, 2015"

In doing so, they have been able to understand how the tiny enzyme performs critical cellular duties   answering questions that have been on the table for over 50 years about this  paradigmatic protein .  Kinases are key players in metabolism, cell signalling, protein regulation, cellular transport, secretory processes, and many other cellular pathways that allow us to function healthily. They coordinate the transfer of energy from certain molecules to specific substrates, affecting their activity, reactivity, and ability to bind other molecules.  Diacylglycerol kinase, the focus of this study, plays a role in bacterial cell wall synthesis. It is a small, integral membrane enzyme that coordinates a particularly complex reaction: its lipid substrate is hydrophobic (repelled by water) and resides in cell membranes, while its co-substrate, ATP, is entirely water soluble.   How it does this had remained a mystery for decades, but the newly produced blueprints have answered these questions.   How this diminutive nanomachine, less than 10 nm tall, brings these two disparate substrates together at the membrane interface for reaction is revealed in a molecularly detailed crystal structure. It is the smallest known kinase, and seeing its form with crystal clarity is now helping us to answer questions that formed from over 50 years of work on this paradigmatic protein,  said Professor of Membrane Structural and Functional Biology at Trinity College Dublin, Martin Caffrey.  Figuring out how this tiny machine works at the molecular level was enormously facilitated by our use of one of the brightest X-ray sources on Earth, the X-ray free-electron laser at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.  Professor Caffrey added:  This instrument produces bursts of X-rays just femtoseconds (a quad-trillionth of a second) long. With these short bursts we were able to obtain structural information about the enzyme before it vaporized through radiation damage in what I tritely refer to as 'Hit and Run' serial crystallography.    According to Petra Fromme, the director of the Center for Applied Structural Discovery at Arizona State University s Biodesign Institute and a co-author of the current study,  this is the first structure of a protein that is a membrane-integral enzyme and important biocatalyst in the cell.  (Biocatalysts speed up the rate of critical biological reactions.)  The tiny kinase is one of the research targets for the NIH funded Center for Membrane Proteins in Infectious Diseases at ASU, which is devoted to unraveling the molecular basis of viral and bacterial proteins involved in diseases as well as the human proteins defending the body from pathogen attack.  The ASU team contributed to the work with expertise in crystal growth and sample injection, as well as data collection and evaluation.  In the future, the scientists hope to extend their free-electron laser work to make 'X-ray movies' of this remarkable nanomachine, so as to watch how it 'does chemistry' in atomic detail in real time.

Our study provides strong evidence to suggest that human stem cells will develop in a normal   and importantly, safe   way. This could be the news that the field of regenerative medicine has been waiting for Human pluripotent stem cells for use in regenerative medicine or biomedical research come from two sources: embryonic stem cells, derived from fertilised egg cells discarded from IVF procedures; and induced pluripotent stem cells, where skin cells are  reset  to their original, pluripotent form. They are seen as having promising therapeutic uses in regenerative medicine to treat devastating conditions that affect various organs and tissues, particularly those that have poor regenerative capacity, such as the heart, brain and pancreas. However, some scientists have been concerned that the cells may not incorporate properly into the body and hence not proliferate or distribute themselves as intended, resulting in tumours. Today s study suggests that this will not be the case and that stem cells, when transplanted appropriately, are likely to be safe for use in regenerative medicine. Professor Roger Pedersen from the Anne McLaren Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Cambridge, commenting on co-author Victoria Mascetti s research findings, says:  Our study provides strong evidence to suggest that human stem cells will develop in a normal   and importantly, safe   way. This could be the news that the field of regenerative medicine has been waiting for.  The best way to test how well stem cells would incorporate into the body is to transplant them into an early-stage embryo and see how they develop. As this cannot be done ethically in humans, scientists use mouse embryos. The gold standard test, developed in Cambridge in the 1980s, involves putting the stem cells into a mouse blastocyst, a very early stage embryo after fertilisation, then assessing stem cell contribution to the various tissues of the body. Previous research has not succeeded in getting human pluripotent stem cells to incorporate into embryos. However, in research funded by the British Heart Foundation, Victoria Mascetti and Professor Pedersen have shown that it is possible to successfully transplant human pluripotent stem cells into the mouse embryo and that they then develop and grow normally.  Stem cells hold great promise for treating serious conditions such as heart disease and Parkinson s disease, but until now there has been a big question mark over how safe and effective they will be,  explains Professor Pedersen. Mascetti s research breakthrough in this new study was to demonstrate that human pluripotent stem cells are equivalent to an embryonic counterpart. Where attempts to incorporate human pluripotent stem cells had failed previously, it was because the stem cells had not been matched to the correct stage of embryo development: the cells needed to be transplanted into the mouse embryo at a later stage than was previously thought (a stage of embryo development known as gastrulation). Once transplanted at the correct stage, the stem cells went on to grow and proliferate normally, to integrate into the embryo and to distribute themselves correctly across relevant tissues. Ms Mascetti adds:  Our finding that human stem cells integrate and develop normally in the mouse embryo will allow us to study aspects of human development during a window in time that would otherwise be inaccessible.  Professor Jeremy Pearson, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, which helped fund the study, said:  These results substantially strengthen the view that induced pluripotent stem cells from adult tissue are suitable for use in regenerative medicine   for example in attempts to repair damaged heart muscle after a heart attack.  The Cambridge team has shown definitively that when stem cells are introduced into early mouse embryos under the right conditions, they multiply and contribute in the correct way to all the cell types that are formed as the embryo develops.

These large, complex molecules are made up of building blocks called amino acids. Most of the time, proteins fold correctly, but sometimes they can misfold. This misfolding causes the proteins to get sticky, and that can promote clumping, or aggregation, which is the hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The protein's stickiness is a result of surface hydrophobic interactions that are important for many biological functions. The problem is that researchers don't have good tools to measure this stickiness with high sensitivity. Now, an interdisciplinary team at Michigan Technological University has assembled new tools to solve the case of the sticky protein.  Using the fluorescent probes, the team measured hydrophobicity in three proteins: Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), apomyoglobin and myoglobin. Compared to a commonly used commercial sensor (ANS), these new BODIPY-based hydrophobic sensors showed much stronger signal strengths, with up to a 60-fold increase in BSA.

The two flagship buildings will provide floor plates of over 10,000 sq ft (929 sq m) as well as space for conferencing and an innovation hub for start-up businesses. The R&D buildings will provide bespoke combinations of office, laboratory, production and storage. This will provide hybrid space to meet the needs of the high-tech industry, including grow on space for businesses wishing to expand beyond what the University s nearby Begbroke Science Park offers. All units will be supported by facilities including; storage yards with loading bays, secure parking and external storage for volume equipment, gas tanks and deliveries. Angus Bates, CEO of Hill Street Holdings, said:  Oxford Technology Park will deliver top quality office and R&D space for businesses of all sizes, set within 20 acres of landscaped grounds. Each unit will be modelled as bespoke units and we are able to offer  design and build  solutions to suit individual occupiers.  It represents a multi-million pound investment in the local economy with the potential to create 1,250 new jobs and satisfy local and international demand in the area for space of this kind. We expect the technology park to rapidly become a significant contributor to Oxford as a leading, global centre for research and development.  Richard Cutler, Partner of Bloombridge said:  This project has taken 13 years to come through the planning system, with a recorded loss of 352,000 sq ft of enquiries for space from R&D businesses in the last five years. We are delighted that Cherwell District Council has supported the Local Plan Inspector by confirming that very special circumstances exist for the grant of this planning permission in the Oxford Green Belt.  As George Osborne said in his Autumn Statement, in the modern world one of the best ways you can back business is by backing science, and this is exactly what Oxford Technology Park does . The units are available for pre-let and the leasing agents are VSL and Partners, and Benedicts Consultant Surveyors. Construction will start in early 2016.","Published: December 19, 2015"

The studyis published in the journal eLIFE.  Our results suggest the central thalamus works like a radio dial that tunes the brain to different states of activity and arousal,  said Jin Hyung Lee, PhD, assistant professor of neurology, neurosurgery and bioengineering at Stanford University, and a senior author of the study. Located deep inside the brain the thalamus acts as a relay station sending neural signals from the body to the cortex. Damage to neurons in the central part of the thalamus may lead to problems with sleep, attention, and memory. Previous studies suggested that stimulation of thalamic neurons may awaken patients who have suffered a traumatic brain injury from minimally conscious states. Lee s team flashed laser pulses onto light sensitive central thalamic neurons of sleeping rats, which caused the cells to fire. High frequency stimulation of 40 or 100 pulses per second woke the rats. In contrast, low frequency stimulation of 10 pulses per second sent the rats into a state reminiscent of absence seizures that caused them to stiffen and stare before returning to sleep.  This study takes a big step towards understanding the brain circuitry that controls sleep and arousal,  Yejun (Janet) He, PhD, program director at the U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH) s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). When the scientists used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan brain activity, they saw that high and low frequency stimulation put the rats in completely different states of activity. Cortical brain areas where activity was elevated during high frequency stimulation became inhibited with low frequency stimulation. Electrical recordings confirmed the results. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex fired more during high frequency stimulation of the central thalamus and less during low frequency stimulation.  Dr. Lee s innovative work demonstrates the power of using imaging technologies to study the brain at work,  said Guoying Liu, PhD, a program director at the NIH s National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB). How can changing the firing rate of the same neurons in one region lead to different effects on the rest of the brain? Further experiments suggested the different effects may be due to a unique firing pattern by inhibitory neurons in a neighboring brain region, the zona incerta, during low frequency stimulation. Cells in this brain region have been shown to send inhibitory signals to cells in the sensory cortex. Electrical recordings showed that during low frequency stimulation of the central thalamus, zona incerta neurons fired in a spindle pattern that often occurs during sleep. In contrast, sleep spindles did not occur during high frequency stimulation. Moreover, when the scientists blocked the firing of the zona incerta neurons during low frequency stimulation of the central thalamus, the average activity of sensory cortex cells increased. Although deep brain stimulation of the thalamus has shown promise as a treatment for traumatic brain injury, patients who have decreased levels of consciousness show slow progress through these treatments.  We showed how the circuits of the brain can regulate arousal states,  said Dr. Lee.  We hope to use this knowledge to develop better treatments for brain injuries and other neurological disorders.

Using a visual test that is known to prompt different reactions in autistic and normal brains, a research team led by Caroline Robertson, a Junior Fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows, was able to show that those differences were associated with a breakdown in the signaling pathway used by GABA, one of the brain's chief inhibitory neurotransmitters. The study is described in a paper in Current Biology. ""This is the first time, in humans, that a neurotransmitter in the brain has been linked to autistic behavior - full stop,"" Robertson said. ""This theory that the GABA signaling pathway plays a role in autism has been shown in animal models, but until now we never had evidence for it actually causing autistic differences in humans."" Though it may not lead directly to autism treatments, Robertson said the finding does offer invaluable insight into the disorder and the role neurotransmitters like GABA may play in it. It also suggests that similar visual tests could be used to screen younger children for autism, allowing parents and clinicians to begin early intervention efforts sooner. Though long believed to play a role in autism (GABA has been widely studied in animal models) evidence supporting GABA's role in the disorder in humans has been elusive. ""Autism is often described as a disorder in which all the sensory input comes flooding in at once, so the idea that an inhibitory neurotransmitter was important fit with the clinical observations,"" Robertson said. ""In addition, people with autism often have seizures there is a 20 to 25 percent co-morbidity between autism and epilepsy and we think seizures are runaway excitation in the brain."" To find that evidence, Robertson and colleagues went searching for an easily replicable test that produced consistently different results in those with and without autism, and found it in what visual neuroscientists call binocular rivalry. Normally, she said, the brain is presented with two slightly different images one from each eye that it averages to create the single image we see everyday. The binocular rivalry test, however, forces each eye is take in very different images, with surprising results. ""The end result is that one image is just suppressed entirely from visual awareness for a short period,"" Robertson said. ""So if I show you a picture of a horse and an apple, the horse will entirely go away and you will just see the apple. Eventually, though, the neurons that are forcing that inhibitory signal get tired, and it will switch until you only see the horse. As that process repeats, the two images will rock back and forth."" In earlier studies, Robertson and colleagues showed that while the same process does occur in the autistic brain, the process of oscillating between images can take significantly longer. ""Where the average person might rock back and forth between the two images every three seconds, an autistic person might take twice as long,"" she said. ""They spend the same amount of time in the steady state where they see only one image as the average person, it just takes them longer to switch between them, and the second image is not as deeply suppressed."" Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a brain imaging technique that can measure the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, researchers found that while those with autism did show normal levels of excitatory neurotransmitters, GABA was far lower than expected. ""What we think we're seeing is evidence of a deficit in the GABA-ergic signaling pathway,"" Robertson said. ""It's not that there's no GABA in the brain...it's that there's some step along that pathway that's broken."" Fixing that pathway, however, is easier said than done. ""It's very diverse,"" Robertson said. ""There are two forms of GABA receptors, A and B, and the GABA A receptor can take multiple forms. We may be able to use this test to look at the effectiveness of drugs to give us a better idea about which of those receptors isn't working properly, but it's very complex. ""If these findings hold true in children as well as adults...right now we cannot diagnose autism in children who cannot speak, but that's when early intervention would be most effective,"" she continued. ""But before children can talk they can see, so we may be able to use this type of visual task to screen children and see if there's something imbalanced in their brain."" Robertson warned, however, that understanding the signaling pathway for GABA won't be a cure-all for autism. ""I'm excited about this study, but there are many other molecules in the brain, and many of them may be associated with autism in some form,"" she said. ""We were looking at the GABA story, but we're not done screening the autistic brain for other possible pathways that may play a role. But this is one, and we feel good about this one.""

Like the circuits in a computer, these neuronal circuits must be connected in particular ways to function properly. But with billions of neurons in a single human brain, how does a neuron make the right connections with the right cells? Biologists have long searched for some kind of cellular ""identification tags"" that label which cells should form connections. Now, researchers from the laboratory of Caltech professor of biology Kai Zinn have identified molecules that act like identification tags on neurons in the fruit fly Drosophila. They discovered that proteins from two different molecular subfamilies, called Dpr and DIP proteins, bind together selectively. This binding can cause neurons that express Dpr proteins to form connections with neurons that express the corresponding DIP protein, playing an important role in directing the development of the neuromuscular and visual systems in growing Drosophila. A paper detailing the findings is published in the journal Cell. In 2013, a collaboration between Christopher Garcia's structural biology group at Stanford and the Zinn group at Caltech mapped the interactions between all 200 different Drosophila cell surface proteins. By separating the proteins from the cell and observing their interactions in a test tube, the group determined which proteins bind together. The group developed a complex model of interacting proteins they called the interactome. This work showed that a 21-member subfamily of ""immunoglobulin superfamily"" proteins, the Dprs, selectively bind to a 9-member subfamily called DIPs. Expression of A) Dpr11 (green) and B) DIP-g (green) in the fly optic lobe. Each Dpr and DIP is expressed in a unique subset of neurons and layers within the optic lobe. Credit: Kaushiki Menon / Caltech ""Certain members of the Dprs and the DIPs match up and bind together kind of like a lock and key in a test tube,"" says Zinn. ""We wanted to know if they would bind in vivo, in the Drosophila brain, and if that binding would then determine where synapses were formed."" ""We wanted to know if these interacting proteins on the surface of neuronal cells affected the way that the cells themselves interacted,"" says Robert Carrillo, a postdoctoral scholar in the Zinn group and co-first author on the new paper. ""We showed that neural cells that expressed matching proteins often formed synapses with each other, and we theorized that the interaction between these molecules was driving the formation of synapses."" To test this theory, the Zinn group used the well-studied Drosophila visual system to determine the effects of these proteins on development. Neurons in the fly's eye send axons into layered structures in the visual part of the brain, the optic lobe. One of these structures, the medulla, is divided into ten layers, and each optic lobe neuron forms synapses within a specific subset of these layers. By removing certain DIP and Dpr proteins in the fly pupa, the researchers caused the axons to ""overshoot"" their target layers. Additionally, they observed developmental defects in the fly's neuromuscular system when removing the same proteins. Another paper in the same issue of Cell, from Larry Zipursky's group at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), also found that expression of Dprs and DIPs correlates with the patterns of synaptic connectivity in the brain.

The molecular basis for their interactions lies in their hydrophobic interfaces and these interactions control nervous system development and synaptic connectivity at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and the optic lobe. Credit: Robert Carrillo, Kaushiki Menon, Engin Ozkan  This finding helps to validate a theory proposed in the 1950s by the late Caltech professor and Nobel Laureate Roger Sperry. Experimenting mostly with fish and frog brains, Sperry discovered that he could manipulate or cut axons between neurons, and the cells would still re-form the right connections. ""Sperry hypothesized that individual neurons must carry some kind of identification tags, whose recognition is used to create the synaptic circuits of the brain,"" says Kaushiki Menon, a senior postdoctoral scholar in the Zinn group and a co-first author on the paper. ""Our group has shown that the Drosophila Dpr and DIP proteins fit the definition of Sperry's proposed cellular identification tags."" Such tinkering with the brain's circuitry is possible because flies, unlike humans, have brains that are predominantly ""hard-wired."" ""In mammals, the brain has a basic initial scaffold laid down by genetics, and then over time there is a lot of complicated experience-dependent rearrangement. Essentially, the brain can rewire itself through experience,"" Zinn says. ""Fly brains can't do that."" While their findings are not immediately generalizable to mammals, Zinn and his group hope that they can provide a starting point to probe the structure of the human brain. ""We hope that there might be protein networks that function similarly in humans, and these could be relevant to an understanding of how the scaffold of the human brain that exists at birth is assembled through genetics.""

Injury to the brain stimulates the production of new neurons, but these new cells are sometimes hyperexcitable, disrupting neural circuits and causing recurring seizures, researchers with UT Southwestern s Texas Institute for Brain Injury and Repair report in Nature Communications. Effectively stopping the process in genetically modified mice resulted in fewer seizures. In addition, eliminating the development of new neurons appeared to reduce cognitive decline and impairment of memory, common effects of seizures.  Understanding the mechanisms that promote aberrant neurogenesis caused by traumatic brain injury and subsequent seizures may open new therapeutic avenues to prevent epilepsy and associated memory problems caused by impact,  said senior author Dr. Jenny Hsieh, Associate Professor of Molecular Biology and a member of the UT Southwestern Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine. Halting development of new neurons resulted in a roughly 40 percent reduction in seizure frequency in the mice, but did not alter the duration of individual seizures. However, the researchers found that stopping neurogenesis before the development of seizures had a long-lasting effect, suppressing chronic seizure frequency for nearly one year, even at a late stage of the disease. An estimated 3 million Americans and 65 million people worldwide currently live with epilepsy, costing an estimated $15.5 billion annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Traumatic brain injury accounts for 20 percent of epileptic seizures, but how or why recurring seizures develop after a severe brain injury has thus far been unclear. Some drugs can help control seizures, but there is no drug to prevent or cure epilepsy. Degenerative diseases of the heart, brain, and other tissues represent the largest cause of death and disability in the world, affecting virtually everyone over the age of 40 and accounting for the lion s share of health care costs. Regenerative medicine represents a new frontier in science, which seeks to understand the mechanistic basis of tissue aging, repair, and regeneration and to leverage this knowledge to improve human health.

Sometimes the analyte interacts non-specifically with the sensor chip as well. In the SPR world, this is called non-specific binding (NSB), as the purpose of SPR experiments is to measure only the interaction between the analyte and the ligand, and not the background. NSB is caused by molecular forces (charge interactions, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, etc) between the analyte and the sensor surface. In order to test for NSB, a preliminary binding test with only the bare sensor (sensor without the ligand) and the analyte should be completed. If there is significant response when the analyte is passed over the bare sensor (false positive), do not stress, as there are a variety of steps you can take to reduce NSB for SPR experiments. Before you get started, it is important to know the profile of your analyte, for example, the isoelectric point, charge, size and the composition (hydrophilic, hydrophobic), so you can choose the best method possible for reducing NSB. The most common methods to prevent NSB can be found below.Example of the reduction of charge non-specific binding with the addition of 200 mM NaCl. Red curves represent non-specific binding from various analyte concentrations. Black curves represent the corresponding response of analyte with the addition of salt to running buffer. For a detailed experimental analysis of these methods, download our technote.  1) Adjust your pHThe pH of the buffer you are using for SPR experiments can have a significant impact on non-specific binding because it dictates whether your biomolecule has an overall positive or negative charge. For example, if you are using a pH at which your protein (analyte) is positively charged and the sensor surface is negatively charged, you can definitely expect to see non-specific charge interactions. You can fix this problem by preparing a buffer with a pH within the isoelectric point range (predicted neutral overall charge) of your protein. 2) Use Additives   Protein BlockerIf you are using a protein as your analyte, you can always try using bovine serum albumin (BSA) in your buffer and samples to help prevent non-specific binding. BSA is a globular protein with hydrophilic and hydrophobic subgroups which can surround your protein to protect it from binding to other proteins, charged surfaces, glass and plastic. Try to keep your BSA concentration at 1% or lower. Additives such as BSA and tween are used in most experiments not only to prevent non-specific binding but also to prevent analyte loss to the tubing walls at low concentrations. 3) Use Surfactants   Tween 20In non-specific binding occurring due to hydrophobic interactions in your system? Low concentrations of mild detergents such as Tween 20 can disrupt hydrophobic interactions between your analyte and sensor. Tween 20 is commonly added to biological systems to prevent the analyte from binding to tubing and containers as well. 4) Increase salt concentration (NaCl)Using higher salt concentrations in your buffer and sample can reduce non-specific binding due to charge interactions by producing a shielding effect. Salts such as NaCl prevent charges on the protein from interacting with charges on the surface. For example, adding 200 mM NaCl to the running buffer and samples can disrupt the charge interactions between a protein and carboxyl surface to reduce NSB binding completely. Preventing non-specific binding (if it exists) is key when performing surface plasmon resonance experiments. The more you know about the biological constituents of your system, the easier optimizing for NSB will be. It is also important to note that certain extreme conditions might deactivate or denature your biomolecules. For example, NSB might be completely eliminated at pH 10, but your protein might denature under those conditions, so you would have to adjust the conditions further. However, the complete elimination of non-specific binding is not always necessary if the quantity of specific binding is much greater than the signal of NSB. by Tijana Matovic, Nicoya Lifesciences","Published: December 18, 2015"

It will allow researchers to analyse data more quickly, efficiently, and on a larger scale than was previously possible.  The HPC and cloud facility is designed to empower the scientific community by making available to them a modern IT infrastructure that will enable analysis of huge volumes of genetics and other molecular data from human samples. This will help to accelerate translational research while also providing the basis for the implementation of customised medicine programmes for patients (where medical decisions, practices, and/or products are tailored to the individual patient).  Three organisations have worked together to fund and create Rosalind: NIHR Guy's and St Thomas' Biomedical Research Centre; NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre; and King s College London. All three organisations are part of King s Health Partners Academic Health Sciences Centre. Substantial funding was also provided by Guy s and St Thomas  Charity and the Maudsley Charity.  Powerful technology and infrastructure is needed to ensure that the vast quantity of data being generated by research projects across the country can be managed effectively and understood.  Big data  projects are now being generated from sources as diverse as clinical records, wearable technology, social networks, and brain imaging studies. The speed, versatility, and increased capacity of Rosalind is set to enhance research in the UK across a wide range of disciplines.  Professor Graham Lord, Director of the BRC at Guy s and St Thomas , comments:  Quick and early diagnosis of diseases is an important aim of our research. Rosalind breaks new ground by helping us analyse greater volumes of genomics data than ever before.  Over the last five years there have been tremendous improvements in technology which mean we are now able to scale volumes of genomics data being collected. Before Rosalind, if we wanted to analyse the data from 500 DNA samples it would have taken us approximately six months, now with the launch of Rosalind it will take only a week.    The work undertaken by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins at King s College London and Watson and Crick at Cambridge was fundamental to understanding the structure of DNA.  The molecule s structure was key to appreciating its role encoding the blueprint for life, and it is fitting that this system   which will help researchers to better understand that encoded information   is named after one of the pioneers of the genetic era.  Michael Luck, Executive Dean of the Faculty of Natural and Mathematical Sciences at King s College London says: ""In addition to research in health, this new facility provides a resource to cover research activity in basic sciences, including the simulation of materials, the computational modelling of biomolecular phenomena, and bioinformatics and big data research more generally. This will be an asset for fundamental data-driven research in physics, chemistry, computer science, engineering and mathematics."" Professor Matthew Hotopf, Director of the South London and Maudsley BRC, adds:  The launch of Rosalind is the result of an extraordinary collaboration between some of London s leading academic and health organisations.  This collaboration will enable us to break new ground in health research   Rosalind gives us the capacity to analyse an unprecedented range and volume of clinical data, from the individual molecules present in a patient s blood or DNA, to long-term data on their physical and mental health.   The result is research projects which span the entire journey from basic clinical research to effective treatments for patients   and the unique partnership of organisations involved in this project means that we will be doing so quicker, smarter, and more efficiently than ever before.

Also cancer cells depend on their properties to survive and spread throughout the body. Now scientists at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have successfully developed a small, highly active molecule that binds to a specific integrin which operates in many types of cancer. In the future it may allow patient-specific diagnoses and subsequent targeted treatment of tumor cells. Integrins are among the most important links between a cell and its outside world. They are found on the surface of cells and anchor them to other cells or substances in the space between cells, the so-called  extracellular matrix.  This direct contact not only holds cells within their groups, it also allows them to receive signals from the environment and react to them   for example, by growing, dividing or leaving a group. When a special protein in the extracellular matrix, a so-called ligand, bonds to an integrin, various signal cascades are initiated inside the cell. Without integrins cells would be  blind ,  deaf  and  dumb    and, as such, hardly able to survive. The aim: characterizing cancer cells But cancer cells deploy integrins for their very own purposes. They use them to break loose from tumor tissue, penetrate blood vessels and ultimately lodge themselves into other tissue as metastases in the lungs or bones, for example. However, precisely which of the many integrin subtypes is at work is very individual and can vary from patient to patient.  If we knew which integrin subtypes are active in the specific cancer of a given patient, we could attack these using appropriate active agents,  explains Tobias Kapp, doctoral candidate in Professor Horst Kessler s workgroup at the TUM Institute for Advanced Study and the TUM Department of Chemistry.  For this we need compounds that attach to a single integrin as specifically as possible.  Now Kessler, Kapp and his colleague Dr. Oleg Maltsev have successfully developed just such a ligand: A ring-shaped compound, which attaches to the alphaVbeta6 integrin, that appears in many different kinds of cancer and also plays a large role in fibroses. A promising active agent The new molecule fulfills many requirements of a potential medical agent. It selectively docks only to the alphaVbeta6 integrin   an important prerequisite for the future deployment as a medication with only minimal side effects. In addition, it attaches to most of the alphaVbeta6 integrins even at relatively low concentrations, making it effective even in small doses. It is also durable due to its cyclical structure and, in contrast to integrin ligands found in nature, breaks down only slowly in blood plasma. The new ligand has one more important characteristic in store: One of its amino acids, a lysine, can be used as a  hitch  for docking other substances to the compound.  This is of great significance if you want to use the ligands as a diagnostic tool,  explains Kapp.  For example, you can then dock substances that can be made visible using medical imaging equipment.  In this way tumors can be characterized and then fought using very specifically targeted therapies. If successful, this would represent a great advance in contrast with conventional cancer therapies, which are usually very broadly applied and thus also damage healthy cells. Step by step to the optimal binding partner The scientists used a protein of the foot-and-mouth disease virus as a template for the ligand. This natural alphaVbeta6 ligand uses an alpha-helical structure to bind to the integrin. The researchers reconstructed the helix using a small ring structure comprising nine amino acids. Using a multi-stage selection process they tested numerous variants until the most suitable molecule was identified. They used a proprietarily developed new technology in which the side chain of the amino acid arginine is used as a kind of molecular switch. This influences which integrin subtype the ligand attaches to with high selectivity. ""We now know the form of the lock and we know how to make the matching key,"" says Professor Kessler. ""This opens the door to a personalized medicine with which we can take patient-specific action against tumor cells.""","Published: December 18, 2015"

Millions of people are at risk of HAT which is usually fatal if untreated, with patients falling into a coma before death. Around 5,000 cases are reported each year, with severe social and economic costs, and some areas at risk remain uncovered by surveillance and control efforts. The disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (T.b. gambiense) and spread by the bite of infected tsetse flies. Existing tests rely on extracts directly from the dangerous parasite, but now scientists at the University of Kent have designed a way of making material more easily and safer, and therefore more cheaply. The next generation test was developed by Dr Barrie Rooney and Professor Mark Smales with colleagues from the University of Kent, funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) to work with international medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) as part of the BBSRC Flexible Interchange Programme (FLIP). Dr Rooney said:  In 14 months we have gone from idea to validation of this new rapid diagnostic test.  I have been involved with MSF mobile HAT screening teams in central African countries for over 10 years. Traditional testing involves a large team in remote areas doing time consuming microscopic work, and painful lumbar punctures. For this you need electricity and refrigeration.  By combining the latest genome databases and old fashioned fermentation techniques we have come up with a fast, simple way of making robust and reliable tests. The new tests are designed to be heat stable and user-friendly like a dipstick pregnancy test.  It will be a major improvement for screening and treatment of this deadly disease and speed us on the way to  the elimination of sleeping sickness as a public health hazard  which is a World Health Organisation target.  The researchers were able to genetically engineer a parasite similar to T.b. gambiense, but which is safe and easy to grow, to produce antigens for HAT. These antigens bind to molecules in blood samples of patients infected with HAT, allowing the disease to be detected. As well as being easy to carry out, fewer people will be needed to administer the tests and they take half as long to conduct as the traditional methods. Professor Melanie Welham, BBSRC Executive Director, Science, said:  This is a brilliant example of exactly what the FLIP scheme is all about. FLIP funding allowed Dr Rooney to work with the University of Kent and MSF to design and develop this test in just 14 months.  The promise and potential impact of this new diagnostic is obvious and I wish Dr Rooney success in the forthcoming work in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  FLIP brings scientists into different environments where they can learn new skills and exploit their existing expertise in new collaborations, enhancing the impact of bioscience research.  In July Dr Rooney traveled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to identify areas where field trials of the new rapid diagnostic test could be carried out, alongside an MSF HAT mobile team conducting screening and treatment. Although the test has been developed for HAT, the method has potential to develop diagnostics for other similar tropical diseases such as Chagas disease and visceral leishmaniasis.","Published: December 18, 2015"

The survey amongst key companies in Spain s pharma supply and manufacturing sectors shows that, despite recent falls in overall value, the country s manufacturers are now targeting increased FDI and exports   primarily to Latin America and Europe, but also increasing to the USA. CPhI Worldwide is a global hub for insight and analysis and is increasing the key barometer of the industry s future direction and health. Following the event, we have summarized the hot topics and emerging trends in Spain. Some 36,368 professionals and 2490 exhibitors attended CPhI Worldwide in Madrid, and thanks to this success, and renewed buoyancy in the Spanish market, the event will return in Barcelona for 2016   home to a thriving biotech and manufacturing cluster ripe for investment. One of the main growth opportunities to emerge from the surveys is that Spain retains an enormous amount of early stage innovations, but has until recently lacked the capital to take these into development and commercialization. However, with the easing of financial conditions from  la crisis , and initiatives to encourage local and international funding we should see more projects moving into later stage work. For example, the Spanish Bioindustry Association (ASEBIO) stated it is now working towards helping establish  fiscal incentives  for innovation and is encouraging the Government to create  centres of excellence  to fully capitalize on the market s potential. Another notable trend reported is that as the overall domestic market shrank, generic exports have continued to grow rapidly (30-40%) over the last 5-years. This trend is forecast to continue, as by European and US standards, manufacturing and labour costs remain highly competitive. Led by the successful international sales from companies like Esteve, Grifols and Gropo, a new wave of SMEs are targeting exports to Europe and Latin America. Whilst some of the longer established companies, with FDA approved GMP sites, are also looking to gain increased traction in the United States. Farmaindustria, the national association for the pharmaceutical industry, states opportunities are uneven between national and multinational providers. The director general, Humberto Arn s, added:  Our national companies are related in terms of their geographical reach   Europe being the most important [currently]   and there is still much work to do in internalizing them. The industry needs to generate trust from investors to build a predictable Spanish market and export platform. But Spain is well positioned to grow.  Next year at CPhI Worldwide in Barcelona, a new collated event in Finished Dosage Formulation (FDF)will launch and is designed to bring the entire supply chain together in one global location, from Big Pharma and CMO, to out-licensing specialists, end product distributors, end-user agents, and home markets. In fact, the CPhI findings highlighted that Life Science investment in Barcelona has doubled in recent years and nearly half of all R&D in Spain is located in the region. Across the APIs and intermediates market, companies are also reporting increased confidence in sales growth, particularly for products beyond the $100/Kg threshold, with oncology and high potents attracting the attention of many manufacturers. Overall, the market remains somewhat ambivalent about generics, with price referencing forcing patented products to match the price of generics on introduction to the market, which is providing significant marginal problems for both product classes. However, in the longer term, with less than 50% of pharmaceutical volumes (38%) and only 18% of value, clearly generics represent a major area of future growth to bring Spain inline with other major European nations   whose use of generics, by volume, averages 55% (25% average by value). This revenue expansion opportunity is also being strongly supported by generic manufacturers moving towards exports and new markets, where there are less price restrictions.  We have held several successful CPhI events in Spain over the last decade, but the sense of optimism and opportunities in the local and international market this year was particularly noticeable. Spain, as our survey notes, is split into two key pharma hubs and its hugely exciting to be moving to Barcelona next year - a region we feel is primed to become increasingly significant within the industry. What s more, with the growth in finished formulation dosages, it was also the ideal time to introduce a new dedicated zone, more details of which will be announced in the New Year.

The results, gained through collaboration with the University of Chicago and detailed in a  recently published paper, highlight data made possible with X-ray Absorption Fine Structure spectroscopy performed at the Advanced Photon Source. The APS is a DOE Office of Science User Facility at Argonne National Laboratory.  Despite the low concentration of uranium and the presence of many other metals extracted from seawater, we were able to investigate the local atomic environment around uranium and better understand how it is bound by the polymer fibers,  Abney said. Surprisingly, the spectrum for the seawater-contacted polymer fibers was distinctly different from what was expected based on small molecule and computational investigations. Researchers concluded that for this system the approach of studying small molecule structures and assuming that they accurately represent what happens in a bulk material simply doesn t work. It is necessary to consider large-scale behavior to obtain the complete picture, highlighting the need for developing greater computational capabilities, according to Abney.  This challenges the long-held assumption regarding the validity of using simple molecular-scale approaches to determine how these complex adsorbents bind metals,  Abney said.  Rather than interacting with just one amidoxime, we determined multiple amidoximes would have to cooperate to bind each uranium molecule and that a second metal that isn t uranium also participates in forming this binding site.  An amidoxime is the chemical group attached to the polymer fiber responsible for binding uranium. Abney and colleagues plan to use this knowledge to design adsorbents that can harness the vast reserves of uranium dissolved in seawater. The payoff promises to be significant.  Nuclear power production is anticipated to increase with a growing global population, but estimates predict only 100 years of uranium reserves in terrestrial ores,  Abney said.  There is approximately 1,000 times that amount dissolved in the ocean, which would meet global demands for the foreseeable future. ","Published: December 18, 2015"

The lopsided ratios we found in the expression of two parts of the mRNA, one that carries the code for a protein and one that doesn t, do not appear to occur randomly,  says senior author Mary Hynes, a research associate professor.  We suspect some of these skewed ratios may act as a mechanism for regulating protein production, particularly during embryonic development but also in the adult.  The researchers  results focus on regions within messenger RNA, which is transcribed directly from a gene then translated into protein. After transcription, each mRNA molecule possesses in its middle a coding sequence, the instructions from which the protein will be made. The coding sequence is flanked by two sections that do not go on to make protein: the 3  untranslated region (UTR) and the 5  UTR, the names of which derive from the sugar backbone. It has long been assumed that all three stick together within a single mRNA molecule.Using a technique developed at Rockefeller called translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP), Hynes  team isolated purified mRNA from dopamine neurons of embryonic mice. With a browser that shows the region of an mRNA that is expressed, they made the surprising observation that a number of genes in dopamine neurons showed abundant expression of 3 UTR mRNA sequences and little to no expression of the coding region of these mRNAs. This was true, for instance, of two genes in the Sox family, Sox11 and Sox12, which are known to help determine the fate of cells during development. This contradicted the common thinking that once an mRNA is transcribed from a gene the 5  and 3  UTRs and the coding regions act as a unit until protein is produced and the mRNA is degraded. An earlier study had noted similar disparities, but did not explore the biological implications and its data did not get widespread attention. Hynes and her colleagues took the next step, asking: Why then would a cell make abundant levels of 3  UTR sequence and no coding sequence, since protein cannot be made without the coding sequence? To verify the findings and understand if this was restricted to dopamine neurons, development, or the nervous system, the team used green probes to mark coding sequences and red to mark the 3  UTRs of 19 genes in embryonic and adult tissue.  Based on prior understanding, it was expected that every cell in the tissue should show up as either yellow, when both are expressed, or black, when neither are,  Hynes says.  But to our surprise, when we examined Sox11 mRNA in the brain we found many neurons that were red, or expressing mostly UTR, as well as many that were green, or expressing mostly coding sequences.  They went on to show that this was true for every gene they examined and that differential expression of UTR and coding sequences occurs in the embryo, in the adult, and outside of the nervous system. Even widely expressed genes such as beta actin, a protein necessary for cell movement and structure, show differences in UTR and coding sequence expression, they found. When they took protein expression into account, they found that the higher the ratio of expression of 3  UTR to coding sequence, the lower the level of protein suggesting high levels of 3  UTR might be somehow involved in turning down the dial on protein production. However, it s not clear how this might happen, Hynes says. Next, they focused back on the developing dopamine neurons, and the nine thousand genes they found were active in them. With help from the New York Genome Center, they compared the biological functions of genes with a high UTR-to-coding sequence ratio against those with comparable ratios. Many of the high-UTR genes turned out to play roles specifically in development, while the genes with comparable ratios were more often involved in generic cellular processes.  During development a neuron may need to express a certain gene, but only a particular amount of it. Either too much or too little might be harmful and lead to irreversible fate changes. So, we think this could be a mechanism for finely titrating the proteins levels from an active gene,  Hynes says. Because studies of RNA expression can rely on sequences within the UTRs, the coding sections, or both, they may potentially be losing essential information, she says.  Going forward, I think that when an RNA sequencing  experiment suggests that a gene is highly expressed, researchers will want to take a closer look at the relative levels of these two components to get a more accurate picture of what is being expressed.

We have found the mechanism that makes patients react against components of their own blood vessels even before receiving an organ transplant, and we have identified a drug that can prevent this type of rejection,  said Dr. Marie-Jos e H bert, a transplant physician and researcher at the CRCHUM and a professor at the university's Department of Medicine. The findings were published today in Science Translational Medicine Rejection is a risk of transplantation. The phenomenon is usually caused by a reaction of the recipient's immune system vis- -vis the transplant, which it considers an invader. HLAs (human leucocyte antigens), which are present on the surface of all cells, are a sort of unique identifier for each person. In transplants, doctors try to avoid rejection by ensuring that the donor and recipient are compatible with regard to blood group and HLA antigens. Despite these precautions, one in ten transplants results in rejection. To solve this mystery, the researchers focused on blood vessels, an important component in transplantation. When blood vessels are damaged, rejection is more difficult to treat.  We discovered that the damaged blood vessels release specific bits of cells: small membrane vesicles that put the immune system on alert. If we then perform a transplant, the immune system immediately attacks the donor organ,  said Melanie Dieud , a researcher at the CRCHUM and first author of the study. The tiny vesicles derive from dying cells and produce autoantibodies.  In addition to the immune system reacting against HLAs, it surprisingly reacts against components of our own cells. So rejection is not simply a reaction against another person, it is also a reaction against elements that belong to us,  said Dr. H bert, who is also Co-director of the Canadian National Transplant Research Program. Dr. H bert's team has found a way to neutralize the enzyme driver of these small vesicles, the proteasome, through a drug currently used to treat certain cancers of the bone marrow, bortezomib. The drug acts by blocking the enzyme activity of the vesicles, which has the effect of making the immune system deaf to alerts. Results from cultured cells and animal models are promising, and a clinical study in humans is ongoing.  If a recipient has already reacted to these small vesicles and receives an organ that is also in the process of releasing vesicles, it is probably a dangerous situation. This is what we are still examining,  explained H bert. Since the first organ transplant in 1954 by Dr. Joseph Murray in Boston, transplants have improved. Research on the compatibility of blood groups and HLA antigens before transplantation, and the development of treatments to combat rejection, such as corticosteroids, x-rays, and immunosuppressants, have enabled doctors to perform transplants that have saved lives. This latest discovery could help save more.  It is still too early to consider changing clinical guidelines, but I think it could one day change how organs are allocated for transplants. Organ recipients could also be treated before the operation to make them more silent to these signals coming from ourselves,"" concluded H bert.","Published: December 18, 2015"

The reports are the latest in a recent series of developments toward custom-designing proteins. Naturally occurring proteins are the nanoscale machines that carry out nearly all the essential functions in living things. While it has been known for more than 40 years that a protein's sequence of amino acids determines its shape, it has been challenging for scientists to predict a protein's three-dimensional structure from its amino acid sequence. Conversely, it has been difficult for scientists to devise brand new amino acid sequences that fold up into hitherto unseen structures. A protein's structure dictates the types of biochemical and biological tasks it can perform. The Nature papers look at one type of natural construction: proteins formed of repeat copies of a structural component. The researchers examined the potential for creating new types of these proteins. Just as the manufacturing industry was revolutionized by interchangeable parts, originating protein molecules with the right twists, turns and connections for their modular assembly would be a bold direction for biotechnology. The papers are 'Exploring the repeat protein universe through computational design' and 'Rational design of alpha-helical tandem repeat proteins with closed architecture.' The findings suggest the possibilities for producing useful protein geometries that exceed what nature has achieved. The work was led by postdoctoral fellows TJ Brunette, Fabio Parmeggiani and Po-Ssu Huang in David Baker's lab at the University of Washington, and Lindsey Doyle and Phil Bradley at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute in Seattle. In addition, over the past several months, researchers at the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington, the Fred Hutch, and their colleagues at other institutions have described several other advances in two long-standing problem areas in building new proteins from scratch. ""It has been a watershed year for protein structure predictions and design,"" said UW Medicine researcher David A. Baker, UW professor of biochemistry, Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, and head of the UW Institute for protein design. The protein structure problem is figuring out how a protein's chemical makeup predetermines its molecular structure, and in turn, its biological role. UW researchers have developed powerful algorithms to make unprecedented, accurate, blind predictions about the structure of large proteins of more than 200 amino acids in length. This has opened the door to predicting the structures for hundreds of thousands of recently discovered proteins in the ocean, soil, and gut microbiome. Equally difficult is designing amino acid sequences that will fold into brand new protein structures. Researchers have now shown the possibility of doing this with precision for protein folds inspired by naturally occurring proteins. More importantly, researchers can now devise amino acid sequences to fashion novel, previously unknown folds, far surpassing what is predicted to occur in the natural world. The new proteins are designed with help from volunteers around the globe participating in the Rosetta@home distributed computing project. The custom-designed amino acid sequences are encoded in synthetic genes, the proteins are produced in the laboratory, and their structures are revealed through X-ray crystallography. The computer models in almost all cases match the experimentally determined crystal structures with near atomic level accuracy. Researches have also reported new protein designs, all with near atomic level accuracy, for such shapes as barrels, sheets, rings and screws. This adds to previous achievements in designing protein cubes and spheres, and suggests the possibility of making a totally new class of protein materials. By furthering advances such as these, researchers hope to build proteins for critical tasks in medical, environmental and industrial arenas. Examples of their goals are nanoscale tools that: boost the immune response against HIV and other recalcitrant viruses, block the flu virus so that it cannot infect cells, target drugs to cancer cells while reducing side effects, stop allergens from causing symptoms, neutralize deposits, called amyloids, thought to damage vital tissues in Alzheimer's disease, mop up medications in the body as an antidote, and fulfill other diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Scientists are also interested in new proteins for biofuels and clean energy. In addition to this week's report on modular construction of proteins with repeating motifs, here are some other recent developments:  Evolution offers clues to shaping proteins: The function of many proteins tends to stay the same across species, even after their amino acid sequences have changed over billions of years of evolution. Locating co-evolved pairs of amino acids helps calculate their proximity when the molecule folds. UW graduate student Sergey Ovchinnikov applied this co-evolution DNA sequence analysis in an E-Life paper published Sept. 3, 2015, 'Large-scale determination of previously unsolved protein structures using evolutionary information.' The effort illuminated for the first time the structures of 58 families of proteins that have hundreds of thousands of additional, structurally related family members. ""This achievement was a grand slam home run in the history of protein structure prediction,"" said Baker.  Barrel-fold design: Baker lab postdoctoral fellow Po-Ssu Huang, together with Birte H cker at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Germany discovered the elusive design principles for a barrel-shaped fold underpinning many natural enzyme molecules. The custom designed barrels folds, built at the Institute for Protein Design, were presented Nov. 23, 2015 in the Nature Chemical Biology paper, 'De novo design of a four-fold symmetric TIM-barrel protein with atomic-level accuracy.' This achievement has opened the door for bioengineers to generate totally new enzymes that speed up chemical reactions by positioning smaller molecules in custom barrel compartments.  Self-assembling apparatus: Ordered protein arrays along a flat plane are found in bacteria, the heart, and other muscles. Overcoming protein interaction complexities, researchers at UW Institute for Protein Design and the Janelia Research Campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute programmed proteins to self-assemble into novel symmetric, 2-dimensional sheets of protein lattice patterns. UW graduate student Shane Gonen in the Baker lab, with his brother Tamir Gonen at Janelia, described their work in the June 19, 2015 issue of Science, 'Design of ordered two-dimensional arrays mediated by non-covalent protein-protein interfaces.' This research has applications for self-assembling protein nanomaterials, especially efficient sensors or light harvesters.  Precision sculpting: Protein designers are continuously refining principles for fashioning ideal protein structures. A paper in the Oct. 6, 2015, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 'Control over overall shape and size in de novo designed proteins', further explains methods for systematically varying protein architecture inspired by nature. Such finesse could optimize designed proteins to take on the proper shapes for desired functions.

This study reveals an important stage and mechanism in HIV infection that was previously unappreciated,  said Dr. Brass, assistant professor of microbiology & physiological systems.  It s important to know more about these early infection events so we can come up with ways to stop the virus from becoming part of our DNA and infecting us for life.  The key to learning about HIV s intra-nuclear migration came thanks to a new technique, ViewHIV, which was developed by Brass and his colleagues, Jill Perreira and Chris Chin, both research associates at UMMS; and Eric Feeley, a PhD candidate at Duke University. Using ViewHIV, the researchers are able to closely monitor the migration of HIV, which is made up of a protein capsule or capsid that contains the virus s DNA, as it passes through the nuclear membrane and moves around inside the nucleus. Up to this point, scientists have been unable to generate good images of HIV inside the nucleus using standard techniques. Because of this limitation, most insights into HIV s transit across the nuclear membrane have been gained through indirect molecular biology and biochemistry methods that evaluate large cell populations.  There are certain characteristics of a virus you can only learn about by keeping it intact and seeing it in action in single cells,  said Perreira, a co-lead author on the study.  Researchers have been studying HIV for 30 years, but we still didn t have a really good way to look inside infected cells. We thought that if we could just see what s going on, then we could get a better idea of what the virus is doing and how to stop it.  To take a look inside HIV-infected cells, the team developed ViewHIV. Adapted from existing technologies, ViewHIV is capable of generating images of both the viral genome and protein capsid simultaneously inside an infected host cell. ViewHIV pairs a very sensitive type of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a monoclonal antibody that binds to the viral capsid. The key, according to Brass, was using a protease in preparing the samples. This allowed the capsid, tagged with a fluorescent antibody, to be seen in the images of the nucleus. This technique allows scientists to visualize the movement and fate of the viral capsid, DNA and RNA inside the cell. Standard confocal microscopy is then used to take both horizontal and vertical photos of the cell that are re-assembled into detailed three-dimensional images of the cell. Perreira and Chin, using the images produced by ViewHIV, were able to track the virus and its capsid as it moved through the cytoplasm, across the nuclear membrane and finally into the nucleus where it permanently integrates into the host cell s DNA. By knocking down certain host proteins, the researchers were able to observe what impact these proteins had on the virus  ability to enter the nucleus and integrate into the host genome. They found that the viral capsid played an important role in the virus s ability to enter and navigate through the nucleus. Many studies hypothesized that HIV shed it protein capsid before it enters the nuclear pore complex. Brass s images clearly show that a portion of the capsid is still present and associated with the viral DNA after nuclear entry, with the final shedding of capsid occurring when the virus reaches its final destination. Further investigation showed that it is the capsid s use of the host proteinsCPSF6 and TNPO3 that allow it to enter and navigate through the nucleus. Without this help, the virus gets stranded outside or at the edge of the nucleus. The CPSF6 protein normally works to modify the cell s newly made messenger RNAs and its goal is to find active genes once it gets into the nucleus. Brass s study shows that when a cell is infected with HIV, the virus takes advantage of CPSF6 by hitching a ride on the protein, which is ferried across the nuclear membrane by the nuclear importer, TNPO3. Once inside the nucleus, HIV because it s bound to CPSF6  is carried to active gene areas where it prefers to integrate. In the absence of TNPO3, the virus is unable to cross the nuclear membrane. And without CPSF6, it is unable to find the active gene regions that it prefers for integration. Instead it integrates into less active regions. These findings point to a previously undescribed state in HIV s life cycle taking place between the time the virus enters the nucleus and the time its DNA is integrated into our genome, which was only discovered thanks to the development of ViewHIV.  We believe ViewHIV is going to be a great tool for unlocking the mechanisms that govern the early state of HIV s life cycle,  said Brass.  With our technique we can better determine how HIV establishes itself into our DNA and develop new ways to stop that from happening. ","Published: December 18, 2015"

This research may lead the way to a new tumour assessment method which could complement traditional approaches. Changes in metal distribution in the brain have been linked to the degree of malignancy of brain cancer. With results published in Spectrochimica Acta Part B, the researchers found that trace metals could be used to correctly identify cancerous tissue in over 99% of cases and effectively classify the cancer stage. The 4,000th paper to be published based on research carried out at Diamond, this work could have major implications for the early identification and treatment of brain tumours. Diamond s CEO, Andrew Harrison, comments:  I m delighted that Diamond s 4,000th paper so aptly demonstrates the impact that synchrotron research can have on people s lives. This work is still in its early stages but, in time, the discovery of the link between certain trace metals and their role in the growth of cancer cells could help to redefine the way we identify brain tumours, allowing for earlier diagnosis and, ultimately, a better chance for patients.  An international group of scientists from Poland, Austria and Diamond (UK) used a technique known as X-ray fluorescence which is commonly used to determine the presence of different elements within substances down to very low concentrations. Professor Marek Lankosz from AGH University of Science and Technology was principal investigator on the research. He explains:  When exposed to X-rays, elements fluoresce in certain ways: this allows us to determine what elements are present and where. The technique is commonly used in many fields, including space science, ecological and conservation work   but we have now shown that it could have hitherto unrecognized uses in the diagnosis of brain cancer and may provide a significant new clinical tool.  Using this technique, the group studied the relationship between trace metals in the brain and the development of cancerous tissue. By using metals as a guide, the scientists discovered that they were able to distinguish, in a non-destructive way, between homogeneous cancerous tissue and structures like blood vessels and calcifications. In addition to identifying the location of tumours, the group also found that trace metals could be used to help assess the malignancy of brain cancer cases. They discovered that in tissue with high grades of malignancy certain trace elements such as iron and calcium were less concentrated than in healthy tissue, whilst zinc was moreso. This means that the trace metals could be used as a biomarker to evaluate the intensity of brain tumours in patients. Professor Dariusz Adamek is a clinician and Head of Chair of Pathomorphology at Jagiellonian University. He comments:  These findings seem promising but it requires further investigations to truly understand the way in which these elements are involved in pathogenesis of tumours or hypothetically play a role as risk factors.   The inherent cellular, genetic and metabolic heterogeneity of these tumours means one has to be very cautious to draw any conclusions. There is definitely a long way ahead to true understanding of a role of trace elements in brain tumour biology. But somewhere and at rather the end of this way there lies possibility of practical clinical implementation of our discoveries in either diagnosis or treatment.  Dr Tina Geraki is a senior support scientist on one of Diamond s spectroscopy beamlines, I18, and one of the scientists involved in the research. She comments:  These findings can make an impact on our understanding of the changes in the brain associated with the mechanisms of malignancy. Our aim is to contribute to developing methods for tumour assessment that would be complementary to histopathological examination. ","Published: December 18, 2015"

This ability opens the door to make this fatal cancer treatable. Gliomas are brain tumors that arise from glial cells, which help nerve cells to stay connected and send signals throughout the body. Cancerous gliomas are uniformly fatal, with a median survival rate of 14 months from the time of diagnosis. But a new nanotechnology approach developed by Xiaoli Liu and Achuthamangalam Madhankumar in the Department of Neurosurgery could transform gliomas from a death sentence into a treatable condition. Patients diagnosed with a malignant glioma can undergo surgery, chemotherapy and radiation to destroy the tumor, but the cancer will return. ""Patients typically don't die from the tumor they initially presented with. Rather, they die from new tumors that come back in other parts of the brain,"" said James Connor, Distinguished Professor of Neurosurgery. These new gliomas tend to grow quickly and are often resistant to treatment because they spring from cancer cells that survived the first therapeutic assault. Glioma patients have follow-up MRIs to detect new brain cancers but the tests do not catch the tumors early enough to save lives. That is because contrast agents used to outline gliomas on an MRI can only pass the protective blood-brain barrier once the tumors have grown large enough to cause damage to the barrier. Until then, the blood-brain barrier blocks 98 percent of small molecules and all large molecules from entering the brain. To overcome this deadly limitation, Penn State researchers created ""smart fat cells"" called liposomes that can pass the blood-brain barrier in mice, seek out tiny cancerous gliomas like heat-seeking missiles and light them up on an MRI. The liposomes are loaded with the most commonly used contrast agent, Magnevist. On their surface, the liposomes are studded with proteins that target receptors on glioma cells. The new contrast agent delivery system is more sensitive than traditional contrast-enhanced MRI, Connor said. The researchers found that the liposomes entered the brain in healthy mice with uncompromised blood-brain barriers. Both the conventional and the new technique found large gliomas in mice with cancer, but only the liposome-encapsulated agent was able to detect smaller early-stage tumors. ""The goal is to be able to get down to detecting single cancer cells,"" Connor said. The study is published in Neuro-Oncology. It is not exactly known how the liposomes get past the intact blood-brain barrier, but they apparently do it without causing damage. In the study, mice showed no harm from the treatment. This novel approach is an alternative to ultrasound, another promising method researchers are studying to get therapeutic agents into the brain. Ultrasound, however,  causes temporary disruption to the blood-brain barrier, which allows not only the therapeutic agent to enter the brain, but also blood which could have medical implications. ""Ultrasound, with all of its good qualities, is disruptive to the blood-brain barrier, whereas we can get an agent to cross it without causing disruption."" Connor said. The researchers said that in the future, smart fat cells will deliver chemotherapeutic drugs, along with contrast agents, to brain tumor patients so that cancer cells can be detected and wiped out in one step. They recently presented research on these next-generation liposomes at the Society for Neuro-Oncology meeting in San Antonio.

But new research at The Rockefeller University suggests the molecule is up to something unexpected. By uncovering widespread disparities in the expression of components of mRNA molecules something assumed not to occur the scientists say they have found intriguing expression patterns that suggest unexpected functions for certain regions within mRNA molecules.  The lopsided ratios we found in the expression of two parts of the mRNA, one that carries the code for a protein and one that doesn t, do not appear to occur randomly,  says senior author Mary Hynes, a research associate professor.  We suspect some of these skewed ratios may act as a mechanism for regulating protein production, particularly during embryonic development but also in the adult.  Reported in the journal Neuron, the researchers  results focus on regions within messenger RNA, which is transcribed directly from a gene then translated into protein. After transcription, each mRNA molecule possesses in its middle a coding sequence, the instructions from which the protein will be made. The coding sequence is flanked by two sections that do not go on to make protein: the 3  untranslated region (UTR) and the 5  UTR, the names of which derive from the sugar backbone. It has long been assumed that all three stick together within a single mRNA molecule. Using a technique developed at Rockefeller called translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP), Hynes  team isolated purified mRNA from dopamine neurons of embryonic mice. With a browser that shows the region of an mRNA that is expressed, they made the surprising observation that a number of genes in dopamine neurons showed abundant expression of 3  UTR mRNA sequences and little to no expression of the coding region of these mRNAs. This was true, for instance, of two genes in the Sox family, Sox11 and Sox12, which are known to help determine the fate of cells during development. Similar red- or green-skewed patterns, evidence of disparities in the expression of 3 UTR sequences versus coding sequences, respectively, appeared for other genes and in other tissues. The image above shows the differential expression of components of mRNA for actin, a motility and structural protein in the chest region of a mouse embryo. Credit: Rockefeller University  This contradicted the common thinking that once an mRNA is transcribed from a gene the 5  and 3  UTRs and the coding regions act as a unit until protein is produced and the mRNA is degraded. An earlier study had noted similar disparities, but did not explore the biological implications and its data did not get widespread attention. Hynes and her colleagues took the next step, asking: Why then would a cell make abundant levels of 3  UTR sequence and no coding sequence, since protein cannot be made without the coding sequence? To verify the findings and understand if this was restricted to dopamine neurons, development, or the nervous system, the team used green probes to mark coding sequences and red to mark the 3  UTRs of 19 genes in embryonic and adult tissue.  Based on prior understanding, it was expected that every cell in the tissue should show up as either yellow, when both are expressed, or black, when neither are,  Hynes says.  But to our surprise, when we examined Sox11 mRNA in the brain we found many neurons that were red, or expressing mostly UTR, as well as many that were green, or expressing mostly coding sequences.  They went on to show that this was true for every gene they examined and that differential expression of UTR and coding sequences occurs in the embryo, in the adult, and outside of the nervous system. Even widely expressed genes such as beta actin, a protein necessary for cell movement and structure, show differences in UTR and coding sequence expression, they found. When they took protein expression into account, they found that the higher the ratio of expression of 3  UTR to coding sequence, the lower the level of protein suggesting high levels of 3  UTR might be somehow involved in turning down the dial on protein production. However, it s not clear how this might happen, Hynes says. Next, they focused back on the developing dopamine neurons, and the nine thousand genes they found were active in them. With help from the New York Genome Center, they compared the biological functions of genes with a high UTR-to-coding sequence ratio against those with comparable ratios. Many of the high-UTR genes turned out to play roles specifically in development, while the genes with comparable ratios were more often involved in generic cellular processes.  During development a neuron may need to express a certain gene, but only a particular amount of it. Either too much or too little might be harmful and lead to irreversible fate changes. So, we think this could be a mechanism for finely titrating the proteins levels from an active gene,  Hynes says. Because studies of RNA expression can rely on sequences within the UTRs, the coding sections, or both, they may potentially be losing essential information, she says.  Going forward, I think that when an RNA sequencing  experiment suggests that a gene is highly expressed, researchers will want to take a closer look at the relative levels of these two components to get a more accurate picture of what is being expressed.

To know how the brain works, they need to know not only what types of nerve cells exist, but also how they work together. Researchers at the Salk Institute have gotten one step closer to unlocking this black box. Using cutting-edge visualization and genetic techniques, the team uncovered a new subtype of nerve cell in the visual cortex. The group also detailed how the new cell and two similar neurons process images and connect to other parts of the brain. Learning how the brain analyzes visual information at such a detailed level may one day help doctors understand elements of disorders like schizophrenia and autism.  Understanding these cell types contributes another piece to the puzzle uncovering neural circuits in the brain, circuits that will ultimately have implications for neurological disorders,  says Edward Callaway, Salk professor and senior author of the paper published in the journal Neuron. Unlocking the detailed workings of the brain has been a slow-going challenge. Historically, scientists used stains to show that various neurons have distinct shapes, and are likely different types of cells. Yet, the true number of neuron types in the brain remains a mystery. Callaway compares the task of unraveling neuronal connectivity and function to intelligence surveillance. Twenty years ago, the technology to track connections between various neurons in the brain was about as sophisticated as filming a group of people on a city corner talking on cell phones: each person is talking to another, but the person on other end of the conversation may be a block away, or across the country. The content of the conversations would be impossible to deduce.  Similar to those cell phone conversations, each type of neuron is only connected to certain other types of neurons, but it could be a cell anywhere else in the brain,  says Callaway. New mouse models and other technology developed in the past five years offer mapping tools as powerful as phone-tapping surveillance, allowing scientists to track  what are the neuron types, which cell types are talking to each other, and what are they talking about,  he said. In their new paper, Callaway and colleagues chipped away at these questions by selectively genetically manipulating specific cell types in animal models to visualize the size, shape and electrical activity unique to individual types of neurons. The three neuron types the team studied are part of a larger classification of neurons called excitatory pyramidal (named for their shape) neurons, and play an important role across the cortex of the brain. Although all the experiments were done in the visual cortex of mice, the same neuron cell types likely exist and play similar roles in the brains of many animals, including humans.  Previously, people did not have very good tools to label, or look at, specific pyramidal cell types in the brains of awake mice. But using this cutting-edge visual technology, we could see the cell activity and how each cell type may process different kinds of information for different purposes,  said Euiseok Kim, first author of the Neuron paper and a Salk research associate. The Salk scientists used special imaging techniques to show how, and when, the three cell types were activated in response to different images shown to a living mouse. To trace the new cell s neural circuit, the team used a modified rabies virus method invented by Callaway s lab to map the connections between the three neuron types and cells in the rest of the brain. The combination of the two imaging tests painted a picture of the different neurons  functions. Two neuronal types that were sensitive to fine-detailed spatial information in the visual tests were also mapped to parts of the brain responsible for parsing various bits of information. Similarly, the neurons that responded to direction and speed in the visual tests were shown to connect differently to the parts of the brain in the rabies mapping experiment.  It s not an accident that a particular cell type responds to fast-moving stimuli because those neurons connect to a part of the brain that is responsible for controlling eye movement,  says Callaway, who also holds the Institute s Audrey Geisel Chair.  The outputs are matched to the function of the circuit.  Callaway expects future experiments will likely determine even more functions of these neurons.  Now that we have this understanding of these neurons, it leads to new hypotheses and new ideas about what the neurons are doing,  says Callaway.  We can set up new experiments with these cell types and see how it changes behavior in the mice.  Learning how cell types are connected and function under different circumstances can ultimately help explain what goes wrong in various conditions such as autism and schizophrenia.  The part of the brain we studied was the visual cortex, but the cell types we re looking at are also found in every other part of the cerebral cortex, such as areas involved in motor or cognitive functions,  Callaway adds.

It is expected to provide valuable information that may help preserve the iconic but imperiled tree.  Having the genome sequence allows us to discover the underlying genetic determinants of disease resistance, which will greatly facilitate reforestation efforts,  said professor and principal investigator David Neale, a UC Davis forest tree geneticist.  We can now give forest managers modern, rapid genetic tools to identify resistant trees.  Neale collaborated on the Pine Reference Sequences project with geneticist Charles Langley and bioinformatics researcher Kristian Stevens, both of UC Davis, as well as researchers from other universities and the U.S. Forest Service. The genome for the sugar pine has been publicly released and is available through open access at the Pine Reference Sequences website. Importance of sugar pines in California forests The sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) is one of the tallest tree species in the world. It is endemic primarily to California, stretching south into parts of Baja Mexico and north into Oregon. The stately tree s pinecones, averaging 10 to 20 inches in length, are among the longest of any conifer species.  The sugar pine has important environmental value as a key component of California forests, ecological and recreational value throughout the Sierra Nevada, and economic value as a source of timber,  Neale said. Around 1930, white pine blister rust was introduced into California. The fungal pathogen is a significant threat to sugar pines and other species of  white pines.  In fact, of the commercially important white pines in North America, sugar pine is most susceptible to white pine blister rust. In addition, sugar pine survival is threatened by damage from bark beetles, and the ongoing drought and lack of snowpack in the Sierra. Sequencing pine genomes Pine trees and other ancient conifers are dominant species in forests found in temperate regions of the world. The genus Pinus includes over 100 species of pine trees, which fall into two major subgroups -- the yellow pines and the white pines. The loblolly pine, a member of the yellow pine subgroup, was sequenced by Neale, Langley and colleagues last year. The newly sequenced sugar pine has a genome 1.5 times larger than the loblolly pine, which itself was considered large when it was sequenced. These two new reference sequences serve as foundations for future studies and applications in pine trees.  The sequencing and assembly of these two pine genomes reaches the present-day limits of genomic technologies and methods,  said Professor Langley.  Like the human genome reference sequence, they are not yet complete, but they do provide an almost complete  parts list  and a draft of the  instructions.  Building on earlier disease resistance discoveries Bohun Kinloch, an emeritus research geneticist with the U.S. Forest Service, used traditional breeding methods and progeny testing over many years, before sequencing existed, to detect a rare blister rust resistance gene in sugar pine  parent trees  in 1970.  The U.S. Forest Service plants seedlings from resistant parent trees into forests, so the new diagnostic tools derived from the reference sequences will speed the finding of disease-resistant parent trees directly, bypassing costly progeny testing. Seeds planted from these parents will help protect new generations of sugar pine trees from the devastating blister rust pathogen,  Kinloch said. This information is of great interest to environmental agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and timber companies such as Sierra Pacific Industries that manage the natural range of sugar pine. Accessing the genome sequence The sugar pine genomic information has been made freely available by the U.S. Department of Agriculture s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which funded the project; UC Davis; and the other research partners. A report of the sequencing and analyses of the sugar pine genome is pending publication in a scientific journal.

Although the cells that seed metastasis and the sites that they tend to travel to have been increasingly studied over the years, little has been known about how cancer migrates from a primary site, such as breast tissue, to a secondary site, such as the brain or bone marrow. A study by researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) offers a new view of how cancer cells extend their reach, co-opting and transforming normal cells through ""metastatic hijacking."" The researchers also find that in pre-clinical models, pharmacological intervention can prevent this hijacking from occurring, pointing to new therapeutic targets for preventing cancer cells from spreading. ""Metastasis remains a final frontier in the search for a cure for cancer,"" said Shiladitya Sengupta, MS, PhD, of BWH's Bioengineering Division in the Department of Medicine and corresponding author of the study. ""For the past five years we have studied how cancer travels to other parts of the body, and what we find is that communication is key.""""By working together, our labs have been able to gain greater insights into cell-cell communication in tumor states, which will shed new light on cancer as a disease and the promise and potential of emerging innovative therapies,"" said Elazer Edelman, MD, PhD, of BWH's Cardiovascular Division in the Department of Medicine. Sengupta, Edelman and colleagues began with a simple experiment. In the lab, they constructed a three-dimensional tumor matrix, complete with endothelial cells, and added metastatic breast cancer cells. They observed that instead of adhering to themselves to form a sphere, the metastatic breast cancer cells spread out along the model's blood vessels. Using a scanning electron microscope, the researchers detected long, thin tubes extending outward from the cells - nanoscale bridges that connected the cancer cells to normal tissue. The researchers found that the molecular profiles of some of the normal, endothelial cells had been changed, and hypothesized that microRNAs were being transferred over the bridges into the endothelial cells. Upon closer examination, they found that the transformed endothelial cells now harbored two microRNAs that have previously been implicated in metastasis. The researchers then used chemical compounds to prevent the nanoscale bridges from forming, disrupting communication between the tumor cells and endothelium. They did so in the laboratory constructed model and also in a mouse model, finding that pharmacological agents, including docetaxel, which is used to treat metastatic breast cancer, decreased the number of nanoscale bridges formed by the cells. In mice pre-treated with the pharmacological agents, the researchers observed a significant decrease in metastatic tumor burden. In future studies, the researchers will look to see if ATPase inhibitors - drugs that have been studied for treating HIV-AIDS - may also be effective at preventing the bridges from forming and inhibiting metastasis. ""Our study opens up new avenues for exploration and suggests that these nanoscale membrane bridges may represent new therapeutics in managing metastatic breast cancer,"" said Sengupta. ""We plan to continue searching for and evaluating treatments that take aim at these conduits.""","Published: December 17, 2015"

For many patients with this rare cancer, surgery is all that's needed. But in aggressive forms of penile cancer, few therapeutic options exist, particularly targeted therapies. The new study, led by researchers at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, describe a complex landscape that could suggest potential clinical trials of targeted therapies - and potential limitations in some patients. ""We saw that determining the best targeted therapies may be more complicated in penile cancer than in other cancers based on the combinations of genetic changes and variability between primary tumor and metastases,"" says senior study author Scott A. Tomlins, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of pathology and urology at the University of Michigan Medical School. Researchers performed next generation sequencing on 43 cases of penile squamous cell carcinoma. The cases varied in stage, grade and subtype. Fourteen samples were matched to include the primary tumor and metastatic tissue. The researchers found a common combination of alterations in the genes KRAS, HRAS and NRAS, as well as alterations in the gene EGFR. Although tumors such as colon cancer are commonly treated with EGFR inhibitors, tumors with KRAS or NRAS mutations are resistant to EGFR inhibitors. Importantly, clinical trials are planned using EGFR inhibitors in penile cancers based on anecdotal examples of clinical response. ""In colon cancer, there are so few HRAS mutations that they haven't been tested for predicting resistance to EGFR inhibitors. But based on the biology of HRAS, NRAS and KRAS, we would predict that they do cause resistance. As HRAS mutations are relatively common in penile cancer, this alteration may impact the tumor's response to an EGFR inhibitor in this cancer type,"" Tomlins says. In addition, the researchers found differences between the original primary tumor and metastases in the pelvic lymph nodes. In most cancers, the best therapeutic targets are the same in primary tumors and metastases, suggesting that genetic changes occur early in cancer's development. These findings indicate that aggressive forms of penile cancer mutate as they begin to spread and more than one area of tumor may need to be studied to identify the best therapeutic target for a given patient. ""It may not be as simple as matching one drug with one mutation based on a single sample in penile cancer. We may need to take the genomic profile in total from one or more areas to determine best strategies,"" Tomlins says. Sequencing was done using the Oncomine Comprehensive Panel, a new assay that assesses the most common genetic variants across cancer types. The assay is filtered to include variants associated with potential therapies that are approved or being studied in clinical trials. The assay is being used in the National Cancer Institute MATCH trial. It was developed and validated by researchers at the University of Michigan and Thermo Fisher Scientific. Penile cancer represents about 17 percent of all cancers in men. While a rare disease, the study also revealed key similarities with other squamous cell cancers, such as lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and cervical cancer. ""This provides a roadmap to design better, more informed trials for penile cancer. We have some good leads for potential therapeutic approaches. This is the basic knowledge we need to open the door to more individualized trials and treatments in the future,"" Tomlins says.","Published: December 17, 2015"

Developed after hearing from hundreds of stakeholders and scientific advisers, and in collaboration with leadership and staff of NIH s Institutes, Centers, and Offices (ICOs), the plan is designed to complement the ICOs  individual strategic plans that are aligned with their congressionally mandated missions.  Scientific and technological breakthroughs that have arisen from NIH-supported research account for many of the gains that the United States has seen in health and longevity,  said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.  But much remains to be done. This strategic plan will guide our efforts to turn scientific discoveries into better health, while upholding our responsibility to be wise stewards of the resources provided by the American people.  The plan focuses on four essential, interdependent objectives that will help guide NIH s priorities over the next five years as it pursues its mission of seeking fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and applying that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The objectives are to: 1. advance opportunities in biomedical research in fundamental science, treatment and cures, and health promotion and disease prevention; 2. foster innovation by setting NIH priorities to enhance nimbleness, consider burden of disease and value of permanently eradicating a disease, and advance research opportunities presented by rare diseases; 3. enhance scientific stewardship by recruiting and retaining an outstanding biomedical research workforce, enhancing workforce diversity and impact through partnerships, ensuring rigor and reproducibility, optimizing approaches to inform funding decisions, encouraging innovation, and engaging in proactive risk management practices; and 4. excel as a federal science agency by managing for results by developing the  science of science,  balancing outputs with outcomes, conducting workforce analyses, continually reviewing peer review, evaluating steps to enhance rigor and reproducibility, reducing administrative burden, and tracking effectiveness of risk management in decision making.  We are faced with extraordinary opportunities that demand exceptional attention if their promise is to be fully realized. Implementing these objectives will enable the more than 300,000 researchers supported by NIH across the nation and around the world to drive science further and deliver cures faster,  said NIH Principal Deputy Director Lawrence A. Tabak, D.D.S., Ph.D. To inform development of the strategic plan, Dr. Tabak said NIH solicited input from a wide range of stakeholders through a Request for Information, which generated more than 450 responses; a series of interactive webinars, which attracted more than 750 participants; and meetings with 21 NIH advisory councils, including the Advisory Committee to the NIH Director. The plan concludes with a bold vision for NIH, listing some specific achievements and advances that the agency will strive to deliver over the next five years. These aspirations include:   Many thousands of cancer patients will experience enhanced survival from application of precision medicine.   A candidate vaccine that induces a broad antibody-binding response to multiple strains of the influenza virus will be in clinical trials   a critical step toward a universal flu vaccine.   NIH-supported research will develop effective, tailored behavioral and social interventions to promote health and prevent illness in populations that experience health disparities.   Application of pharmacogenomics in real-world clinical settings will lead to improved outcomes in the use of several drugs.   A pivotal efficacy trial of a novel HIV vaccine, expected to begin in the Republic of South African in 2016, will confer at least 50% protection against the acquisition of HIV.   NIH-supported clinical trials will show that at least a half-dozen interventions thought to be clinically beneficial actually have no value.   Radical new methods for structural biology will revolutionize drug screening and optimization.   NIH-supported research will directly contribute to FDA-approved therapies for at least a dozen rare diseases.   Application of certain mobile health (mHealth) technologies will provide rigorous evidence for their use in enhancing health promotion and disease prevention.   A wearable biosensor for monitoring blood-alcohol levels in real time will be developed and show efficacy for preventing alcohol-related injury and disease.   Technologies to reverse paralysis and restore some normal functions will be available to spinal cord injury patients.   Vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus will be field tested for efficacy, promising a solution for this leading cause of childhood pneumonias.   Research on the artificial pancreas will lead to advanced trials showing significantly better management of diabetes, without dangers of hypoglycemia.   NIH will be known as the model agency for applying the scientific method to itself   for learning and implementing in a rigorous way, how best to support biomedical research. Over the next five years, NIH leadership will evaluate the agency s progress in meeting the objectives laid out in the strategic plan, which will be a living document that will be open to refinements throughout its life-cycle.","Published: December 17, 2015"

In a paper published recently the team show an entirely new way that pathogenic bacteria can initiate infection by using their surface sugars (or glycans) to attach the bacteria directly to sugars on the surface of human cells. Previous to this paper, this interaction was either not thought possible or was considered a weak, non-important interaction. The research was conducted by Associate Professor Renato Morona and Dr Elizabeth Tran from the University s Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology in collaboration with Dr Chris Day, Professor Victoria Korolik and Professor Michael Jennings from Griffith University.  As a result of the discovery we now have a better understanding of how bacteria initiate infections and how many current vaccines work,  says Associate Professor Renato Morona.   The discovery is fundamental knowledge that is broadly applicable to many other bacteria and microbes, and could have other translational outcomes such as new probes for studying human cells, and development of better infant milk formula.  Associate Professor Morona s laboratory showed that Shigella flexneri bacteria, which cause millions of episodes of dysentery in humans each year, use the sugars of their surface lipopolysaccharide molecules to stick to human gut cells. No Shigella vaccines are currently available despite decades of research worldwide, and the bacteria can be resistant to many antibiotics. He believes this latest research will advance progress towards new vaccines and other ways to block the sugars.","Published: December 17, 2015"

OmnomicsQ software was developed to provide an objective, third party evaluation based on validated NGS quality metrics, and in accordance with the College of American Pathologists  NGS practice guidelines. EMQN and UK NEQAS for Molecular Genetics have pioneered the development of EQA for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Their scheme aims to (a) assess and improve quality; (b) to enable laboratories to benchmark their NGS service against peer organisations and against best practices; (c) to work towards consistency of reporting clinical results generated by NGS; and (d) to contribute towards best practices. This year s EQA was provided as a wet laboratory-based exercise which asked participants to test a genomic DNA sample using their standard NGS process and report the results back to the EQA providers. This NGS EQA scheme will play an important role in enabling labs to benchmark this new technology, assess the accuracy of data and facilitate high quality reporting for patient benefit. Euformatics provides support for the data gathering, data validation, result analysis and for visualisation of QC metrics based on omnomicsQ, a new NGS data quality management tool. The omnomicsQ tool provides easy, automatic, and continuous internal quality control (IQC). It is sequencer, chemistry, and bioinformatics pipeline agnostic, and is therefore suitable for all sequencing platforms. Regular use allows users to follow data quality over time, by capture kit, by protocol or by instrument. It provides computer-readable information for workflow integration and human-readable reports and graphics for preventive and corrective actions to support method validation, saving time and reducing costs while achieving excellence in the practice of NGS-based laboratory medicine. NGS is the fastest growing technology expanding from research laboratories into clinical genetics laboratories worldwide, allowing new NGS-based genetic tests to get to market almost every week. Both large amounts of measurement data, and the stochastic nature of this data creates challenges, not only for the laboratories themselves, but also for regulatory organisations and the medical community at large. In order to accelerate NGS technology towards standardised clinical practices, proficiency tests and EQA are needed. EQA schemes contribute to the improvement of the overall quality of laboratory testing.  NGS quality control is vital for ensuring successful and accurate NGS test results. This partnership helps to advance our development of best practices and the further diffusion of technological innovation in molecular genetics testing. We will also be able to deliver more comprehensive EQA reports to all participants.  said Director Sandi Deans from UK NEQAS for Molecular Genetics and Director Simon Patton from EMQN.  We are proud to contribute to this effort by EMQN and UK NEQAS for Molecular Genetics, and to help smooth both the result submission and data analysis process , said Jussi Volanen, CEO of Euformatics.","Published: December 17, 2015"

Adult cells, such as skin or blood cells, have a cellular  memory,  or record of how the cell changes as it develops from an uncommitted embryonic cell into a specialized adult cell. Now, Harvard Stem Cell Institute researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in collaboration with scientists from the Research Institutes of Molecular Biotechnology (IMBA) and Molecular Pathology (IMP) in Vienna have identified genes that when suppressed effectively erase a cell s memory, making the cell more susceptible to reprogramming and, consequently, making the process of reprogramming quicker and more efficient.  We began this work because we wanted to know why a skin cell is a skin cell, and why does it not change its identity the next day, or the next month, or a year later?   said co-senior author Konrad Hochedlinger, PhD, an HSCI Principal Faculty member at MGH and Harvard s Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, and a world expert in cellular reprogramming. Every cell in the human body has the same genome, or DNA blueprint, explained Hochedlinger, and it is how those genes are turned on and off during development that determines what kind of adult cell each will become. By manipulating those genes and introducing new factors, scientists can unlock dormant parts of an adult cell s genome and reprogram it into another cell type. However,  a skin cell knows it is a skin cell,  said IMBA s Josef Penninger, even after scientists reprogram those skin cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells)   a process that would ideally require a cell to  forget  its identity before assuming a new one. Cellular memory is often conserved, acting as a roadblock to reprogramming.  We wanted to find out which factors stabilize this memory and what mechanism prevents iPS cells from forming,  Penninger said.  To identify potential factors, the team established a genetic library targeting known chromatin regulators   genes that control the packaging and bookmarking of DNA, and are involved in creating cellular memory. Hochedlinger and Sihem Cheloufi, co-first author and a postdoc in Hochedlinger s lab, designed a screening approach that tested each of these factors. Of the 615 factors screened, the researchers identified four chromatin regulators, three of which had not yet been described, as potential roadblocks to reprogramming. In comparison to the three to four fold increase seen by suppressing previously known roadblock factors, inhibiting the newly described CAF1 (chromatin assembly factor 1) made the process 50 to 200 fold more efficient. Moreover, in the absence of CAF1 reprogramming turned out to be much faster: While the process normally takes nine days, the researchers could detect the first iPS cell after four days.  The CAF1 complex ensures that during DNA replication and cell division daughter cells keep their memory, which is encoded on the histones that the DNA is wrapped around,  said Ulrich Elling, a co-first author from IMBA.  When we block CAF-1, daughter cells fail to wrap their DNA the same way, lose this information and covert into blank sheets of paper. In this state, they respond more sensitively to signals from the outside, meaning we can manipulate them much more easily.  By suppressing CAF-1 the researchers were also able to facilitate the conversion of one type of adult cell directly into another, skipping the intermediary step of forming iPS cells, via a process called direct reprogramming, or transdifferentiation. Thus, CAF-1 appears to act as a general guardian of cell identity whose depletion facilitates both the interconversion of one adult cell type to another as well as the conversion of specialized cells into iPS cells. In finding CAF-1, the researchers identified a complex that allows cell memory to be erased and rewritten.  The cells forget who they are, making it easier to trick them into becoming another type of cell,  said Sihem Cheloufi.  CAF-1 may provide a general key to facilitate the  reprogramming  of cells to model disease and test therapeutic agents, IMP s Johannes Zuber explained.  The best-case scenario,  Zuber said,  is that with this insight, we hold a universal key in our hands that will allow us to model cells at will. ","Published: December 17, 2015"

A University of Iowa study in mice shows that drug-induced changes to the gut microbiome can cause obesity by reducing the resting metabolic rate the rate at which calories are burned while sleeping or resting. The findings highlight the critical role of gut microbes in energy balance and suggest that unhealthy microbiome shifts can lead to weight gain and obesity by altering resting metabolism. ""Our research leads to the conclusion that it is probably bacteria (in the gut) that are responsible for the calories you burn while you are asleep,"" says John Kirby, Ph.D., professor of microbiology and urology at the UI Carver College of Medicine. Kirby and his colleagues focused on the effects of risperidone, an antipsychotic drug that causes significant weight gain in patients. Risperidone is used to treat various psychiatric disorders in adults and children, including autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, and prescribing rates for children have increased nearly eight-fold over the last two decades. In an earlier study, Kirby and Chadi Calarge, a UI pediatric psychiatrist, compared patients taking risperidone long-term to patients who were not on the drug. They found that weight gain was correlated with a significant shift in the composition of the patients' gut microbiomes. These results were published in Translational Psychiatry. In the new eBiomedicine study, Kirby teamed up with Justin Grobe, UI assistant professor of pharmacology, to find out how this risperidone-induced microbiome shift causes weight gain. Mirroring the human studies, the researchers showed that risperidone causes weight gain in mice (an extra 2.5 grams, or approximately 10 percent of the total body mass, over two months, compared to controls) and significantly alters the bacterial composition of the mouse microbiome. They then showed that the altered microbiome causes a reduction in resting metabolic rate that is entirely responsible for the excess weight gain. ""The control mice gain a little weight as they age and their microbiome undergoes a 'healthy shift' due to aging. With the risperidone, the mice become obese and exhibit an alternative, less healthy shift in their microbiome,"" Kirby says. ""With this study, we now have a mechanism for how a shift in the microbiome contributes to weight gain, and it's to do with changes to the resting metabolic rate."" The team was able to investigate how the microbiome shift affected the animals' metabolism by using a novel piece of equipment a total calorimetry machine invented by Grobe. The apparatus allows precise measurements of energy intake, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output, and heat production in a single animal to determine the total energy change, or ""delta G,"" of the mouse. The researchers discovered there was no change in aerobic (oxygen-dependent) resting metabolic rate for mice fed risperidone compared to control mice, but there was a significant decrease in non-aerobic resting metabolic rate sufficient to account for the animals' weight gain ""It's about a 16 percent change in resting metabolic rate, which is enormous,"" Grobe says. ""It would be 29 pounds of fat gained every year for an average human."" ""That is the equivalent of eating one additional cheeseburger every single day,"" adds Kirby. To prove that it was the ""shifted"" microbiome that was responsible for this metabolic change and the weight gain, the researchers transferred the microbiome from risperidone-fed mice into control mice and saw the same effect: decreased resting metabolic rate and increased weight gain. Moreover, they found it wasn't just the bacteria that could produce this effect. Transferring just a bacteriophage (phage) a type of virus that infect microbiome bacteria was sufficient to reduce resting metabolic rate and cause weight gain in the control mice. The results may suggest that manipulating resting metabolic rate, specifically by targeting the gut microbiome, could represent a new approach to treating obesity. Alternatively, preventing unhealthy changes to the microbiome may prove beneficial for patients undergoing risperidone treatment.","Published: December 17, 2015"

The new center will foster research collaborations across the School of Medicine and Danforth campuses, providing more resources for investigators in diverse disciplines. The new center is helmed by co-directors Lilianna Solnica-Krezel, PhD, the Alan A. and Edith L. Wolff Distinguished Professor and head of the Department of Developmental Biology; Shelly Sakiyama-Elbert, PhD, professor of biomedical engineering; and executive director Angela N. Bowman, PhD, assistant professor of developmental biology.  We want to facilitate research in the area of regenerative medicine, eventually leading to new methods to promote tissue regeneration in ways that improve healing,  Solnica-Krezel said.  We have about 70 faculty involved in the center from across the entire School of Medicine, plus the Departments of Biology and of Biomedical and of Mechanical Engineering on the Danforth Campus.  Along with other School of Medicine centers and divisions, the center is headquartered in the recently opened 4515 McKinley Research Building. The center encourages collaborations in areas including tissue regeneration, stem cell research, cellular reprogramming, cell and tissue engineering, and across the spectrum of development from understanding the earliest stages of the embryo to the latest stages of the aging process. According to the center s leadership, the areas of medicine and health with the potential to benefit from regenerative medical research are vast and diverse, from understanding the origin of birth defects to outlining the processes that govern degenerative diseases of aging, including heart disease and cancer.  Regenerative medicine is not just about stem cells,  Solnica-Krezel said.  We have faculty who are interested in the field of cellular reprogramming, where a skin cell can be reprogrammed into a brain cell, for example, without going through a stem cell phase.   New methods to study regeneration are continually expanding and growing,  she added.  The goal of our center is to support our investigators who are exploring these methods to promote healing, and tissue repair and replacement, and to bring people studying these methodologies to Washington University.  Bowman, whose research has focused on visual disorders and the regenerative properties of structures of the eye, noted that regenerative medicine is a popular topic of research. But despite the field s progress, there remain numerous problems to be solved, from progressive blindness, to age-related hearing loss, to diabetes, to paralysis from spinal cord injuries. Indeed, one example of the type of collaboration the center aims to foster is that between Sakiyama-Elbert s lab in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and noted peripheral nerve surgeon Susan E. Mackinnon, MD, the Sydney M. Jr. and Robert H. Shoenberg Professor and chief of the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. MacKinnon has pioneered techniques for rewiring and transplanting peripheral nerves, those that govern function and feeling in the limbs. Sakiyama-Elbert s lab has studied nerve regeneration in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Together, they are investigating whether biomedical scaffolds, combined with cellular proteins called growth factors, can help guide damaged peripheral nerves as they regenerate. Such techniques might improve and speed the peripheral nerve healing process, and perhaps inform efforts to promote healing of nerves in the spinal cord, which do not regenerate on their own.  We hope the center will help researchers in different fields come together and talk about innovative projects that wouldn t happen otherwise,  Sakiyama-Elbert said.","Published: December 17, 2015"

The new study from Kaiser Permanente also found the best protection against shingles was achieved when patients received the vaccination shortly after beginning dialysis. Shingles (also known as herpes zoster) is a painful skin rash that affects one in three adults and is caused by the varicella zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. The shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 60 and older. With ESRD, the kidneys stop working, requiring patients to undergo either dialysis or an organ transplant. Patients with ESRD are at greater risk than the general population for a variety of infections, including a 72 percent increased risk of developing shingles.  Previously the shingles vaccine was not widely given to patients on dialysis due to concerns of possible side effects and questions regarding its efficacy. Our study offers new real-world data to support the Centers for Disease Control s recommendation that elderly patients with chronic renal failure receive the shingles vaccine, if medically eligible,  said Hung Fu Tseng, PhD, MPH, study lead author, Kaiser Permanente Southern California Department of Research & Evaluation. This study is part of Kaiser Permanente s ongoing efforts to better understand the safety and effectiveness of shingles vaccines. In a study published earlier this year, Kaiser Permanente researchers found that people who received a vaccination for shingles but still contracted shingles had a lower risk of developing post-herpetic neuralgia (or PHN), a potentially long lasting and painful complication of the condition. In addition, in research published last year, Kaiser Permanente researchers found the shingles vaccine continues to be effective in protecting older adults against shingles, even after they undergo chemotherapy. The ESRD study population consisted of patients 60 years and older on chronic dialysis who were members of Kaiser Permanente in Southern California. Researchers followed 582 patients who received the shingles vaccine from January 2007 through December 2013 and compared them with 2,910 ESRD patients during the same period who never received the vaccine. Researchers found:   The shingles vaccine was associated with a 50 percent lower incidence rate of shingles among ESRD patients   The three-year risk of shingles was 4.1 percent for those who were vaccinated and 6.6 percent for those who were not   If the vaccine was given within two years of beginning dialysis, the shingles incidence rate was less than one-third of the rate in unvaccinated individuals","Published: December 17, 2015"

A study now explains why the flu vaccine is less effective at protecting older individuals. More broadly, the findings reveal novel molecular signatures that could be used to predict which individuals are most likely to respond positively to vaccination. ""We provide novel evidence of a potential connection between the baseline state of the immune system in the elderly and reduced responsiveness to vaccination,"" say co-senior study authors Shankar Subramaniam of the University of California, San Diego, and Bali Pulendran of Emory University. ""By providing a more complete picture of how the immune system responds to vaccination, our findings may help guide the development of next-generation vaccines that offer long-lasting immunity and better protection of at-risk populations."" Flu vaccines, which contain proteins found in circulating viral strains, offer protection by eliciting the production of antibodies -- proteins that help the immune system identify pathogens and protect against infectious disease. While vaccination is considered the most effective method for preventing influenza, it is less effective in the elderly. But until now, the molecular mechanisms underlying this decrease in vaccine efficacy were unknown. To address this question, Subramaniam and Pulendran identified molecular signatures of immunity to flu vaccination using systems biology approaches, which involve the computational and mathematical modeling of complex biological systems. They vaccinated 212 subjects, including 54 elderly individuals, across five influenza vaccine seasons, from 2007 to 2011, and analyzed blood samples to identify molecular pathways associated with protective antibody responses elicited by vaccination. They also analyzed previously published data for 218 additional subjects. Using this approach, the researchers identified molecular signatures present in blood samples collected a few days after vaccination that predicted with 80% accuracy whether the vaccine would elicit immune protection approximately four weeks later. Within one week of flu vaccination, young individuals showed high levels of antibody-producing B cells, whereas the elderly showed high levels of immune cells called monocytes, which elicit inflammatory responses in the body. These age-related differences predicted impaired vaccine-induced immune responses observed in the elderly three weeks later. ""Together, these results suggest potential mechanisms by which changes to the innate response in the elderly may result in diminished antibody responses to vaccination,"" Subramaniam says. Even before vaccination, high baseline levels of B cells, in conjunction with low levels of monocytes and related inflammatory molecules, predicted vaccine-induced immune protection four weeks later. ""This supports the concept that inflammatory responses at baseline may be detrimental to the induction of vaccine-induced antibody responses,"" Subramaniam says. ""While it is early to suggest, supplementary therapeutic approaches, such as reducing the inflammatory response in elderly patients after vaccination, would be valuable avenues to pursue. However, this warrants longer and more detailed investigations."" For their own part, the researchers plan on applying similar system biology approaches to study other viral infections, such as shingles and yellow fever. ""Analyzing these myriad 'omics' data in conjunction with physiological measurements is novel and will serve as a paradigm for future studies on influenza and other infections."" In the meantime, they urge caution against over-generalizing their new findings. ""This is obviously a complex problem, and the study reveals responses that are averaged across populations,"" Subramaniam says. ""As is true in every medical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, there is a distribution of responses with a majority conforming to the mean predicted response. So the important thing for the general audience to recognize is that there will be exceptions and variations.""","Published: December 17, 2015"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-cancer-cells-spread-197193,How Cancer Cells Spread Study offers new targets for drugs that may prevent cancer from spreading  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Scientists at MIT and Massachusetts General Hospital have discovered how cancer cells latch onto blood vessels and invade tissues to form new tumors   a finding that could help them develop drugs that inhibit this process and prevent cancers from metastasizing. Cancer cells circulating in the bloodstream can stick to blood vessel walls and construct tiny  bridges  through which they inject genetic material that transforms the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels, making them much more hospitable to additional cancer cells, according to the new study. The researchers also found that they could greatly reduce metastasis in mice by inhibiting the formation of these nanobridges.  Endothelial cells line every blood vessel and are the first cells in contact with any blood-borne element. They serve as the gateway into and out of tumors and have been the focus of intense research in vascular and cancer biology. These findings bring these two fields together to add greater insight into control of cancer and metastases,  says Elazer Edelman, the Thomas D. and Virginia W. Cabot Professor of Health Sciences and Technology, a member of MIT s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and one of the leaders of the research team. The lead author of the paper is Yamicia Connor, a graduate student in the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST). The paper s senior author is Shiladitya Sengupta, an assistant professor at HST and at Harvard Medical School. Building bridges Metastasis is a multistep process that allows cancer to spread from its original site and form new tumors elsewhere in the body. Certain cancers tend to metastasize to specific locations; for example, lung tumors tend to spread to the brain, and breast tumors to the liver and bone. To metastasize, tumor cells must first become mobile so they can detach from the initial tumor. Then they break into nearby blood vessels so they can flow through the body, where they become circulating tumor cells (CTCs). These CTCs must then find a spot where they can latch onto the blood vessel walls and penetrate into adjacent tissue to form a new tumor. Blood vessels are lined with endothelial cells, which are typically resistant to intruders.  Normal endothelial cells should not enable a cancer cell to invade, but if a cancer cell can connect with an endothelial cell, and inject signals that enable this endothelial cell to be controlled and completely transformed, then it facilitates metastasis,  Sengupta says. The researchers first spotted tiny bridges between cancer cells and endothelial cells while using electron microscopy to study the interactions between those cell types. They speculated that the cancer cells might be sending some kind of signal to the endothelial cells.  Once we saw that these structures allowed for a ubiquitous transfer of a lot of different materials, microRNAs were an obvious interesting molecule because they re able to very broadly control the genome of a cell in ways that we don t really understand,  Connor says.  That became our focus.  MicroRNA, discovered in the early 1990s, helps a cell to fine-tune its gene expression. These strands of RNA, about 22 base pairs long, can interfere with messenger RNA, preventing it from being translated into proteins. In this case, the researchers found, the injected microRNA makes the endothelial cells  sticky.  That is, the cells begin to express proteins on their surfaces that attract other cells to adhere to them. This allows additional CTCs to bind to the same site and penetrate through the vessels into the adjacent tissue, forming a new tumor.  It s almost like the cancer cells are cooperating with each other to facilitate migration,  Sengupta says.  You just need maybe 1 percent of the endothelial cells to become sticky, and that s good enough to facilitate metastasis.  Non-metastatic cancer cells did not produce these invasive nanobridges when grown on endothelial cells. Erkki Ruoslahti, a professor of cell, molecular, and developmental biology at the University of California at Santa Barbara, says that the discovery is an important advance in understanding tumor metastasis.  I found it particularly interesting that the transfer of regulatory macromolecules from tumor cells to endothelial cells via intercellular nanotubes appears to be more effective (at least over relatively short distances) than exosome-mediated transfer, which has received a lot of attention lately,  says Ruoslahti, who was not part of the research team. Shutting down metastasis The nanobridges are made from the proteins actin and tubulin, which also form the cytoskeleton that gives cells their structure. The researchers found that they could inhibit the formation of these nanobridges, which are about 300 microns long, by giving low doses of drugs that interfere with actin. When the researchers gave these drugs to mice with tumors that normally metastasize, the tumors did not spread. Sengupta s lab is now trying to figure out the mechanism of nanobridge formation in more detail, with an eye toward developing drugs that act more specifically to inhibit the process.  If we can first understand how these structures are formed, then we can try to design targeted therapies to inhibit their formation, which could be a promising new area for developing drugs that specifically target metastasis,  Connor says.","Published: December 17, 2015"

The team also identified a second pattern of gene expression that is more specific: It can distinguish the flu from other respiratory infections. When pathogens infect the cells of the body, the infection sets off a chain reaction involving the immune system that changes the expression of hundreds of genes. Gene expression is the process by which cells extract information from the genes and render it as molecules of protein or RNA. Cells have the capacity to express more or less of each molecule, creating a pattern of expression that changes in response to external influences   including infection by viruses. Purvesh Khatri, PhD, assistant professor of medicine, and a team of six other researchers at Stanford identified 396 human genes whose expression changes in a consistent pattern that reveals the presence of a viral infection. The pattern of changes, which they call the meta-virus signature, occurs in a range of viruses and is distinct from the pattern of gene expression in healthy people or in people with bacterial infections. The meta-virus signature pattern of gene expression is also present even before a person has clear symptoms of infection. In their paper the authors also described a second gene expression pattern that signals when a person is infected specifically with the flu virus. This second pattern, the influenza meta-signature, consists of a change in the expression of just 11 human genes. The influenza meta-signature pattern can distinguish flu from other viral infections, as well as from bacterial infections. It can also identify a flu infection before a person has symptoms and even reveal whether a person is building immunity after getting the flu vaccine. Khatri, a bioinformatician, is the senior author of the paper. Lead authorship is shared by doctoral student Marta Andres-Terre and former postdoctoral scholar Helen McGuire, PhD. Khatri said his team was motivated by the long-term goal of finding broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, much like the broad-spectrum antibiotics that have saved so many people from deadly bacterial infections. Broad-spectrum antivirals could be used against dengue fever and other killers, he said. Waving a red  infection  flag The researchers  first step was to look for a general change in gene expression in response to infection by viruses generally. They began by looking at changes in gene expression in a set of publicly available data. In blood samples from 205 people infected with a flu, cold or respiratory syncytial virus, the team found 396 genes whose expression changed in the same way during all three types of infections, with an increase in the expression of 161 genes and a decrease in the expression of 235 genes. The team then found the same pattern in a larger group of blood and tissue cell samples from 2,939 people consisting of healthy controls and those infected with a diverse array of pathogens, including viruses such as SARS coronavirus, enterovirus and adenovirus, as well as bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Salmonella. In the larger group, the team found the same altered pattern of expression in the same 396 genes among patients with viral infections. The meta-virus signature not only identified individuals with an active viral infection, but also those who were incubating one. By studying blood samples taken frequently   every eight hours for five days   the Stanford team discovered the meta-virus signature pattern waving a red  infection  flag up to 24 hours before the first symptoms.  An individual s gene expression signature changed before they became sick, so we could predict up to 24 hours before who was going to show symptoms,  said Khatri. The same high-frequency sampling data also revealed that the meta-virus signature signal, the one indicating any virus, began first. Then, a few hours later, the more-specific influenza meta-signature signal began in people with the flu.  It seems that when there is a viral infection, the immune system turns on a general response to all viruses, followed by a virus-specific response to the particular virus,  said Khatri.  You can imagine a decision tree where the immune system asks,  Is it bacterial or viral?  And if it s viral it turns on the meta-virus signature response. And then it asks,  If it s viral, which virus is it?  And then it turns on a specialized response for that virus.  Theoretically, the meta-virus signature could be used clinically to distinguish viral from bacterial infections to determine if an antibiotic should be prescribed. The Khatri lab has funding to develop such a test. The team s work is an example of Stanford Medicine s focus on precision health, the goal of which is to anticipate and prevent disease in the healthy and precisely diagnose and treat disease in the ill. Is the vaccine working? Another goal is to more precisely determine whether someone is responding to vaccination.  The goal of vaccination is to generate the same immune response without the symptoms,  he said.  If the IMS response is truly virus-specific, we should see the same response in vaccination.  And, in fact, the Khatri team found that in three independent studies of flu vaccine recipients, all those judged to have responded to vaccination by other measures also displayed the 11-gene influenza meta-signature. Likewise, nonrespondents showed no influenza meta-signature response. In short, if you see the gene expression signature, you know the person is responding to the vaccine. Until now, said Khatri, no one has found the immune response that turns on in both the vaccination response and in actual infections. This paper demonstrates for the first time a  transcriptional signature  that can be used as a proxy for whatever immune mechanism is induced by both vaccination and infection.  We have identified the common signature that links infection and vaccination,  he said. The work on the vaccination response also added to the understanding of men s immune response, which is different from women s. Other research has suggested that men s immune response to vaccines was somehow suppressed. In previous work, researchers looked at men s and women s responses on the third day after vaccination, when women had a strong reaction and men had none. But Khatri s group found that men were responding most on the first day after vaccination. In other words, men were responding to flu vaccine sooner than women. By the third day, men s immune response returned to baseline.  The dynamics are different,  he said,  and we haven t been sampling at the right time.  The Stanford paper also looked at samples from patients with acute pneumonia. In these patients, the influenza meta-signature distinguished viral pneumonia from bacterial pneumonia. As patients recovered, their influenza meta-signatures gradually returned to a healthy baseline level.  So you can also use IMS to monitor patients  progress,  said Khatri.","Published: December 17, 2015"

While abnormal immune responses are largely responsible for these diseases, issues relating to gut microbiome, intestinal epithelial cells, immune components, and the gut s rhythmic peristalsis motions can also contribute to and exacerbate symptoms. But until now, scientists have been hard pressed to develop new therapies for treating IBDs because they could not replicate the human gut microenvironment in the laboratory. On Monday, the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University announced that its team had created a model of human intestinal inflammation and bacterial overgrowth in a human-gut-on-a-chip. The team, co-led by Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber and core faculty member James Collins, leveraged the institute s proprietary human-organs-on-chips technology to microengineer the model. The advance allows scientists to analyze for the first time how normal gut microbes and pathogenic bacteria contribute to immune responses, and to investigate IBD mechanisms in a controlled model that recapitulates human intestinal physiology.  Chronic inflammation of the intestine is thought to be caused by abnormal interactions between gut microbes, intestinal epithelial cells, and the immune system, but so far it has been impossible to determine how each of these factors contributes to the development of intestinal bowel disease,  said Hyun Jung Kim, former Wyss Technology Development Fellow and first author of the study, speaking about the limitations of conventional in vitro and animal models of bacterial overgrowth and inflammation of the intestines. The human-gut-on-a-chip technology, however, provides an ideal microenvironment for mimicking the natural conditions of the human intestines in a small-scale, controllable, in vitro platform. The human-gut-on-a-chip was first invented at the Wyss Institute in 2012. Made of a clear, flexible polymer about the size of a computer memory stick, the hollow-channeled microfluidic device simulates the physical structure, microenvironment, peristalsis-like waves and fluid flow of the human intestine. In this latest advance, the Wyss team showed that the human-gut-on-a-chip s unique ability to co-culture intestinal cells with living microbes from the normal gut microbiome for an extended period of time   up to two weeks   could give breakthrough insights into how the microbial communities that flourish inside our GI tracts contribute to human health and disease.  The discovery of the microbiome and its significance represents a huge paradigm shift in our understanding of human health   there are more microbes living on us and in us than our own cells,  said Ingber, the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, and professor of bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.  Until now, use of traditional culture methods and even more sophisticated organoid cultures have prevented the microbiome from being studied beyond one or two days,  Ingber said.  With our human-gut-on-a-chip, we can not only culture the normal gut microbiome for extended times, but we can also analyze contributions of pathogens, immune cells, and vascular and lymphatic endothelium, as well as model specific diseases to understand complex pathophysiological responses of the intestinal tract.   There is much to be learned about IBD, as well as how antibiotics impact the microbiome,  said Collins, the Termeer Professor of Bioengineering in the Department of Biological Engineering and Institute for Medical Engineering & Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  This technology enables one to study in an isolated and controlled manner the complexity of the microbiome and the role different microbial species play in health and disease. It is therefore a highly valuable platform for discovery and clinical translation efforts.  Already the advance has revealed new discoveries into the inner workings of the human intestinal tract and its immune responses. Four small proteins that stimulate inflammation (called cytokines) were found to work in tandem to trigger inflammatory immune responses that damage and irritate the bowel. This discovery could open a new potential therapeutic pathway to treating IBD by  blocking  these cytokine proteins simultaneously. The Wyss team also studied the roles fluid flow and the wave-like peristaltic movement of the gut play in maintaining a dynamic equilibrium of the gut microbiome, finding that absence of peristaltic movement can lead to rampant overgrowth of bacteria completely independent of changes in fluid flow. This could help explain why some patients with IBD and other conditions develop bacterial overgrowth, such as those who develop ileus, a syndrome that can occur after intestinal surgery when there is a prolonged delay in the body s ability to resume normal peristaltic motions. The Wyss team believes the ability of the human-gut-on-a-chip to culture the microbiome with human gut cells also holds promise for the field of precision medicine, in which a patient s own cells and gut microbiota one day could be cultured inside a gut-on-a-chip for testing different therapies and identifying an individualized treatment strategy.  Previously the microbiome and its role in human health were largely defined through study of their gene expression, but now, by being able to carry out human experimentation in vitro relating to how the microbiome, human intestinal cells, and human immune components interplay, we hope to gain a much deeper understanding of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that will hopefully lead to development of new and more effective therapies,  said Ingber.","Published: December 17, 2015"

The trial is expected to commence shortly after receipt of regulatory approval, anticipated in the first quarter of 2016. The Phase 2 open-label study will be conducted as an investigator-initiated study in collaboration with Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology and Hematology, and will enroll up to 24 donor/recipient pairs. The study submission was made following a meeting with the FDA in October 2015 to discuss the BL-8040 stem cell mobilization development program. The trial will evaluate the ability of BL-8040 to promote stem cell mobilization as a single agent in the allogeneic transplantation setting. Donors between 18 and 70 years of age and their HLA-matching recipients, diagnosed with advanced hematological malignancies that require stem cell transplantation, will be recruited to the study. On the donor side, the primary endpoint of the study is the ability of a single injection of BL-8040 to mobilize sufficient amounts of cells for transplantation following up to two leukapheresis collections. On the recipient side the study aims to evaluate the functionality and engraftment following transplantation of the BL-8040 collected graft. The safety and tolerability of BL-8040 in the healthy donors will be evaluated. In addition, graft durability, the incidence of grade 2-4 acute graft versus host disease (GvHD), and other recipient related parameters will be evaluated in the patients who have undergone transplantation of hematopoietic cells mobilized with BL-8040. Dr. Kinneret Savitsky, Chief Executive Officer of BioLineRx, stated,  Stem cell mobilization is used increasingly as a method of collecting hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation, forming part of the treatment regimen for certain types of hematological cancers, as well as for severe anemia or immune deficiency disorders. We have already completed a successful Phase 1 safety and efficacy study in healthy volunteers, supporting BL-8040 as one-day, single-dose collection regimen, with the capacity to rapidly mobilize substantial amounts of stem cells, representing a significant improvement upon the current standard of care. Following a productive meeting with the FDA regarding the development program for BL-8040 as a stem cell mobilizer for allogeneic transplantation, and in light of the fact that there are no approved drugs for stem cell mobilization to support allogeneic transplant, we are looking forward to shortly commencing yet another Phase 2 trial for our lead oncology platform.   In parallel, BL-8040 is also undergoing a Phase 2 study for treating relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia patients, and has recently initiated a Phase 2b study as an AML consolidation treatment and a Phase 1/2 study as a novel treatment for hMDS and AA, two bone marrow failure conditions. In addition, as we recently announced, we are also performing an extensive evaluation of BL-8040 s potential in the immuno-oncology space, as a combination treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors,  added Dr. Savitsky.","Published: December 17, 2015"

A consensus panel of expert neuropathologists concluded that CTE has a pathognomonic signature in the brain, an advance that represents a milestone for CTE research and lays the foundation for future studies defining the clinical symptoms, genetic risk factors and therapeutic strategies for CTE. The neuropathological criteria defining CTE, or the NINDS CTE criteria, which appear in the journal Acta Neuropathologica, had been announced earlier this year at the Foundation of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) board meeting. CTE is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain found in persons with a history of repetitive brain trauma, including symptomatic concussions as well as asymptomatic sub-concussive hits to the head. The trauma triggers progressive degeneration of the brain tissue, including the build-up of an abnormal protein called tau. These changes in the brain can begin months, years or even decades after the last brain trauma or end of active athletic involvement. The brain degeneration is associated with memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, impulse control problems, aggression, depression, and, eventually, progressive dementia. A consensus panel of seven neuropathologists independently reviewed slides from 25 cases of different diseases associated with tau deposits in the brain, completely blinded to all clinical information, including age, sex, clinical symptoms and athletic exposure using provisional diagnostic criteria for CTE developed by Ann McKee, MD, Director of the CTE Program at Boston University and Chief of Neuropathology, VA Boston Healthcare System. The neuropathologists concluded that the criteria distinguished CTE from other tauopathies, including aging and Alzheimer's disease, and that CTE had a unique pathological signature in the brain. According to McKee, neuropathologists agreed on the diagnosis of CTE and confirmed the interim standards. ""The specific feature considered unique to CTE was the abnormal perivascular accumulation of tau in neurons, astrocytes and cell processes in an irregular pattern at the depths of the cortical sulci,"" explained McKee who is corresponding author of the study. ""This lesion was not characteristic of any of the other disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, age-related tauopathy or progressive supranuclear palsy, and has only been found in individuals who were exposed to brain trauma, typically multiple episodes,"" she added.

When we want to grab another person's attention, we look directly into their eyes. Why do we behave this way? What happens during our gazing? Researchers at the National Institute of Physiological Science (NIPS) have revealed that mutual eye contact synchronizes spontaneous activity in specific areas of the brains of two interacting parties. The finding indicates that this synchronized brain activity is crucial in establishing and facilitating face-to-face social interaction. In most cultures, we are taught from a young age to maintain eye contact when we speak. Failure to do so may be considered impolite, and can even risk losing the other party's attention. As it turns out, eye contact is fundamental in all human face-to-face interactions. The mechanisms of visual attention through eye contact maintained between two people (mutual gaze), and toward a third person or an object (joint attention), have been extensively studied. However, the underpinnings of the attention being shared and retained have remained unclear. To further explore this topic, the NIPS team enrolled 96 volunteers who were not mutually acquainted, and conducted a series of tests to investigate the brain activity during situations with sustained eye contact. Three sets of experiments were conducted over 2 days. Participants were paired with different partners and instructed to hold each other's gaze in real time under various conditions. The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imagining to monitor the brain activity that took place during mutual gaze. Takahiko Koike, the study's first author, explains: ""We expected that eye-blink synchronization would be a sign of shared attention when performing a task requiring joint attention, and the shared attention would be retained as a social memory."" They also expected that the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the brain would be activated by both the initiator and the respondent to the gaze. Indeed, the researchers detected synchronization of eye-blinks, together with enhanced inter-brain synchronization in the IFG, in the pairs when eye contact was established. Compared with findings from previous studies, these outcomes show that synchronization of eye-blinks is not attributable to a common activity, but rather to mutual gaze. This indicates that mutual eye contact might be a crucial component for human face-to-face social interactions, given its potential to bind two individuals into a singular connected system. This topic warrants further investigation to truly understand what is at work behind interpersonal communications. ""Based on the enhancement of behavioral and neural synchronization during mutual gaze, we now know that shared attention is hard to establish without eye contact,"" Norihiro Sadato, senior author of the study, says.

The study, performed in mice, found that immune cells reach the brain by traveling along odor-sensing neurons that emerge from the nasal cavity, not by breaching the blood-brain barrier directly. The findings could lead to improved methods for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating these disorders. The study, led by researchers at Columbia University Medical Center and the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, is published in the online edition of the Journal of Clinical Investigation. Recurrent Group A streptococcus (S. pyogenes) infections, which cause  strep throat,  have been linked to autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders, notably Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders associated with Streptococcal infections, or PANDAS. Children with PANDAS exhibit Tourette s syndrome like motor and vocal tics or obsessive-compulsive behaviors that appear to happen  out of the blue.  The Strep A bacterial cell wall contains molecules similar to those found in human heart, kidney, or brain tissue, according to a co-leader of the study, Dritan Agalliu, PhD, assistant professor of pathology and cell biology (in neurology and pharmacology) at Columbia University Medical Center. These  mimetic  molecules are recognized by the immune system, which responds by producing protective antibodies. But because of this molecular mimicry, the antibodies react not only to the bacteria but also to the host tissues, producing autoantibodies that attack the body s own tissues. Previously, scientists did not understand how these autoantibodies would gain access to the brain, because brain vessels form an extremely tight blood-brain barrier that prevents free movement of molecules, antibodies and immune cells from the blood into the brain. A few years ago, researchers discovered that recurrent Strep A infections trigger the production of immune cells known as Th17 cells, a type of helper T cell, in the nasal cavity. But it was unclear how these Th17 cells lead to brain inflammation and symptoms such as those seen in children with PANDAS. Studying the tissues of mice infected intranasally with Strep A, Agalliu and colleagues found that bacterial-specific Th17 cells move along the surface of olfactory, or odor-sensing, axons that extend from the nasal cavity through the cribriform plate, a sieve-like bone that separates the nasal cavity from the brain. From there, the cells reach the olfactory bulb in the brain, which processes information about odors.  Once the Th17 cells enter the brain, they break down the blood-brain barrier, allowing autoantibodies and other Th17 cells to enter the brain and promote neuroinflammation,  said Dr. Agalliu.  What s interesting is that we see abundant Group A Strep bacteria in the nose, but they never penetrate the brain,  he added.  This is different from Group B Strep the cause of bacterial meningitis which causes neuroinflammation by entering the brain directly.  The findings may lead to a more definitive diagnostic test for PANDAS, which is currently diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and the presence of Strep A infection or autoantibodies against brain proteins.  We are also interested in exploring ways to treat the disorder by repairing the blood-brain barrier itself to prevent the entry of autoantibodies into the brain,  said Agalliu.

Serotonin affects emotions, sleep, anxiety, depression, appetite, pulse and breathing. It also plays a role in serious psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. ""Serotonin essentially modulates every aspect of brain function, including movement,"" Zhang says. The transmitter is made by a small number of neurons localized on one structure at the back of the brain. Serotonin exerts its influence because the neurons that make it project to almost every part of the brain. The study, reported today in the journal Nature Biotechnology, began with two types of stem cells: one derived from embryos, the other from adult cells. Because serotonin neurons form before birth, the researchers had to recreate the chemical environment found in the developing brain in the uterus, Zhang says. ""That sounds reasonably simple, and we have made so many different types of neural cells. Here, we had to instruct the stem cells to develop into one specific fate, using a custom-designed sequence of molecules at exact concentrations. That's especially difficult if you consider that the conditions needed to make serotonin neurons are scarce, existing in one small location in the brain during development."" The cells showed the expected response to electrical stimulation and also produced serotonin. Although other scientists have matured stem cells into something resembling serotonin neurons, the case is much more conclusive this time, says first author Jianfeng Lu, a scientist at UW-Madison's Waisman Center. ""Previously, labs were producing a few percent of serotonin neurons from pluripotent stem cells, and that made it very difficult to study their cells. If you detect 10 neurons, and only two are serotonin neurons, it's impossible to detect serotonin release; that was the stone in the road."" Instead, those neurons were identified based on cellular markers, which is ""not sufficient to say those are functional serotonin neurons,"" Lu says. To confirm that the new cells act like serotonin neurons, ""we showed that the neurons responded to some FDA-approved drugs that regulate depression and anxiety through the serotonin pathway,"" Zhang says. While the previous attempts ""followed what was learned from mouse studies,"" the current study used other growth factors, Zhang says. ""It was not exactly trial and error; we have some rules to follow, but we had to refine it little by little to work out  one chemical at a time the concentration and timing, and then check and recheck the results. That's why it took time."" Although cells derived from stem cells are commonly used to test drug toxicity, Zhang is aiming higher with the serotonin neurons. ""We think these can help develop new, more effective drugs, especially related to the higher neural functions that are so difficult to model in mice and rats,"" he says. ""Particularly because they are from humans, these cells may lead to benefits for patients with depression, bipolar disorder or anxiety. These are some of the most troublesome psychiatric conditions, and we really don't have great drugs for them now."" Because the neurons can be generated from induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be produced from a patient's skin cells, ""these could be useful for finding treatments for psychiatric disorders like depression, where we often see quite variable responses to drugs,"" says Lu. ""By identifying individual differences, this could be a step toward personalized medicine. ""I'm like Su-Chun. I don't want to just make a publication in a scientific journal.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/treating-colon-cancer-with-vitamin-a-212341,Treating Colon Cancer with Vitamin A Scientists at EPFL identify the biological pathway behind the growth of colon cancer  and block it with vitamin A  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, colon cancer is famously resistant to treatment. There are many reasons for this, but one has to do with a group of persisting cancer cells in the colon that cause relapses. Conventional therapies against them are mostly ineffective. EPFL scientists have now identified a biological mechanism that can be exploited to counteract colon cancer relapses. The approach activates a protein that is lost in the persisting cancer cells. The researchers were able to reactivate it using vitamin A, thus eliminating the cancer cells and preventing metastasis.  When a colon-cancer patient receives treatment, e.g. chemotherapy, most of the cancer cells die off. But the genetic mutations that caused the cancer in the first place can survive in a specific group of cells of the colon. These are actually stem cells, meaning that they are premature cells waiting to grow into full-blown, normal cells of the colon. After cancer treatment ends, the surviving stem cells, still containing the cancerous mutations, can reappear and cause a relapse. The lab of Joerg Huelsken at EPFL studied how differentiated colon cells come from stem cells in the gut. Using an array of different techniques, the team looked at cells, mouse models and samples from human patients. Proteins and signaling pathways The study focused on a protein called HOXA5, which belongs to a family of proteins that regulate the development of the fetus. These proteins are made during early development and work together to make sure that every tissue is correctly identified and that the fetus s body and limbs are patterned properly. In the adult body, proteins like HOXA5 regulate the body s stem cells to maintain both the identity and function of different tissues. Huelsken s team found that in the gut, HOXA5 plays a major role in restricting the number of stem cells, as well as the cells that make them. Like all proteins, HOXA5 originates from a specific gene. The study showed that the cancerous stem cells of the colon use a biological mechanism that blocks it. This mechanism is called a  signaling pathway  because it involves a domino of molecules, each activating the next one down the line. The purpose of a signaling pathway is to transmit biological information from one part of the cell to another, e.g. from the outer membrane all the way to the nucleus. By blocking the HOXA5 gene, the cancerous stem cells of the colon can grow uncontrollably and spread, causing relapses and metastasis. Retinoids: a way to fight back The researchers looked for ways to reverse the blocking of HOXA5. The answer came from vitamin A. This small chemical structure is called a retinoid, and it has been known to induce differentiation of stem cells in the skin. The EPFL scientists found that retinoids can re-activate HOXA5. In mice that had colon cancer, the treatment with retinoids blocked tumor progression and normalized the tissue. By turning the gene for HOXA5 back on, this treatment eliminated cancer stem cells and prevented metastasis in the live animals. The researchers got similar results with samples from actual patients. The new study suggests that patients that may profit from this well-tolerated treatment can be identified based on their expression pattern for the HOXA5 gene. Retinoid differentiation therapy could be significantly effective against colon cancer, not only for treatment of existing disease but also as a preventive measure in high-risk patients.","Published: December 16, 2015"

The new project, which will launch on 1 February, 2016, will involve researchers from the University of Leeds, the University of Bristol and three drug discovery organisations: the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University; AstraZeneca; and Domainex. Professor Andrew Wilson, Deputy Director of The Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology at the University of Leeds, who will lead the project, said:  This is a huge untapped opportunity. There are thought to be as many as 600,000 protein-protein interactions that could be targets for new drugs. But we don t know which ones are most important, what is crucial for their interaction and how to target them. If we can develop our understanding of this  social life  of proteins, significant strides could be made in drug discovery.  Our project will create the tools to make this kind of drug discovery easier by analysing and categorising the important features of protein-protein interactions. This will provide the basis for discovering many new drugs for the treatment of disease.  To develop new drugs, scientists have become adept at blocking well-defined binding sites on proteins where small molecules can bind. This allows, for instance, many enzymes   a type of protein that accelerates a chemical reaction   involved in disease processes to be disabled. Dr Gail Bartlett, who will lead the computational biochemistry research at Bristol, explained the greater challenge of disrupting protein-protein interactions.  A protein-protein interaction is more like a handshake or an embrace. We don't know which chemical and structural features of the interface are most important, and additionally, the characteristics of small molecules that could block them are largely unknown. This project will elucidate rules for designing small molecules to target these interfaces.  Professor Adam Nelson, also from the University of Leeds, concluded:  Increasing innovation in drug discovery is a major challenge, in part because the easier,  low-hanging  drug targets have already been largely tapped. Our research will pave the way for a wide range of protein-protein interactions to be targeted by drugs in future. ","Published: December 16, 2015"

""This lncRNA can bind to other RNA, to a protein, or to a protein on one side and DNA on the other,"" says first author Suresh Mehta, a scientist in the Department of Neurological Surgery. ""Among many other jobs, lncRNAs can regulate gene activity."" ""Stroke influences the expression of all types of RNA, and this RNA has a broad influence throughout the cell after the blood supply is restored, in what we call reperfusion injury"" says Vemuganti. ""A few years ago, our lab started to look at how stroke affects noncoding RNA. Two years ago, we identified about 200 types of various lncRNAs that greatly increase or decrease after stroke, and zeroed in on one that we named FosDT. ""We knew that the level of FosDT went up more than tenfold in the rat brain within three hours after the stroke,"" adds Vemuganti. ""We thought, if we block FosDT after the stroke, would it make any difference in the amount of structural damage or behavioral disability?"" Vemuganti and his colleagues designed three custom-made strands of RNA to silence FosDT, injected them into the rats, and deliberately shut off one artery in the brain for one hour. Tests performed within the first week showed that the treated rats regained motor skills much faster and more completely than control animals. Brain scans showed a significant reduction in the total volume of brain that was destroyed by the stroke.  These studies were partially funded by the American Heart Association, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Neurological Surgery.  Further investigation showed that FosDT stimulates a pathway to cell death, while also impairing cell-survival pathways. Interfering with both mechanisms could explain the benefits, says Mehta. ""We did not change the initial insult, caused by lack of oxygen,"" says Vemuganti, ""but this targeted approach greatly reduced the damage after one week. We cannot completely reverse the post-stroke damage, but the total damage decreased by one-third. If we can protect this much brain tissue from stroke, that would be an enormous improvement."" Because post-stroke damage (the ""reperfusion injury"") can be even more disabling than harm caused by the initial loss of blood flow, Vemuganti says he is pursuing several lines of research. ""We are further exploring the mechanism, and we are preparing to see what happens after a stroke in rats that have no gene for FosDT."" Although rates of stroke have fallen in recent decades, about 795,000 Americans have a stroke each year, and stroke remains among the leading causes of disability. ""We intend to vigorously pursue this finding,"" Vemuganti said.","Published: December 16, 2015"

The team encapsulated the UV-blocking compounds in bio-adhesive nanoparticles, which adhere to the skin well, but do not penetrate beyond the skin s surface. These properties resulted in highly effective UV protection in a mouse model, without the adverse effects observed with commercial sunscreens, including penetration into the bloodstream and generation of reactive oxygen species, which can damage DNA and lead to cancer. Commercial sunscreens use compounds that effectively filter out damaging UV light. However, there is concern that these agents have a variety of harmful effects due to penetration past the surface skin. For example, these products have been found in human breast tissue and urine and are known to disrupt the normal function of some hormones. Also, the exposure of the UV filters to light can produce toxic reactive oxygen species that are destructive to cells and tissues and can cause tumors through DNA damage.   This work applies a novel bioengineering idea to a little known but significant health problem, adds Jessica Tucker, Ph.D., Director of the NIBIB Program in Delivery Systems and Devices for Drugs and Biologics.  While we are all familiar with the benefits of sunscreen, the potential toxicities from sunscreen due to penetration into the body and creation of DNA-damaging agents are not well known.Bioengineering sunscreen to inhibit penetration and keep any DNA-damaging compounds isolated in the nanoparticle and away from the skin is a great example of how a sophisticated technology can be used to solve a problem affecting the health of millions of people.  Bioengineers and dermatologists at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut combined their expertise in nanoparticle-based drug delivery and the molecular and cellular characteristics of the skin to address these potential health hazards of current commercial sunscreens. The results of their collaboration were reported in the September issue of Nature Materials.1 Minute vessels filled with sunscreen The group encapsulated a commonly used sunscreen, padimate O (PO), inside a nanoparticle (a very small molecule often used to transport drugs and other agents into the body). PO is related to the better-known sunscreen PABA. The bioadhesive nanoparticle containing the sunscreen PO was tested on pigs for penetration into the skin. A control group of pigs received the PO alone, not encapsulated in a nanoparticle. The PO penetrated beyond the surface layers of skin where it could potentially enter the bloodstream through blood vessels that are in the deeper skin layers. However, the PO inside the nanoparticle remained on the surface of the skin and did not penetrate into deeper layers.  Because the bioadhesive nanoparticles, or BNPs are larger than skin pores it was somewhat expected that they could not enter the body by that route. However, skin is full of hair follicles that are larger than BNPs and so could be a way for migration into the body. Surprisingly, BNPs did not pass through the hair follicle openings either. Tests indicated that the adhesive properties of the BNPs caused them to stick to the skin surface, unable to move through the hair follicles. Further testing showed that the BNPs were water resistant and remained on the skin for a day or more, yet were easily removed by towel wiping. They also disappeared in several days through natural exfoliation of the surface skin. BNPs enhance the effect of sunscreen An important test was whether the BNP-encapsulated sunscreen retained its UV filtering properties. The researchers used a mouse model to test whether PO blocked sunburn when encapsulated in the BNPs. The BNP formulation successfully provided the same amount of UV protection as the commercial products applied directly to the skin of the hairless mouse model. Surprisingly, this was achieved even though the BNPs carried only a fraction (5%) of the amount of commercial sunblock applied to the mice. Finally, the encapsulated sunscreen was tested for the formation of damaging oxygen-carrying molecules known as reactive oxygen species, (ROS) when exposed to UV light. The researchers hypothesized that any ROS created by the sunscreen s interaction with UV would stay contained inside the BNP, unable to damage surrounding tissue. Following exposure to UV light, no damaging ROS were detected outside of the nanoparticle, indicating that any harmful agents that were formed remained inside of the nanoparticle, unable to make contact with the skin.   We are extremely pleased with the properties and performance of our BNP formulation,  says senior author Mark Saltzman, Ph.D., Yale School of Engineering and Applied Science.  The sunscreen loaded BNPs combine the best properties of an effective sunscreen with a safety profile that alleviates the potential toxicities of the actual sunscreen product because it is encapsulated and literally never touches the skin.  Adds co-senior author, Michael Girardi, M.D.  Ournanoparticles performed as expected, however, these are preclinical findings. We are now in a position to assess the effects on human skin.

Such biopsies have been incorporated into studies sponsored by both the pharmaceutical industry and the National Cancer Institute. They are often mandatory in government-sponsored phase 1 clinical trials. The researchers identified 72 phase 1 studies of novel cancer drugs, published between 2003 and 2010, that involved such research biopsies. These studies included nearly 2,000 non-diagnostic biopsies of solid tumors. The tissue acquired from biopsies was used to study the biochemical and physiological effects of new drugs and the mechanism of their actions. Only 12 of those studies, however, reported a significant biomarker result. Only five follow-up publications cited these studies and mentioned the biomarkers. None of the data collected was ever used to guide subsequent decisions about optimal drug doses. These results ""call into question the increasing use of such biomarkers in phase 1 studies,"" said study author Mark Ratain, MD, professor of medicine at the University of Chicago. ""The process has had little or no impact on drug development or dose decisions."" The researchers focused on all studies published over the eight-year period that involved procurement of an invasive, non-diagnostic, post-treatment tumor biopsy. The 72 studies led to 1,873 biopsies. This figure, however, is likely low: 14 of the studies did not mention the number of biopsies performed. The researchers calculated the average cost of a biopsy for this purpose at about $6,675 per patient . Only 12 of the 72 studies (17 percent) reported a statistically significant biomarker result. Only five later publications, reporting results from phase 2 or phase 3 trials of the same drugs, mentioned the previous biomarker studies. No subsequent studies used the information from the biopsies to guide drug dose. They all recommended the maximum tolerated dose of those drugs, basing that decision on overall toxicity rather than the drugs' biologic activity as determined from biopsied tissue. Many studies include these biopsies as a mandatory part of the protocol, so ""patients have to consent to such studies if they want to receive the investigational drug, even though the biopsies in the studies we examined provided no research or clinical benefit,"" Ratain said. Mandatory biopsies would be reasonable if they were of scientific value. But ""our data shows that such studies have not had a scientific impact,"" Ratain said. ""Institutional review boards should consider whether such exploratory tissue sampling is even ethical."" Ratain said that biopsy studies that are the primary endpoint are ethical--if they are appropriately designed. ""Our findings argue that the use of invasive biopsies for the purpose of pharmacodynamics should be limited to clinical trials in which the primary objective is to ascertain the effect of the drug(s) on the biomarker,"" the authors conclude.

A question of enormous import in research, beyond the challenge of determining how malformed proteins contribute to specific disease processes, is figuring out ways to prevent or reduce the pathologies they cause. A natural process called nonsense-mediated decay, or NMD, provides cells with the ability to detect errors in the coded RNA messages, called transcripts, that are copied from DNA when genes are activated. The copying process is called transcription. Activation of a gene induces a cell to make an RNA copy of its code, edit unneeded segments out of that message, and splice together a final version of the message that provides cellular factories (ribosomes) with a template to make one specific protein. Mutations in genes can foul up the works, right from the start. Although mutations come in many varieties, one type, called nonsense mutations, involve the seemingly innocuous change of a single letter in the coded message--a change that causes the gene's message to prematurely read ""stop."" When things are working properly, the stop signal comes at the very end of the coded message. This tells the ribosome to end the protein manufacturing process at the appropriate place. When the stop signal comes too soon, due to a faulty letter in the code, the process ends prematurely and various outcomes are possible. Often, the error is noted by the cell and the NMD process is engaged, as a way of preventing bad outcomes. Via NMD, the faulty message is degraded and little or no protein is made. Other times, an abnormally short version of the protein is still manufactured. Such truncated proteins are sometimes harmless. Other times they are partially useful to the cell. Still other times a too-short protein can have toxic effects. A team led by CSHL Professor Adrian Krainer, an authority on the complex processes cells use to splice together the RNA messages (called mRNAs) that serve as protein templates, has now devised a method to prevent NMD from being engaged. The critical caveat is: his team has determined how to deactivate this cellular quality-control mechanism only when it is advantageous - only when it will result in the therapeutic restoration of protein manufacture, whether the resulting protein is full-length or at least partly functional. Part of the challenge is knowing in what situations it's going to be advantageous to inhibit NMD. The details are technical, involving how far - how many coded RNA letters - a premature stop signal occurs relative to a location on the message that serves as a loading site for an EJC (exon junction complex). EJCs are like chapter marks or tags deposited in the cell's nucleus as a gene's copied RNA message is edited, or spliced. The innovation tested successfully by Krainer and his team, including first author of the new paper, Tomoki Nomakuchi, along with Isabel Aznarez and Frank Rigo, involves the use of a molecule called an ASO (antisense oligonucleotide) that will block the site normally occupied by a particular EJC. ""We only want to dislodge or replace the EJC at one spot in the gene's spliced RNA message,"" explains Krainer. ""We design and test an ASO that will prevent a particular EJC from binding to the message; the others are unaffected."" Why? Because when the cell detects an EJC within a certain distance from a ""stop"" signal in a gene message, that is when it calls the NMD machinery into action, to halt decoding of the message and resulting in its degradation. The trick is do this only in gene messages in which a premature stop signal, if ignored, will nevertheless result in the production of a full-length, or at least partly functional protein - one that will have a helpful impact in a disease process. ""We are interfering with the NMD machinery's ability to target such mRNAs for destruction,"" Krainer says. ""This means the cell will make more protein. It may still be truncated - but that can be beneficial. In other cases, a truncated protein would not be functional, or could even be toxic."" In the latter cases, either it would not make sense to intervene with an ASO; or, an ASO could be combined, Krainer says, with so-called read-through drugs. These are drugs - still experimental - that prevent premature stop signals from halting protein production by ribosomes, although NMD tends to limit their efficacy. The current work shows that combining a read-through drug with an appropriate EJC-blocking ASO results in cells manufacturing substantially more full-length protein.","Published: December 16, 2015"
6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genetic-cause-of-heart-disease-195740,Genetic Cause of Heart Disease Penn study sheds light on a genetic cause of heart disease  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The presence or absence of the CAP2 gene causes sudden cardiac death in mice, according to new research from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. In particular, the absence of the gene interrupts the animal s ability to send electrical signals to the heart to tell it to contract, a condition called cardiac conduction disease.   This study proves that the CAP2 gene is directly responsible for cardiac conduction disease in mice,  said senior author Jeffrey Field, PhD, a professor of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics. Heart disease is the leading cause of death among men in the United States. There are several risk factors for heart disease, many of which can be controlled with changes in behaviors and medication, but there are also hard-wired genetic factors that play a role.  Since humans have the same CAP2 gene, what we learn from the mice could advance our understanding of heart disease.  Researchers have known that the CAP2 gene could be implicated in heart disease. However, its effect on cardiac conduction in the mouse heart was a surprise, Field said. The cardiac conduction system is a molecular network that sends electrical signals to the heart, telling it to contract in the correct rhythm to keep blood flowing smoothly. The CAP2 gene s class of protein, while known to regulate the structure or cytoskeleton of the heart, is not usually associated with cardiac conduction because this function is governed by a different family of proteins associated with cell communication.  Initially, saying that CAP2 is involved in cardiac conduction is like saying a person with a broken bone isn t able to talk,  Field said.  The bone s structural function and the ability to talk are each from entirely different systems. There s no relationship. This finding merits further study to see how exactly CAP2 regulates conduction. While we don t understand how, this gene definitely has a role in controlling conduction.  CAP2 Knockouts Using a mouse model in which the team deleted the CAP2 gene, they found that most newborn males died suddenly, soon after weaning. The males were also prone to eye infections, and their eyes developed incorrectly and could not efficiently flush away debris. The knockout mice were also smaller in overall body size. Though rare, some of the mice also developed hearts that were overly large.  The loss of the CAP2 gene resulted in bigger hearts because the heart had trouble contracting and to compensate, it dilated in order to get more blood flowing,  Field said. The knockout mice also exhibited arrhythmia that worsened over four to five days.  We were able to monitor the mice as they died. Their hearts beat slower and slower, and they quickly died of heart block,  he said. Heart block happens when the heart atriums contract, but the ventricles do not get the signal to contract. As a result, the mouse hearts missed a few beats at first, and then stopped completely. This condition is called sudden cardiac death, which is distinct from a heart attack caused by clogged arteries impeding blood supply to the heart. In this experiment, there were no observable effects of a missing CAP2gene on the female newborns. Parallels to Humans Studies of some children with a rare developmental problem, called 6p22 syndrome, hint that this gene is associated with similar cardiac issues in people. These children have deep-set eyes and cardiac problems that are not well defined.  Almost all of these children are born with a deletion of one of their copies of the CAP2 gene,  Field noted. Knowing this connection, the researchers generated mice that would exhibit only cardiac conduction disease (CCD). They reinstated the gene but this time engineered it so they could knock it out again, but this time only in the hearts of the mice.  It took close to five years to perfect this mouse model that exhibited only the heart knockout,  Field said. The researchers could then conduct experiments targeting only the heart problem, because all the other symptoms, such as the eye problems, were out of the picture. The mice once again developed CCD, leading to sudden cardiac death from complete heart block, but there was an extra surprise this time. The female newborns also died of CCD.  That s a puzzle for us. We d be interested in studying why the gender specificity for CAP2-related sudden cardiac death goes away when we knock the gene out just in the heart,  Field said. The team says that the study increases the understanding of how the CAP2 gene affects heart disease, but it also raises new questions that underline the need for further research heart disease and why it s a major cause of death in humans. ""It s an important problem in cardiology to understand why heart disease is more common in men versus women. This also happens with heart attacks and congenital heart disease,  said Field, who surmises that male-female hormonal differences may help explain the difference.","Published: December 16, 2015"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/uncovering-hardtodetect-cancer-mutations-212868,Uncovering Hard to Detect Cancer Mutations  Findings could help identify patients who would benefit from existing drugs  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. New research shows that current approaches to genome analysis systematically miss detecting a certain type of complex mutation in cancer patients  tumors. Further, a significant percentage of these complex mutations are found in well-known cancer genes that could be targeted by existing drugs, potentially expanding the number of cancer patients who may benefit.  The idea of not catching a targetable mutation in a patient s tumor is devastating,  said senior author Li Ding, PhD, associate professor of medicine and assistant director of the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University.  We developed a software tool for finding a certain type of genetic error that has been consistently missed by cancer genome studies. We identified a large number of such events in critical cancer genes. The ability to discover such events is crucial for cancer research and for clinical practice.  Mutations in the genome happen in a variety of ways. Perhaps the simplest is a change in a single  letter  of the DNA code. Among the more complex types of mutations are those that involve deleting or inserting a few letters. In the new study of 8,000 cancer cases, the investigators focused on mutations involving letters that are inserted at the same time that other letters are deleted.  We call this type of mutation a complex indel because insertion and deletion is happening at the same time, in the same genomic location,  said Ding, who also is a research member of the Siteman Cancer Center at the School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital.  It is very difficult to capture such events because conventional approaches were designed to catch one or the other, not both types at the same time and place.  To find the complex indels, the researchers developed specialized computer software and verified its accuracy in genome sequences into which they purposely introduced these complex mutations. Then, the researchers looked at cancer genomes that already had been sequenced and found 285 complex indels in genes known to be associated with cancer. About 81 percent of these complex indel events had been missed on the first analysis using conventional approaches. And another 18 percent had been misidentified as some other type of mutation. Ding emphasized the importance of developing special tools to find these complex indels, as the data suggest they go almost completely undetected by existing tools and appear to cluster in important cancer genes more often than can be attributed to random chance. This information is particularly valuable when indels are found in genes that already have drugs designed to counter the effects of mutation. In particular, the researchers identified complex indels in the gene EGFR, which is implicated in lung cancer. If such an indel is found in this gene, Ding and her colleagues suggest a patient may benefit from an EFGR inhibitor, such as erlotinib, regardless of the tumor type. The investigators also found complex indels in a gene called KIT, which appears to play a role in melanoma. The analysis suggests that patients with complex indels in KITwould benefit from drugs such as imatinib, sunitnib and sorafenib, which target mutations in this gene. The new software the investigators developed specifically to find complex indels is called Pindel-C. It was built on top of existing software called Pindel, which was published in 2009 by the study s first author, Kai Ye, PhD, assistant professor of genetics. Both versions of the software are freely available online for download.","Published: December 16, 2015"

The researchers hope to employ these cells -- in combination with algorithms akin to those used by face-recognition software -- to quickly organize the hundreds of thousands of molecules in institutional compound libraries according to their biological function, greatly facilitating the search for new and better drugs for cancer and other diseases. For this reason, they dubbed the cells ORACLs (Optimized Reporter cell lines for Annotating Compound Libraries). Co-senior authors Steven Altschuler, PhD, and Lani Wu, PhD, are professors of pharmaceutical chemistry in the UCSF School of Pharmacy and conducted the initial research in this area while at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The pair envision making drug discovery more like the field of genomics, where researchers have spent decades annotating large genomic databases as more and more functions are discovered for individual genes and regulatory elements. As a result of this community effort, researchers can now rapidly identify particular genes of interest for more targeted investigations. Using ORACLs to functionally annotate existing compound libraries could have similar benefits, enabling researchers to quickly identify drugs that are clinically relevant for specific disease pathways, and significantly streamlining the way scientists use the shared drug discovery facilities, or cores, which are common in academic research.  Drug screening cores are very busy   they run continuously,  Wu said.  The problem is that screening results generally cannot be reused. When you have a new biological target you want to hit with a drug, you have to go and screen the whole compound library again.  Shape-shifting cells reveal drug mechanisms Researchers commonly screen for effective drugs using  reporter cells,  which are carefully designed to change their behavior or appearance in response to a successful treatment. But the creation of an ORACL   a single reporter cell line capable of distinguishing between multiple common drug classes   required a different approach.  We didn't know how to design such a versatile reporter cell based on our existing biological knowledge,  said Chien-Hsiang  Charles  Hsu, a graduate student in the Altschuler and Wu lab and co-lead author on the new study.  So we thought, why not just randomly tag proteins and screen the cells with drugs to see which line could produce the response that fit our goal?"" The researchers created an assortment of 93 cell lines, based on an existing line of lung cancer cells, by tagging randomly selected genes with a fluorescent marker. They treated cells from each of these lineages with a panel of 30 compounds belonging to six commonly used classes of cancer drugs, then analyzed images of the cells with custom algorithms. As the team had hoped, different drugs caused cells to change their shape and pattern of fluorescence in distinct ways that enabled the software to deduce which type of drug had been applied. As anticipated, some cell lines were more informative than others: To the researchers  delight, one cell line proved capable of distinguishing between the six drug classes with 94 percent accuracy. Some of the more subtle aspects of the cells  characteristic responses to different drug types required the computer algorithms to detect, but others were obvious under the microscope: DNA damaging drugs caused cells to swell, while HDAC inhibitors produced a spiky appearance. MTOR inhibitors produced dim fluorescence throughout the cell, while treatment with hsp90 inhibitors resulted in fluorescent speckles within the cytoplasm. The researchers had found their ORACL. Oracular cells could screen compound libraries for overlooked drugs To test their ORACL cells, the team screened through more than 10,000 small molecules of unknown function from several institutional compound libraries. Their analysis identified 106 molecules whose effects on the cells matched those of the  training  drugs that had been used to initially select the ORACL, and further experiments confirmed that at least 90 of these matches affected the same biological pathway as the training drug. To the researchers  surprise, ORACL cells also produced characteristic responses to a slew of additional compounds, some of which turned out to belong to drug classes not included in the original training set, including ER and Aurora Kinase inhibitors, glucocorticoid steroids, ATPase inhibitors, and dihihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, as well as a dozen other groups of molecules whose shared biological function is still not known.  What s amazing,  said Altschuler,  is that we were able to do one screen, one time, and fish out molecules that were in many different diverse classes at once.  The researchers are currently scaling up their screens to enable rapid annotation of compound libraries containing hundreds of thousands molecules. They hope that ORACLs will be adopted to identify new compounds that hit biological pathways where current drugs have too many side effects or miss certain patient populations. They could find compounds that affect pathways affected by few known drugs or even drugs whose effects seem far from any known biological pathway.  These are really early steps in drug discovery,  Altschuler said.  We hope finding more high quality compounds will make all the later steps more efficient. Currently the process takes billions of dollars over many, many years. Wouldn't it be nice to make that easier? ","Published: December 16, 2015"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/innovative-way-of-developing-new-drugs-198316,Innovative Way of Developing New Drugs Scientists have developed an innovative way of using one of the biggest problems facing health services antibiotic resistance to develop drugs to combat some of the most intractable diseases  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Amyloid diseases such as Parkinson s, Alzheimer s and type-2 diabetes pose a particular problem for drug designers because they do not present a clear target structure to aim at. Instead of the disease being linked to a single, easily identifiable species such as the active site of an enzyme or a specific receptor, amyloid diseases are associated with heterogeneous accumulations of proteins sticking together.   This is the key reason why many amyloid diseases are currently incurable. The new study outlines a way of using antibiotic resistance to find chemicals capable of stopping amyloid formation.   Professor Sheena Radford, FRS Director of the Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology at the University of Leeds, led the research. She said:  Until now, we haven t had effective ways to identify drugs to combat amyloid formation. Amyloid-prone proteins often don t have a clearly defined structure, which makes it very difficult to identify areas to target with drugs.   Also, because amyloid-causing proteins have a tendency to stick together, they can be very hard to study in the lab. This study shows a way of getting around these problems by grafting amyloid-prone sequences into enzymes which break down antibiotics.  The study, involving researchers in the University s School of Chemistry and the Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, exploits the complex series of adversarial relationships between molecules in a positive way to select for chemicals that counter amyloid formation. First, amyloid-prone sequences from target proteins are attached to antibiotic degrading beta-lactamase enzymes. Bacteria carrying the modified enzymes are combined in laboratory dishes with the antibiotic. Normally, the presence of the beta-lactamase would disable the antibiotic, allowing bacterial growth. However, the amyloid-causing sequences act as  Trojan horses  in the beta-lactamase, preventing it from attacking the antibiotic and therefore stopping the tell-tale bacterial growth. Next, the researchers add chemicals and test whether they disable the amyloid-causing sequences, freeing the beta-lactamase to attack the antibiotic and allowing bacterial growth. Dr Janet Saunders, a researcher on the study, said:  In our research, an old enemy anti-bacterial resistance turns out to be our friend. When we see bacterial growth, we know we have chemicals that are obstructing amyloid formation.  The study identified one chemical L-dopamine that blocks amyloid deposits forming from sequences associated with type II diabetes. However, the real significance of the work is its potential for generic use with any protein associated with amyloid disease. Co-author Dr David Brockwell, Associate Professor in the University s School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, said:  If you can insert a protein sequence into beta-lactamase, you are likely to be able to use this technique as a screen for chemicals capable of inhibiting its aggregation. You can screen thousands of compounds by putting them through this test.  Professor Radford said:  It is important to stress that an efficient screen is only one step in the journey toward drug discovery. The power of our study is that it provides the first step on this path by showing us the type of molecules we should be looking at to inhibit a particular disease-causing protein.  Another application of the new technique could be for use in the manufacture of bio-pharmaceuticals, a class of protein-based drugs that includes many of the highest grossing modern drugs. Dr Brockwell said:  The problem with many of these new protein-based drugs is that they suffer from similar problems to those we see in amyloid diseases; they stick together. This means you can end up with potentially life-saving drugs that you cannot manufacture.   We are investigating whether we can use our technique to work out which biopharmaceuticals will be resistant to aggregation and hence much more likely to be successful as a drug product.  The research was funded through a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) industrial CASE partnership with University of Leeds spinout Avacta Group, an AIM-listed company dedicating to providing transformational tools to life scientists.  Innovate UK and the BBSRC have provided additional funding to explore the technique s use with bio-pharmaceuticals.","Published: December 16, 2015"

Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University have revealed for the first time how a similar mechanism in the eye lens does exactly the same thing. They have discovered that cells in close proximity to each other can sense when a cell is dying due to environmental stressors like UV light, smoke and other pollutants, and eat the cell before it becomes toxic. These researchers not only demonstrate that this happens with lens cells, but they uncover the molecules that are required to do it. They also reveal that the molecules needed for the cells to eat each other are degraded by UV light. And when that happens, the cells lose the ability to eat each other. Since these systems are not confined to the eye lens and diseases of the eye such as cataracts, uncovering the mechanisms and functions will provide important information in more complex tissues and disease states.It has long been known that environmental damage is associated with cell death and that it kills tissue because it is toxic. Yet, the eye lens, which does not have a blood supply, gets hit by UV light and other stressors that continuously kill cells. Consistently, the eye lens has evolved multiple protective and repair systems to preserve its transparent function in the face of environmental insults. So how does it do that?  That s exactly what these researchers sought to understand in this novel study. They were able to establish that the intact eye lens is indeed capable of removing apoptopic lens cell debris and worked to identify a molecular mechanism for this process by lens cells. By using the eye lens as a model, they searched to understand how other cells and tissues might operate in a different way than by using blood cells.    Accumulation of apoptopic material is toxic to epithelial cell populations, which include the cornea, skin, lungs and other tissue, and is associated with the development of multiple autoimmune, inflammatory, aging and degenerative diseases,  said  Marc Kantorow, Ph.D., author of the paper and a professor and director of graduate studies in FAU s College of Medicine.   Identifying the cell systems that protect against the effects of apoptosis-inducing insults is an important step toward understanding and developing therapies to treat these diseases.  Using embryonic chicken lenses, Kantorow and his collaborators Lisa Brennan, Ph.D., associate research professor; Daniel Chauss, a Ph.D. candidate; and Olya Bakina, a Fulbright scholar and graduate student all in FAU s College of Medicine, engineered the eye lens cells to be either fluorescent red or fluorescent green   instead of what would normally be a clear lens cell. They created artificial dead green cells and fed them to the red cells. When the green cells ate the red cells, they turned yellow. They observed this mechanism in real-time using microscopy to track the digesting cells and utilized antibodies to specific molecules to determine which molecules were needed for the cells to eat each other.   It is widely known that cells have very specific functions and that environmental damage is associated with cell death,  said Brennan.  Before this study, the common knowledge was that what removed these dead cells were specialized immune cells that literally go into the tissue and eat these dead cells and that s how your body got rid of them. We looked at the eye lens as a model to try to search for alternate ways to get rid of these dead cells to keep a tissue alive.  The eye lens is one of the most environmentally challenged tissues of the body since it lacks protective pigmentation and resides just behind the transparent and surface exposed cornea. Damage to the lens and its components causes age-related cataract formation that remains a leading cause of visual disability despite advances in surgical treatment options.  Twenty percent of all cataracts are associated with UV light exposure and at some point in their lifetime, most people will get cataracts,  said Kantorow.  Our work has the potential to lead to the development of treatments and therapies that would eliminate the need for surgery, which is the only way to treat cataracts today.

While abnormal immune responses are largely responsible for these diseases, issues relating to gut microbiome, intestinal epithelial cells, immune components and the gut's rhythmic peristalsis motions can also contribute to and exacerbate symptoms. But until now, scientists have been hard-pressed to develop new therapies for treating IBDs due to their inability to replicate the human gut microenvironment in the laboratory. Now, a team at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University co-led by Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., and Wyss Core Faculty member James Collins, Ph.D., has leveraged the Institute's proprietary human-organs-on-chips technology to microengineer a model of human intestinal inflammation and bacterial overgrowth in a human-gut-on-a-chip. The advance for the first time allows scientists to analyze how normal gut microbes and pathogenic bacteria contribute to immune responses, and to investigate IBD mechanisms in a controlled model that recapitulates human intestinal physiology. ""Chronic inflammation of the intestine is thought to be caused by abnormal interactions between gut microbes, intestinal epithelial cells and the immune system, but so far it has been impossible to determine how each of these factors contribute to the development of intestinal bowel disease,"" said Hyun Jung Kim, Ph.D., former Wyss Technology Development Fellow and first author on the study, speaking about the limitations of conventional in vitro and animal models of bacterial overgrowth and inflammation of the intestines. The human gut-on-a-chip technology, however, provides an ideal microenvironment for mimicking the natural conditions of the human intestines in a small-scaled, controllable in vitro platform. The human gut-on-a-chip was first invented at the Wyss Institute in 2012. Made of a clear flexible polymer about the size of a computer memory stick, the hollow-channeled microfluidic device simulates the physical structure, microenvironment, peristalsis-like motion waves and fluid flow of the human intestine. In this latest advance reported in PNAS, the Wyss team showed that the human gut-on-a-chip's unique ability to co-culture intestinal cells with living microbes from the normal gut microbiome for an extended period of time, up to two weeks, could allow breakthrough insights into how the microbial communities that flourish inside our GI tracts contribute to human health and disease. ""The discovery of the microbiome and its significance represents a huge paradigm shift in our understanding of human health   there are more microbes living on us and in us than our own cells,"" said Ingber, who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children's Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Science. ""Until now, use of traditional culture methods and even more sophisticated organoid cultures have prevented the microbiome from being studied beyond one or two days. With our human gut-on-a-chip, we can not only culture the normal gut microbiome for extended times, but we can also analyze contributions of pathogens, immune cells, and vascular and lymphatic endothelium, as well as model specific diseases to understand complex pathophysiological responses of the intestinal tract."" ""There is much to be learned about IBD, as well as how antibiotics impact the microbiome,"" said Collins, who is also Termeer Profesor of Medical Engineering and Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""This technology enables one to study in an isolated and controlled manner the complexity of the microbiome and the role different microbial species play in health and disease. It is therefore a highly valuable platform for discovery and clinical translation efforts."" Already the advance has revealed new discoveries into the inner workings of the human intestinal tract and its immune responses. Four small proteins that stimulate inflammation (called cytokines) were found to work in tandem to trigger inflammatory immune responses that damage and irritate the bowel. This discovery could open a new potential therapeutic pathway to treating IBD by ""blocking"" these cytokine proteins simultaneously. The Wyss team also studied the role fluid flow and the wave-like peristaltic movement of the gut plays in maintaining a dynamic equilibrium of the gut microbiome, finding that absence of peristaltic movement can lead to rampant overgrowth of bacteria completely independent of changes in fluid flow. This could help explain why some patients with IBD and other conditions develop bacterial overgrowth, such as patients who develop ileus, which is a syndrome that can occur following intestinal surgery when there is a prolonged delay in the body's ability to resume normal peristaltic motions. The Wyss team believes the ability of the human gut-on-a-chip to culture the microbiome with human gut cells also holds promise for the field of precision medicine, where a patient's own cells and gut microbiota could one day be cultured inside a gut-on-a-chip for testing different therapies and identifying an individualized treatment strategy. ""Previously the microbiome and its role in human health were largely defined through study of their gene expression, but now, by being able to carry out human experimentation in vitro relating to how the microbiome, human intestinal cells and human immune components interplay, we hope to gain a much deeper understanding of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that will hopefully lead to development of new and more effective therapies,"" said Ingber.","Published: December 16, 2015"

Performed in close collaboration with Saarland University (Dept. Human Genetics, Prof. E. Meese, Clinical Bioinformatics, Prof. A. Keller), the study represents a key advance in translating novel biomarkers from research to clinical use by independent validation of miRNA signatures. As one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths, the diagnosis of lung cancer is challenging because there are no validated minimally invasive screening procedures, late detection is typically associated with poor outcomes, and the differential diagnosis to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is complex. Following-up on an initial screening initiative for miRNA biomarkers in lung cancer (Leidinger et al. 2009), miRNA profiles from the whole blood of 120 patients were analyzed using high-throughput qRT-PCR. The samples included blood from patients diagnosed with the most common type of lung cancer, patients with COPD, as well as healthy controls, and was designed to determine if miRNAs hold promise as a tool for lung cancer screening and differential diagnosis from COPD. The study showed that lung cancer patients could be precisely differentiated from healthy controls and COPD patients by a blood based miRNA signature illustrating its potential for early diagnosis of lung cancer. These preliminary results show strong evidence that blood-based miRNA signatures can be well replicated, have a substantial potential for lung cancer diagnosis, and are novel powerful biomarker candidates for clinical applications.  While this study is small, our methods were able to differentiate a patient with cancer from a disease-free individual with 95% accuracy with a simple blood test.  said Jochen Kohlhaas, Chief Executive Officer of CBC.

It also plays a role in serious psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression.  ""Serotonin essentially modulates every aspect of brain function, including movement,"" Zhang says. The transmitter is made by a small number of neurons localized on one structure at the back of the brain. Serotonin exerts its influence because the neurons that make it project to almost every part of the brain.  The study, reported today in the journal Nature Biotechnology, began with two types of stem cells: one derived from embryos, the other from adult cells. Because serotonin neurons form before birth, the researchers had to recreate the chemical environment found in the developing brain in the uterus, Zhang says.  ""That sounds reasonably simple, and we have made so many different types of neural cells. Here, we had to instruct the stem cells to develop into one specific fate, using a custom-designed sequence of molecules at exact concentrations. That's especially difficult if you consider that the conditions needed to make serotonin neurons are scarce, existing in one small location in the brain during development."" The cells showed the expected response to electrical stimulation and also produced serotonin. Although other scientists have matured stem cells into something resembling serotonin neurons, the case is much more conclusive this time, says first author Jianfeng Lu, a scientist at UW-Madison's Waisman Center. ""Previously, labs were producing a few percent of serotonin neurons from pluripotent stem cells, and that made it very difficult to study their cells. If you detect 10 neurons, and only two are serotonin neurons, it's impossible to detect serotonin release; that was the stone in the road."" Instead, those neurons were identified based on cellular markers, which is ""not sufficient to say those are functional serotonin neurons,"" Lu says.  To confirm that the new cells act like serotonin neurons, ""we showed that the neurons responded to some FDA-approved drugs that regulate depression and anxiety through the serotonin pathway,"" Zhang says.  While the previous attempts ""followed what was learned from mouse studies,"" the current study used other growth factors, Zhang says. ""It was not exactly trial and error; we have some rules to follow, but we had to refine it little by little to work out - one chemical at a time - the concentration and timing, and then check and recheck the results. That's why it took time."" Although cells derived from stem cells are commonly used to test drug toxicity, Zhang is aiming higher with the serotonin neurons. ""We think these can help develop new, more effective drugs, especially related to the higher neural functions that are so difficult to model in mice and rats,"" he says. ""Particularly because they are from humans, these cells may lead to benefits for patients with depression, bipolar disorder or anxiety. These are some of the most troublesome psychiatric conditions, and we really don't have great drugs for them now."" Because the neurons can be generated from induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be produced from a patient's skin cells, ""these could be useful for finding treatments for psychiatric disorders like depression, where we often see quite variable responses to drugs,"" says Lu. ""By identifying individual differences, this could be a step toward personalized medicine.  ""I'm like Su-Chun. I don't want to just make a publication in a scientific journal.

The study, which is published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, describes a possible mechanism for how the gene variant produces clinical symptoms by affecting levels of specific proteins in the brain. ""We've identified a gene variant linked to specific psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment in people with bipolar disorder,"" says Mikael Land n, researcher at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics and the Sahlgrenska Academy's Department of Neuroscience and Physiology. ""The link to cognitive symptoms is particularly interesting, since there are no treatments currently available to improve problems with attention, memory and concentration, which impact heavily on functional outcome and recoverability."" Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia can largely be attributed to inherited factors. In recent years, scientists have identified specific gene variants that increase the risk of these diseases, but these risk variants only go some way to explaining why some people are afflicted by the disease and others are not. We currently do not know how these genetic risk factors affect the chemistry of the brain and cause specific symptoms, so it is not yet possible for scientists to design drugs to relieve symptoms shown by people with a particular genetic variant. To link, at a molecular level, a gene variant with biochemical changes and clinical symptoms related to a heritable psychiatric disorder, as in this present study, is therefore something of a breakthrough. The study involved people with bipolar disorder from the St. G ran project being run in Stockholm and Gothenburg. Besides carefully mapping the participants' specific symptoms, the scientists also tested their cognitive abilities and measured levels of different proteins in their blood and CSF, a fluid that surrounds the brain and that thus gives a good indication of its chemistry. On performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS), they found that a genetic variant of the SNX7 gene was associated with both the levels of a protein in the CSF, known as kynurenic acid, and the disease symptoms. ""We then conducted a series of supplementary experiments to identify a probable signal pathway, from the occurrence of the genetic risk variant to clinical symptoms in the form of psychosis and cognitive impairment,"" says Professor Land n. ""The pathway mainly involves signalling via the brains' immune cells, and thus differs from how today's drugs operate. What we're hoping, therefore, is that the new mechanisms we've discovered will help in the development of more targeted drugs, where existing immune-modulating drugs can also be of interest.""

The degree of weakness was correlated to the severity of the children s inattention symptoms, the researchers found.  The researchers focused on the salience network, which is a set of brain regions that work together through well-synchronized neural activity to help decide where one s attention should be directed. In most children, this network can assess the importance of internal and external events, and then regulate other thoughts to focus attention in the right place.  A lot of things may be happening in one s environment, but only some grab our attention,  said Vinod Menon, PhD, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and the study s senior author.  The salience network helps us stop daydreaming or thinking about something that happened yesterday so we can focus on the task at hand. We found that this network s ability to regulate interactions with other brain systems is weaker in kids with ADHD.  More than 6 million children in the United States, or 11 percent of children aged 4 to 17, have received ADHD diagnoses. The disorder is characterized by impulsiveness, hyperactivity and difficulty paying attention. Kids with ADHD tend to struggle in school, have trouble with friendships and be more prone to injury than other children their age. At present, diagnosing ADHD is quite subjective, with different thresholds of behavior used to make the diagnosis in different places. For instance, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2011, 7.3 percent of California children had at some point been diagnosed with ADHD, making the state one of five nationwide with diagnosis rates below 8 percent among children. At the other end of the spectrum, six states had rates above 15 percent.  It would be very beneficial to have a diagnostic measure that uses more objective and reliable measures, not just clinical and parental assessments of behavior,  said Weidong Cai, PhD, an instructor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences and the study s lead author.  This study  also demonstrates that we can develop a very robust biomarker based on functional neuroimaging to reliably differentiate children with ADHD from other kids.  Menon s team studied functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans from 180 children, half with ADHD and half without. The scans were taken when the children were awake but resting quietly. The children were also assessed for ADHD symptoms using traditional diagnostic methods. All study data were obtained from the ADHD-200 Consortium, an open-source database of fMRI scans and other clinical characteristics of hundreds of children with or without ADHD. The new results are noteworthy in part because they were replicated in independent data sets from three different sites in New York, Portland and Beijing that contributed to the consortium. The team scored each brain scan according to the synchronization between the salience network and two other related brain networks: the default mode network, a set of brain regions that directs self-referential activities such as daydreaming; and the central executive network, which manipulates information in working memory. To focus one s attention, the salience network must turn down the activity of the default mode network while turning up the activity of the central executive network. Menon and colleagues have previously proposed that poor coordination between these three brain networks could underlie a variety of psychiatric and neurologic problems, including depression, schizophrenia, brain injury, autism and drug addiction. The children with ADHD had weaker interactions between these networks than children without the condition. The difference was large enough that brain scans could distinguish kids who had ADHD from those who did not. Among children with ADHD, worse scores on clinical tests of inattentiveness were linked with weaker interactions between the three brain networks.  These three brain networks come up over and over in pretty much every cognitive task we ask subjects to do,  said Menon, who holds the Rachael L. and Walter F. Nichols, MD, Professorship.  They are critical for information processing and attending to stimuli in the environment.  Future research is needed to explore whether fMRI can also differentiate between the brains of children with ADHD and those with other psychiatric or neurodevelopmental conditions, the researchers said. Answering that question is an important aspect of determining whether brain scans could become a practical component of ADHD diagnosis.

Of the US service members returning from recent conflicts, more than 300,000 of were diagnosed with mTBI between 2000 and 2015, according to the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center. Current assessment of mTBI relies heavily on behavioral observations and on patient recall of events, such as post-traumatic amnesia and loss of consciousness. The need for a more definitive marker spurred Gerard Riedy, MD, PhD, from the National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE) at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., to look at advanced brain imaging with MRI as a tool for assessing mTBI. ""Working at Walter Reed, I saw people with mTBI get routine brain scans and I thought we could do better,"" Dr. Riedy said. In what represents the largest study using advanced brain imaging of active military ever performed, Dr. Riedy and colleagues used MRI to study 834 military service members with mTBI related to blast injuries. Slightly more than 84 percent of the patients reported one or more blast-related incidents, and 63 percent reported loss of consciousness at the time of injury.

Credit: RSNA  The MRI scans revealed the presence of white matter T2 hyperintensities, which can be thought of as brain scars, in 52 percent of the mTBI patients. ""We were really surprised to see so much damage to the brain in the mTBI patients,"" Dr. Riedy said. ""It's expected that people with mTBI should have normal MRI results, yet more than 50 percent had these abnormalities."" Pituitary abnormalities were identified in almost a third of mTBI patients. The pituitary, the so-called ""master gland"" that governs other endocrine gland functions, is located in the base of the brain. Previous research has shown a decline in pituitary function in soldiers who experienced mTBI, perhaps because of blast-related trauma. The findings represent the first in a series of new studies from the NICoE on advanced brain imaging in mTBI patients, according to Riedy. ""This paper is just the tip of the iceberg,"" he said. ""We have several more papers coming up that build on these findings and look at brain function, brain wiring, connectivity and perfusion, or brain blood flow."" As the research team builds a database of advanced imaging data, they hope to begin to link the data with the more subjective symptoms associated with mTBI. ""A scar on a brain scan is an objective finding,"" Riedy said. ""We start with the objective and build a foundation for the correct diagnosis of mTBI and then bring in the subjective measures later.""

Symptoms of TBI and PTSD overlap, and treatments for one are unlikely to work for the other. ""An objective measure of traumatic brain injury can lead to proper therapies,"" Riedy said. The ability to see the brain scans has already had an impact on military personnel and their families, Riedy noted, allowing them to see for the first time what has previously been called the invisible wounds of war.

Rather than relying on the amount of light reflecting off metal particles, this novel process, presented in the journal eLife, involves delivering light energy to silver or gold nanoparticles deposited on neurons and imaging the higher energy levels resulting from their vibrations, known as surface plasmons. This technique is particularly effective as the light emitted from metal particles is resistant to fading, meaning that decades-old tissue samples achieved through other processes, such as the Golgi stain method from the late 1880s, can be imaged repeatedly. The new process was achieved by using spectral detection on a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM), first made available in the late 1980s and, until now, used most extensively for fluorescent imaging. Paired with such methods, silver- and gold-based cell labeling is poised to unlock new information in a myriad of archived specimens. Furthermore, silver-impregnated preparations should retain their high image quality for a century or more, allowing for archivability that could aid in clinical research and disease-related diagnostic techniques for cancer and neurological disorders. ""For the purposes of medical diagnostics, older and newer specimens could be compared with the knowledge that signal intensity would remain fairly uniform regardless of sample age or repeated light exposure,"" says contributing author Karen Mesce from the University of Minnesota. ""With the prediction that superior resolution microscopic techniques will continue to evolve, older archived samples could be reimagined with newer technologies and with the confidence that the signal in question was preserved. The progression or stability of a cancer or other disease could therefore be charted with accuracy over long periods of time."" To appreciate the enhanced image quality produced by the new technique, the team first examined a conventional brightfield image of a metal-labelled neuron within a grasshopper's abdominal ganglion, a type of mini-brain which, even at that size, presented out-of-focus structures. They then imaged the same ganglion with the spectral LSCM adjusted to the manufacturer's traditional fluorescence settings, resulting only in strong natural fluorescence and a collective dark blur in place of the silver-labelled neurons. However, after collecting the light energy emitted from vibrating surface plasmons in the spectral LSCM, the team obtained spectacular three-dimensional computer images of silver and gold-impregnated neurons. This holds enormous potential for stimulating a re-examination of archived preparations, including Golgi-stained and cobalt/silver-labelled nervous systems. Additionally, by using a number of different metal-based cell-labeling techniques in combination with the new LSCM protocols, tissue and cell specimens can be generated and imaged with ease and in great three-dimensional detail. Changes in even small structural details of neurons can be identified, which are often important indicators of neurological disease, learning and memory, and brain development. ""Both new and archived preparations are essentially permanent and the information gathered from them increases the data available for characterizing neurons as individuals or as members of classes for comparative studies, adding to emerging neuronal banks,"" says co-first author Karen Thompson from Agnes Scott College. ""Just as plasmon resonance can explain the continued intensity of the red (caused by silver nanoparticles) and yellow (gold nanoparticles) colors in centuries-old medieval stained glass and other works of art, metal-impregnated neurons are also likely never to fade, neither in the information they provide nor in their intrinsic beauty,"" adds Mesce. eLifeThompson KJ et al.

It could be because they need more sugar to get that same sweet taste. According to new research from the Monell Center, sensitivity to sweet taste varies widely across school-aged children and is in part genetically-determined. The findings may inform efforts to reduce sugar consumption and improve nutritional health of children. ""Some children are twenty times better at detecting sugar than others. As sugar becomes more restricted and even regulated in children's diets, the less sugar-sensitive children may get less of a 'sweet signal' and therefore have a harder time dealing with sugar reduction,"" said study author Danielle Reed, PhD, a behavioral geneticist at Monell. In the study, published online ahead of print in the Journal of Nursing Research, the researchers determined the sweet taste threshold, defined as the lowest detectable level of sucrose, of 216 healthy children between the ages of 7 and 14. Each child was given two cups, one containing distilled water and the other containing a sugar solution and asked to indicate which contained a taste. This procedure was repeated across a wide range of sugar concentrations: the lowest concentration that the child could reliably distinguish from water was designated as that child's sweet detection threshold (a lower taste threshold means the child is more sensitive to that taste). Detection thresholds varied across a large range. The most sensitive child required the equivalent of only 0.005 teaspoon of sugar dissolved in a cup of water to detect sweetness, whereas the least sensitive needed three teaspoons to get the same sensation. To explore genetic influences on sweet taste perception, DNA from 168 of the children was analyzed to identify variation in two sweet taste genes known to be related to sweet sensitivity in adults: the TAS1R3 G-coupled protein sweet receptor gene and the GNAT3 sweet receptor signaling gene. An additional analysis identified variation in the TAS2R38 bitter receptor gene, which is known to be related to individual differences in sweet preferences among children. Small changes in each of these genes are associated with differential sensitivity of the respective receptor to its activating taste stimuli. Genotype analyses revealed that sucrose thresholds and sensitivity were related to variation in the bitter receptor gene, but not in the two sweet receptor genes. Specifically, children whose TAS2R38 receptor gene variants make them more bitter-sensitive were also more sensitive to sucrose. Dietary records revealed that children having this same bitter-sensitive gene variant consume a higher percentage of their daily calories as added sugar. ""We were surprised to find that sweet taste sensitivity and sugar consumption were related to a bitter receptor gene. This will make us look harder at how we have cubby-holed taste genes into discrete categories and prompt us to explore whether sucrose and other sugars can directly activate bitter receptors,"" said Reed. Using bioelectrical impedance to measure body composition, the researchers also asked whether sweet sensitivity might relate to measures of obesity and were surprised to find that increased body fat was associated with greater sensitivity to sweet taste. ""Our assumption was that the more obese children would be insensitive to sugar and therefore would need higher concentrations to get the same pleasing effect as leaner children,"" said paper lead author Paule Valery Joseph, PhD, who was a doctoral student at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing and Visiting Fellow at Monell at the time the paper was written. ""This was not the case and to our surprise, children having more body fat were more sensitive to sugar and were able to detect a sweet taste at lower concentrations of sucrose."" Moving forward, Joseph, a nurse-scientist who currently is a Clinical & Translational Postdoctoral Fellow at the National Institute of Nursing Research, would like to examine additional measures of dietary intake and body composition to achieve a clearer understanding of the potential relationships of taste, obesity and other metabolic conditions. She comments, ""Better nutrition therapies are critically needed. Our ultimate goal is to bring the assessment from bench to bedside to create tailored interventions using 'precision nutrition' for both children and adults.""

The secret, according to a new study, is that our sleep is more efficient. Researchers from Duke University scoured the scientific literature and compiled a database of slumber patterns across hundreds of mammals including 21 species of primates from baboons and lemurs to orangutans, chimpanzees and people. They then used statistical techniques to account for each species  position in the primate family tree. They found that humans are exceptionally short sleepers getting by on an average of seven hours of sleep a night, whereas other primate species, such as southern pig-tailed macaques and gray mouse lemurs, need as many as 14 to 17 hours. What s more, our sleep tends to be more efficient, meaning we spend a smaller proportion of time in light stages of sleep, and more of our sleep time in deeper stages of sleep. A dream state called rapid eye movement sleep, or REM, for example, makes up nearly 25 percent of our overall sleep. But in primates such as mouse lemurs, mongoose lemurs and African green monkeys, REM sleep barely climbs above five percent.  Humans are unique in having shorter, higher quality sleep,  said anthropologist and study co-author David Samson of Duke, who logged nearly 2,000 hours watching orangutans in REM and non-REM sleep as part of his dissertation research prior to coming to Duke. The human sleep gap isn t merely the result of round-the-clock access to artificial light from street lamps and computer screens, the researchers say. A separate study of the sleep habits of people living in three hunter-gatherer societies without electricity in Tanzania, Namibia and Bolivia found they get slightly less shut-eye than those of us with electronic gadgets. If artificial light and other aspects of modern life were solely responsible for shortening our sleep, we d expect hunter-gatherer societies without access to electricity to sleep more, Samson said. Rather, the study by Samson and Duke anthropologist Charlie Nunn suggests that humans replaced sleep quantity with sleep quality long before the glare of smartphones came to be. The researchers attribute the shift towards shorter, more efficient sleep in part to the transition from sleeping in  beds  in the trees, as our early human ancestors probably did, to sleeping on the ground as we do today. Once on the ground, Samson said, early humans likely started sleeping near fire and in larger groups in order to keep warm and ward off predators such as leopards and hyenas habits which could have enabled our ancestors to get the most out of their sleep in the shortest time possible. Shorter sleep also freed up time that could be devoted to other things, like learning new skills and forging social bonds, while deeper sleep helped to cement those skills, sharpen memory and boost brain power, Samson said.

Nothing could be simpler: a drop of blood is placed on a special carrier substance; after a wait of a few minutes, the slide is placed on a device that emits polarised light thanks to an inexpensive polarisation filter. It is covered with a lid containing a second polarisation filter, which blocks the light from all materials except crystalline or materials with directional properties. If light is visible through the cross-polariser filter, a positive diagnosis is made. Through this an immediate  yes or no  screening is possible. It is also possible to measure the light intensity, and thus the amount of the pathogen, through a simple light meter plugged into a smartphone and controlled via an app. What sounds almost like science fiction has now become reality. The research group led by Raffaele Mezzenga, Professor of Food and Soft Materials, has recently published a scientific paper in which it introduces a new rapid test that can detect not only malaria parasites but also viruses such as HIV or Ebola, diverse bacteria or biomarkers, like glucose or cholesterol. The detection methods are not only extremely fast; they are also considerably less expensive when compared with other detection methods. The polarisation device costs just CHF 20, says Jijo Vallooran, first author of the paper, which has just been published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials. Exploited birefringence Although the concept behind this new technology is very general and appears so easy to operate, the scientific basis underlying the invention of the ETH researchers is extremely complex. The scientists use the phenomenon of birefringence of polarised light from the lipid based lyotropic liquid crystals, which consist of self-assembled structures of fat molecules in water. The group of Prof. Mezzenga has been working with these liquid crystals for long time and exploits them also for other applications, such as drug delivery and protein crystallisation. Lyotropic liquid crystals organise themselves into special networks with unique symmetry, which means that their basic motif repeats itself periodically. In the case of liquid crystal cubic phases, the channels are made of lipid bilayer membranes in water and have a diameter of just a few nanometres, so only few free water molecules are available in the liquid crystal, whereas the majority is bound to the channel walls. These liquid crystal cubic phases are isotropic, or so to say, do not have any birefringent properties, which means that if a slide with a layer of lyotropic liquid crystal films is placed under a light source that allows polarised light to pass through, it appears black when observed through another polarizer tilted at 90 . Enzymatic reactions generate a signal  Birefringence pattern of a sample positive to Ebola infection. (Image: ETH Zurich/Jijo Vallooran) To achieve birefringence and thus receive a signal, the researchers reached again into their bag of tricks: they added certain enzymes to the liquid crystal to allow a chemical reaction to take place in the nanotubes. Since only a small amount of water is freely available in the nanotubes, the products of the reactions precipitated together to form crystals, which are themselves birefringent. A closer look at the sample through a second polarisation filter placed above it and perpendicular to the first shows a light pattern in instances where the enzyme has reacted with the substance tested.  This birefringence pattern is the only signal that we need to use for diagnostics and analysis,  says Mezzenga. At the beginning of their research, the scientists tested their system with chemical compounds that can be enzymatically converted. They then refined their method and adapted it for medically relevant substances, such as glucose and cholesterol. In further steps, they broadened the scope to tests on bacteria and viruses, starting with the HIV virus. Eventually, Mezzenga, Vallooran and colleagues, were able to show that their method could also be adapted to diagnose malaria caused byPlasmodium parasites.  Plasmodium parasite invades erythrocytes and digests haemoglobin. The heme component, which is toxic to the parasites, is crystallised and thus has inherently birefringent surfaces. So it s not necessary to mark it with antibodies and no enzymatic reaction is required  explains Mezzenga. Normally, viruses and bacteria must be made visible and chemically active with specific antibodies with enzymes coupled to them before they can be detected by birefringence. Flexible, inexpensive, practical  Our test system can be extended to a large number of different viruses or bacteria. It is totally flexible,  stresses Vallooran. As it is so easy to use and because only one set of antibody-enzyme conjugates is necessary to detect viruses, the ETH researchers believe it can be used particularly in areas where expensive laboratory equipment is otherwise unaffordable.  Other than a refrigerator to store the antibodies and enzymes, the user needs only the box to detect the polarised light and the lipid carrier substance. This is very inexpensive,  says Vallooran. Pathogens such as HIV or even Ebola can be detected very rapidly, and a reliable result received within less than an hour.  Our technology is very suitable for use in the field and the early detection of diseases.  Vallooran received an ETH Pioneer Fellowship for his research in this technology. The researchers have also filed a patent application for the new technology.  We want to produce something genuinely useful,  says Vallooran. The potential for this method of detection is extremely high, particularly when new diseases that spread rapidly flare up, such as Malaria or Ebola. But more funding is still needed to bring the development to the market and the ETH researchers are actively working on it.","Published: December 15, 2015"

In a new study Rutgers scientists isolated and profiled cells releasing these sub-micron sized bubbles, known as extracellular vesicles (EVs) in adult C. elegans and identified 335 genes that provide significant information about the biology of EVs and their relationship to human diseases. They and colleagues from Princeton University, the University of Oxford and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, determined that 10 percent of the 335 identified genes in the roundworm regulate the formation, release, and possible function of the EVs. Understanding how EVs are made, dispersed and communicate with other cells can shed light on the difference between EVs carrying sickness or health. ""These EV's are exciting but scary because we don't know what the mechanisms are that decide what is packaged inside them."" said Maureen Barr, lead author and a professor in the Department of Genetics in Rutgers' School of Arts and Sciences. ""It's like getting a letter in the mail and you don't know whether it's a letter saying that you won the lottery or a letter containing anthrax."" For decades scientists believed that the EV material released by some human cells - which can only be seen through high-tech electron microscopes - was nothing more than biological debris. While this theory has changed - with researchers now having a better understanding of the role these EVs play in cancer, infectious diseases and neurodegenerative disorders - scientists still aren't certain how they are made or why the same parcels can result in different outcomes. But Barr said using C. elegans, which have many genes similar to humans, Rutgers scientists have identified new pathways that could control the production of EVs and the cargo they carry, including the proteins responsible for polycystic kidney disease, the most commonly inherited disease in humans. The polycystic kidney disease gene products are secreted in tiny EVs from both humans and worms and no one knows why these proteins are in the EVs, she said. ""The knowledge gained from this tiny worm is essential for determining the biological significance of EVs, for understanding their relationship to human diseases like polycystic kidney disease, and for harnessing their potential therapeutic uses, ""Barr said. Because EVs are found in bodily fluids like urine, blood and cerebral spinal fluid, Barr said it is nearly impossible to determine the cellular source from which they are derived. This is why very little is known about how EVs are made and how the molecular cargo is released. By understanding how a cell makes and packages proteins, lipids and nucleic acids into EVs, Barr said, pharmaceutical treatments and therapies could be developed, for instance, that would prevent cancer cells from producing EVs carrying cargo necessary for tumor growth. ""When we know exactly how they work, scientists will be able to use EVs for our advantage,"" said Barr. ""This means that pathological EVs that cause disease could be blocked and therapeutic EVs that can help heal can be designed to carry beneficial cargo.""","Published: December 15, 2015"

Even though the released nutrients are energetically costly to produce, bacteria benefit from nutrients their bacterial partners provide in return. Hence, this process is a cooperative exchange of metabolites. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology and the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena have shown that bacteria, which do not actively contribute to metabolite production, can be excluded from the cooperative benefits. The research team demonstrated that cooperative cross-feeding interactions that grow on two-dimensional surfaces are protected from being exploited by opportunistic, non-cooperating bacteria. Under these conditions, non-cooperating bacteria are spatially excluded from the exchanged amino acids. This protective effect probably stabilizes cooperative cross-feeding interactions in the long-run. The Research Group  Experimental Ecology and Evolution  headed by Christian Kost is investigating how cooperative interactions between organisms have evolved. In this context, the scientists study a special type of division of labor that is very common in nature, namely the reciprocal exchange of nutrients among unicellular bacteria. For these tiny organisms it is often advantageous to divide the labor of certain metabolic processes rather than performing all biochemical functions autonomously. Bacteria that engage in this cooperative exchange of nutrients can save a significant amount of energy. Indeed, in a previous study, the researchers could already demonstrate that this division-of-metabolic-labor can positively affect bacterial growth. In the new study, they addressed the question how such cooperative interactions can persist if non-cooperating bacteria consume amino acids without providing nutrients in return. The evolutionary disadvantage that results for cooperative cells could lead to a collapse of the cross-feeding interaction. To experimentally verify this possibility, the scientists have monitored co-cultures of cooperating and non-cooperating bacteria. For this, they genetically engineered  cooperators  of two bacterial species that released increased amounts of certain amino acids into their environment.  As a matter of fact, non-cooperators grew better than cooperators in a well-mixed liquid medium, because under these conditions, they had an unrestricted access to the amino acids in the medium. Their growth, however, was considerably reduced when placed on a two-dimensional surface,  said Kost, summarizing the results of the experiments. A more detailed analysis revealed that non-cooperating bacteria could only exist at the very fringe of colonies consisting of cooperating bacteria. For their study the scientists combined different methods and techniques. The basis formed a new research approach called  synthetic ecology , in which certain mutations are rationally introduced into bacterial genomes. The resulting bacterial mutants are then co-cultured and their ecological interactions analyzed. In parallel, colleagues at the Friedrich Schiller University from the Department of Bioinformatics developed computer models to simulate these interactions. Finally, chemical analyses using mass spectrometric imaging was instrumental for visualizing the bacterial metabolites. Only the combination of microbiological methods with chemical-analytic approaches and computer simulations enabled the scientists to understand and elucidate this phenomenon.   The fact that such a simple principle can effectively stabilize such a complex interaction suggests that similar phenomena may play important roles in natural bacterial communities,  Christian Kost states. After all, bacteria occur predominantly in so-called biofilms   these are surface-attached slime layers that consist of many bacterial species. Known examples include bacteria causing dental plaque or bacterial communities that are used in wastewater treatment plants. Moreover, biofilms are highly relevant for medical research: They do not only play important roles for many infectious diseases by protecting bacterial pathogens from antibiotics or the patients  immune responses, but are also highly problematic when colonizing and spreading on the surfaces of medical implants.  This new study has elucidated that cooperating bacteria form cell clusters and in this way exclude non-cooperating bacteria from their community.  The importance of this mechanism is due to the fact that no complicated or newly-evolved condition, such as the recognition of potential cooperation partners, needs to be fulfilled to effectively stabilize this long-term partnership. Two cooperating bacterial strains and a two-dimensional surface are sufficient for this protective effect to occur , explains Kost. The study raises many new exciting questions the researchers plan to address in the future. For example, they are interested in whether or not similar synergistic effects occur when more than two bacterial partners are involved. In their natural habitats, it is likely that more than two bacterial species participate in such cooperative interactions, leading to rather complex interaction networks. Moreover, amino acid-producing bacterial mutants were synthetically generated for this study. Whether also naturally evolved  cooperators  that occur in a habitat like soil show similar dynamics, remains to be verified. Given that bacteria frequently occur in biofilms, cooperative cross-feeding is probably much more widespread than previously thought. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that promote or inhibit bacterial growth could thus provide important clues on how to fight harmful bacteria or to better use beneficial ones.","Published: December 15, 2015"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/suicide-gene-therapy-kills-prostate-tumor-cells-210761,Suicide Gene Therapy Kills Prostate Tumor Cells Results from a long term clinical trial conducted by cancer researchers at Houston Methodist Hospital show that combining radiation treatment with  suicide gene therapy   a technique in which prostate cancer cells are genetically modified so they signal a patient s immune system to attack them  provides a safe and effective one two punch against the disease  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The researchers compared two arms of patients and report high five-year overall survival rates of 97 percent and 94 percent, respectively. That's a five to 20 percent improvement for survival over historical studies.  Sixty-six prostate cancer patients participated in the Phase II clinical trial between 1999 and 2003 and were split into two groups. One group with cancer cells confined to the prostate, designated Arm A, received only radiotherapy while the other with a more aggressive prostate cancer, Arm B, received both radiation and hormonal therapies. Patients in Arm A received the experimental gene therapy twice during the study, while the Arm B group received the treatment three times.""We strategically used an adenovirus, similar to the one that causes the common cold, to carry the therapy agent--a herpes virus gene that produces the enzyme thymidine kinase, or TK--directly into the tumor cells,"" said E. Brian Butler, M.D., chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology at Houston Methodist and senior author on the JRO paper. ""Once the herpes virus gene was delivered and it started manufacturing TK, we gave patients a commonly used anti-herpes drug, valacyclovir. The combination attacked the herpes DNA, and the TK-producing tumor cells self-destructed, which is why the procedure is called 'suicide gene therapy.'"" Butler said that once the activated valacyclovir (trade name: Valtrex) starts destroying tumor cells, it also alerts the patient's immune system, previously unaware of the cancer's presence, that it is time to launch a massive attack. ""We have created a vaccine with the patient's own cancer cells, a treatment that complements, and may even enhance, what we can achieve with traditional radiation and hormonal therapies,"" said Butler, professor of radiation oncology, Weill Cornell Medicine. According to the results reported in the JRO paper, the long-term outcome for prostate cancer patients receiving gene therapy in combination with radiotherapy with or without hormonal therapy is promising. The 62 patients in both arms who completed the clinical trial had remarkably high five-year freedom from failure rates, meaning no indication by biochemical testing of cancer recurrence, of 94 percent and 91 percent, respectively. Prostate biopsies performed at 24 months after completion of treatment were negative in 83 percent of Arm A patients and 79 percent of Arm B patients. For all evaluative factors, the outcomes were remarkably higher than those achieved with radiotherapy alone (in data taken from historical studies used as controls). ""This is extremely pleasing to us, considering we had patients enrolled in our protocol after other physicians deemed them incurable,"" said Bin Teh, M.D., vice chair of Houston Methodist's Department of Radiation Oncology and lead author on the JRO paper. ""We firmly believe this will be a viable treatment strategy."" Adding to the impressive therapeutic results, Teh said, is the fact that the majority of patients in the clinical trial experienced little or no side effects or complications. A Phase III patient trial, the final safety and efficacy evaluation for the in-situ immunomodulatory gene therapy before it can be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is already underway. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and causes significant mortality.","Published: December 15, 2015"

For one, most diseases are incredibly complex, with very few caused by a single gene mutation. Rather, the more accurate picture is many acting genes acting in concert, with the routes to disease looking like public transit or subway maps. Since then, efforts such as the modENCODE project - a $57 million multi-center initiative funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) - have been aimed at identifying all the genome elements that can turn on and off genes. Now, an international scientific team, led by Arizona State University professor and Biodesign Institute researcher Marco Mangone, has added a new worldwide resource with the first library built for researchers to explore genes' deep and hidden messages.   The end of the message ""If the genome is considered the blueprint of the cell, proteins are the really bricks and mortars,"" said Josh LaBaer, director of the Virginia Piper Center for Personalized Diagnostics, which aims to undercover the telltale early warning signs of disease from a systematic study of all of the proteins in the human body, a field called proteomics. But to make proteins, first the DNA genomic information must be transcribed with complete fidelity, chemical letter by letter into an intermediary molecule, called messenger RNA, or mRNA. In what is known as the central dogma of biology, DNA makes RNA, which makes protein. Marco Mangone, a core faculty member in LaBaer's center, has devoted his career to looking at a peculiar region found at the ends of the mRNA sequence information, called untranslated elements, or UTRs. As the name suggests, these regions do not go on to make protein, but stresses Mangone: ""They have to be there for a reason."" Mangone's raison d'etre is to understand the function of every UTR in the human body, called the 3'UTRome (3' indicates a location at the end of the mRNA). And so he and his team have painstakingly put together the first and largest human 3'UTRome library in the world. It is made up of 1,461 human 3'UTRs to date (representing about 10 percent of genome), and freely available to the worldwide scientific community to explore all aspects of biology, gene regulation and disease. Shooting the messenger Sophocles first wrote in his Greek civil war play ""Antigone"": ""no one loves the messenger who brings bad news."" And when all roads led to ancient Rome, and messengers were sent about delivering the news, a revolutionary change occurred in communications tactics: killing the messenger to prevent the communication from taking place. Mangone, a native Italian who did his doctoral studies in Rome, has harkened back to this strategy when examining the role of the 3'UTRome. His lab uses standard molecular biology and bioinformatics tools to study the production, function and disease contributions of UTRs and their role in governing gene expression. He pioneered this work in a simple animal, the worm C. elegans, and now, in the new BMC paper, toward human genomics. Why would this elaborate system be in place? Based on numerous studies, the role of the 3'UTRome is complicated, but one major theme that has emerged is to prevent the mRNA message from ever being delivered, or in biology terms, ever translated into protein. Small RNAs, called micro RNAs (miRNAs), work to pair with a UTR to block translation, killing the message, and thus, silencing a gene. Uncovering the interplay between miRNA and their specific UTRs have become a hot area in biology, and big business. Big pharma, big future These gene silencers have become all the rage in the pharmaceutical industry. So much so, that the global miRNA research market was valued at nearly $295.1 million in 2011 and is expected to reach $763 million by 2017. It's become big business because of their potential as therapeutics for the treatment of some severe diseases, including cancer and genetic disorders, by introducing specific miRNAs into diseased cells to silence the defective gene. A broad portfolio of miRNA pathway drug candidates have been developed, some already in Phase II clinical trials, showing promising clinical data in different areas of medicine, such as cancer, HCV infection, and cardiovascular diseases. Mangone's team, which involved an international collaboration with Dublin City University, demonstrated the feasibility and potential of their human 3'UTRome library by screening a panel of 87 3'UTRs for targeting by two miRNAs: let-7c, which is implicated in tumor formation, and miR-221, implicated in atherosclerosis and heart disease. After screening, the panel was enriched with genes involved in the RAS cancer signaling pathway, and the team identified many novel targets for the two miRNAs, as well as new genes implicated in tumor formation and heart disease. Mangone ultimately seeks to map all the UTR targets for every miRNA, and to accelerate discovery, has made the first high-quality human 3'UTRome library available to researchers worldwide. ""Once we have this in place, we will be able to build the framework for understanding the underlying commonalities between gene networks,"" said Mangone.","Published: December 15, 2015"

This is particularly significant in Russia where the healthcare system has some unmet needs for biotherapies and blood plasma products. The annual usage of certain classes of these medicines in Russia is much lower than it should be. For example, consumption of immunoglobulins in Russia per capita is 10 to 20 times lower than in the USA and some European countries. With operations in over 30 countries, CSL Behring focuses on developing novel, protein-based therapies for the treatment of bleeding disorders, immune deficiencies, inherited respiratory disease and hereditary angioedema, and for neurological disorders in certain markets. CSL Behring is a subsidiary of CSL Limited. CSL CEO and Managing Director Paul Perreault, who joined Russian healthcare leaders and patient advocates at the office opening, said the new office enables CSL Behring to partner more closely with the Russian Federation, healthcare providers, patient groups and the scientific community. He noted CSL Behring will be closer to patients, listen to them more carefully, and better understand their medical needs. The company currently has seven products registered in Russia.  It is this process of listening and engaging that enhances our ability to deliver new and innovative medicines that make such a huge difference in people s lives,  Perreault said. He added that it will now be easier to launch products in Russia and offer new therapy options to doctors and their patients. In addition, CSL Behring is investigating opportunities to contribute to the development of the Russian pharmaceutical industry, and identify the best ways to partner with the Russian government. As an example, because the amount of human plasma that is currently collected in Russia is insufficient to meet the growing demand for protein-based medicines, Perreault said it may be possible to transfer CSL Behring s plasma collection technology to Russia, and initiate toll manufacturing in that country. Over the last five years, CSL has invested more than $2 billion in R&D, employing more than 1,100 R&D experts.  We are fortunate to have a robust R&D pipeline, with many projects within each stage of development,  Perreault said at the opening.  Our world-class commercial operation, combined with our large and focused R&D team and operational excellence, enable us to quickly identify, develop and deliver innovations that patients and healthcare providers want. We are excited to expand the availability of our lifesaving therapies in Russia.  According to Perreault, CSL has made significant advancements in its recombinant factor development program for the treatment of hemophilia.  Once approved, our recombinant factor IX fusion protein for hemophilia B and our recombinant single-chain factor VIII for hemophilia A will provide patients with novel treatment options that have the potential to give patients extended dosing intervals,  Perreault said.","Published: December 15, 2015"

( GRAM ) expands disposable technology capabilities at its FDA-approved manufacturing facility in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Over the past year, GRAM has added numerous capabilities to improve the overall service provided to clients, the latest of which is disposable technology. Disposable technology (also known as  Single-Use Systems (SUS) ) is one of the most important and valuable added capabilities due to its complementary benefits to both GRAM and the client. The benefit of disposable technology to the client is threefold: (1) cost savings; (2) time savings; and (3) improved safety and quality standards associated with SUS. As compared to the stainless steel system alternatives, process development timelines for disposable technology are greatly reduced. Additionally, there is greater flexibility in process design process which contributes to an overall lower capital cost. Also, by nature of being an SUS, client cross-contamination risks have been greatly mitigated. By utilizing disposable technology, GRAM is able to benefit from efficiency gains by reducing processing time, cleaning time, and prep time. Manufacturing downtime is also reduced due to the elimination of validation activities that come with the cleaning process. Eliminating the cleaning processes and validation activities also allows GRAM to realize costs savings associated with water-for-injection. Steve Nole, GRAM s Director of Manufacturing, stated,  We re excited to offer expanded disposable technology capabilities. This will enable us to respond more quickly to client needs and ultimately reduce their costs. ","Published: December 15, 2015"

The death of these cells initiates an autoimmune response against myelin, the main characteristic of the disease, which leads to MS-like symptoms in mice. This reaction can be prevented, however, through the application of specially developed nanoparticles, even after the loss of those brain cells. The nanoparticles are being developed for clinical trials that could lead to new treatments in humans. The study is published in Nature Neuroscience. ""Although this was a study in mice, we've shown for the first time one possible mechanism that can trigger MS the death of the cells responsible for generating myelin can lead to the activation of an autoimmune response against myelin,"" said study co-senior author Brian Popko, PhD, Jack Miller Professor of Neurological Disorders at the University of Chicago. ""Protecting these cells in susceptible individuals might help delay or prevent MS."" Multiple sclerosis involves an abnormal immune response against myelin, which leads to the progressive deterioration of a wide range of body functions. MS is thought to affect 2.5 million people worldwide, and has unclear causes and no known cure. To study how MS is triggered, Popko, with collaborator Stephen Miller, PhD, Judy Gugenheim Research Professor of Microbiology-Immunology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and their teams developed a genetically engineered mouse model that allowed them to target oligodendrocytes, the brain cells that produce myelin. By specifically killing oligodendrocytes, the team observed MS-like symptoms that affected the ability of the mice to walk. After this initial event, the central nervous systems of the mice regenerated their myelin-producing cells, enabling them to walk again. But about six months later, the MS-like symptoms came barreling back. ""To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that oligodendrocyte death can trigger myelin autoimmunity, initiating inflammation and tissue damage in the central nervous system during MS,"" said study co-author Maria Traka, PhD, research associate professor in neurology at the University of Chicago. Possible causes of oligodendrocyte death are developmental abnormalities, viruses, bacterial toxins or environmental pollutants. In humans, the researchers hypothesize MS could develop years after an initial injury to the brain triggers oligodendrocyte death. The mouse model also enabled the testing of new drugs against progressive MS. In the study, nanoparticles creating tolerance to the myelin antigen were administered and prevented progressive MS from developing. The nanoparticle technology was developed in Miller's lab and has been licensed to Cour Pharmaceutical Development Company, which is developing the technology for human trials in autoimmune disease. ""We're encouraged that the nanoparticles could stop disease progression in a model of chronic MS as efficiently as it can in progressive-remitting models of MS,"" Miller said. The timing of therapy is important, Popko pointed out. ""It's likely that therapeutic strategies that intervene early in the disease process will have greater impact,"" he said. The current prevailing theory is that an event outside of the nervous system triggers MS in susceptible individuals who may have a genetic predisposition to the disease. In these individuals, the immune cells that normally fight infections confuse a component of the myelin sheath as foreign. These confused immune cells enter the brain and begin their mistaken attack on myelin. But the new study demonstrates the possibility that MS can begin from the inside out, in which damage to oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system can trigger an immune response directly. Oligodendrocytes are responsible for the maintenance of myelin. If they die, the myelin sheath falls apart. The inside-out hypothesis suggests that when myelin falls apart, its components are presented to the immune system as foreign bodies or antigens. The immune system then erroneously views them as invaders and begins a full scale attack on myelin, initiating MS. ""It will be exciting to determine the nature of this process in humans its precise role in MS and whether therapies to prevent it are effective,"" Popko said.

The findings are published online in Molecular Systems Biology.  These findings identify common genomic defects that help explain why there are abnormal numbers of brain cells in autism, why the brain grows abnormally too large or too small in some toddlers with ASD and how previously reported diverse gene mutations may, in fact, converge in their effects via common genomic pathways,  said senior study author Eric Courchesne, PhD, professor of neurosciences and director of the Autism Center of Excellence at UC San Diego.  This study, along with the work of others and our past findings on excess neurons and brain growth patterns, enable researchers to now trace the origins of early abnormal brain overgrowth in ASD back to prenatal disruption of networks governing brain cell numbers.  The proper regulation of brain cell numbers is one of earliest critical steps in fetal brain development. Courchesne and colleagues first discovered in 2001 that early brain overgrowth occurs in a substantial subset of toddlers with ASD. In 2011, they reported that the young ASD prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with social and communications skills, exhibited a 67 percent excess in cortical cells. In 2014, they described patches of disrupted cortical development in the brains of children with ASD. Rare gene mutations capable of increasing or decreasing cell number and brain size have been reported for tiny percentages of all individuals with ASD, but for the vast majority of children with ASD, the genomic defects behind abnormal brain overgrowth or undergrowth have remained unknown. The new study points to a common underlying defective functional genomic network cell cycle in toddlers living with ASD, which plays a central role in fetal brain development. Courchesne noted that several hundred different genes coordinate the cell cycle network in the fetal brain.  When they are active in the right way at the right time, they generate the correct number and type of brain cells that go to the cortex to create the normal brain cell layers and connections,  he said.  Both genetic mutations and non-genetic factors can change how these genes work and cause abnormal cell numbers and cell types.  Attempts to better understand the genetic mechanisms underlying ASD are hindered by, among other things, the impossibility of direct brain gene expression measurement during critical periods of early development. However, first author Tiziano Pramparo, PhD, said blood and brain tissues highly express many of the same gene networks, particularly those related to cell cycle functions. Gene function in cell cycle networks regulating brain size is normal in typical toddlers (green), while it is abnormal in toddlers with ASD (blue, red) for both smaller and bigger brains. Bigger ASD brains are more severely affected than smaller brains. Credit: UC San Diego  In the current study, researchers investigated the relationships between blood gene expression and brain size in 142 male toddlers, ages 1 to 4 years, 87 with a diagnosis of ASD and 55 controls. In the control toddlers, researchers found that variation in brain size significantly correlated with cell cycle and protein folding gene networks, potentially impacting neuron number and synapse development. In toddlers with ASD, correlations with brain size were strikingly disrupted due to considerable changes in the organization of cell cycle gene networks. Conversely, cell adhesion gene networks, which regulate the ability of cells to stick together to form multicellular tissues and communicate, showed an abnormal relationship with variation in brain size in toddlers with ASD. They also identified 23 candidate genes for brain maldevelopment, of which 4 are directly linked to genes frequently mutated in ASD.  These patterns of activity in these 23 genes relative to brain size in the ASD toddlers was very different from that in typical toddlers,  observed Pramparo. Pramparo said the new findings provide in vivo evidence for the involvement of cell cycle processes in ASD brain maldevelopment and significantly illuminate the complexities involved in early dysregulation and disruption of the developing ASD brain. Specifically, he noted: Courchesne said the findings raise the possibility that future research could test whether genomic biomarkers of cell cycle disruption could be an early sign of ASD risk or might be indicators of clinical progression, severity and outcome.  Our next studies will examine whether infants at risk for ASD who have the most deviant cell cycle expression patterns also have more abnormal early development of brain structure, connections and function,  he said.  The findings do not directly suggest new therapies for children with ASD, but they raise the important question of whether the degree of genomic disruption might be related to treatment responsiveness.  Exploring this question, he said, along with how development of neural connectivity and functional patterns is altered in the brains of those with ASD, will be addressed in future research.

The condition can develop as part of age-related hearing loss or from a traumatic injury. In either case, the resulting persistent noise causes varying amounts of disruption to everyday life. While some tinnitus patients adapt to the condition, many others are forced to limit daily activities as a direct result of their symptoms. A new study reveals that people who are less bothered by their tinnitus use different brain regions when processing emotional information. ""We are trying to understand how the brain adapts to having tinnitus for a very long time,"" said Fatima Husain, University of Illinois speech and hearing science and neuroscience professor who conducted the research with kinesiology and community health professor Edward McAuley and neuroscience graduate students Jake Carpenter-Thompson and Sara Schmidt. Husain also is affiliated with the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology. Carpenter-Thompson is lead author on the paper, which is published in the journal PLOS ONE. Husain's research uses functional magnetic resonance imaging, an imaging tool that enables researchers to see changes in blood oxygen levels in the brain during an activity. Using fMRI, Husain's team previously compared how the brain processes emotion in patients with mild tinnitus and people without the condition. While in the scanner, study participants listened to and rated pleasant, unpleasant and neutral sounds (e.g. kids giggling, babies crying and people babbling in the background). The researchers reported that, in contrast to those without tinnitus, patients with mild tinnitus showed greater engagement of different areas in the brain when processing emotional sounds. To further understand this altered brain activation, Husain conducted a new fMRI study to see if there were any differences among tinnitus patients. Because some patients adjust to the ringing in the ears while others do not, the severity of the condition can vary greatly. Husain's team measured the severity of tinnitus, or tinnitus distress, with a series of surveys and questionnaires assessing hearing, attention, emotion and sleep. Patients with lower tinnitus distress used an altered pathway to process emotional information. The path did not rely on the amygdala, commonly believed to play an important role in emotion processing in the brain. Instead, patients who had adapted to their tinnitus symptoms used more of the brain's frontal lobe, a region critical for attention, planning and impulse control. The researchers suggested that the greater activation of the frontal lobe might be helping to control emotional responses and reduce tinnitus distress. Another aim of Husain's research was to evaluate possible interventions to help patients reduce tinnitus distress. The study reported that physical activity might influence emotion processing and help to improve quality of life of those bothered by tinnitus. Husain hopes more research will investigate this link. Her future research on the topic will also include active duty service members, a group highly affected by trauma-induced, early-onset tinnitus.

But in brain research, avalanches intermittent cascades of electrical activity are everyday occurrences that are not only peaceful, but actually reflect stability. For the first time ever in a study of the living human brain as it responds to outside stimuli, a doctoral candidate from Bar-Ilan University recently completed a quantitative analysis of how neuronal avalanches arise from the balance between two fundamental electrochemical forces mediated on the level of neural networks the force that excites the propagation of electrical activity through the brain, and the force that inhibits it. Using a non-invasive technique called magnetoencephalography (MEG), Oshrit Arviv compared the patterns of electromagnetic activity that occur in the resting brain, and those patterns generated by specific cognitive processes. Building on previous theoretical and experimental work on brain 'criticality' the state at which brain activity hovers between attenuation and amplification of electric signals by maintaining excitation-inhibition balance the new study is the first to demonstrate that neuronal avalanches can be triggered by high-level cognition. Arviv's novel computational approach also revealed that neuronal avalanche size and duration capture specific features of individual brain dynamics, demonstrating an analytic 'biometric' technique that links MEG-generated data to specific individuals. In a separate finding, the study demonstrates that stimulus-evoked avalanches the neural patterns evoked when various subjects perform a specific perceptual task share a high degree of similarity in terms of temporal and spatial distribution. This approach, which links specific cognitive tasks to the underlying neural network dynamics, represents an entirely new way to observe the human brain at work. These findings are published in the Journal of Neuroscience. The article was co-authored with the joint supervisors of Arviv's doctoral studies: Dr. Oren Shriki, Head of the Computational Psychiatry Lab at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, and Prof. Avi Goldstein of Bar-Ilan University's's Department of Psychology and Head of the Electromagnetic Brain Imaging Unit at the University's Gonda (Goldschmied) Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center. ""The billions of nerve cells in our brains are affected by opposing network-based forces, which either promote nerve-to-nerve communication, or inhibit it,"" says Arviv. ""The dynamic balance between these two functionalities is expressed, in part, by avalanches, naturally-occurring phenomena that re-set electrical activity and reflect stability in the brain. Somewhere in the space between 'too much' and 'too little' neural activity is criticality: the state in which brain function is most efficient."" According to Arviv, criticality is the state at which one synchronized group of neurons will activate, on average, only one other synchronized group, a limitation that optimizes the electrochemical activity that serves as 'fuel' for brain function. ""Scientists have long believed that the critical state optimizes the brain's ability to represent information,"" she says. ""Ours was the first experimental research to quantify the spatio-temporal organization of the critical branching process that produces neural avalanches, and compare this organization as it occurs in stimulus-evoked cognition, and in the resting state."" Arviv's experimental set-up used a visual task the processing of faces as a model system. Subjects were presented with 45 randomized pictures of mostly male faces, and were instructed to press a button when a female face appeared on the screen. While conducting the task, the subjects' brain activity was recorded with a whole-head magnetometer array, a MEG helmet. ""MEG is a technique based on direct reading of electromagnetic fields which allows the measurement of ongoing brain activity on a millisecond-by-millisecond basis, and can also show where in the brain such activity is produced,"" Arviv explains, adding that this ability to simultaneously gather a combination of excellent temporal data, together with good spatial data, gives MEG a distinct advantage over other methods. ""We observed a fluctuation in the opposing forces of excitation and inhibition which appeared in response to a specific cognitive behavior processing a face and which triggered avalanches. Not only were we able to plot exactly where these avalanches occurred in the brain, we could also follow avalanche propagation over time. No one has ever been able to identify the moment when the excitation-inhibition balance changes, certainly in terms of high cognition. Here, we achieved a high-resolution, temporal-spatial portrait of the brain at work."" In another aspect of the same study, Arviv compared avalanches produced during face processing tasks to those avalanches produced when the brain is in a resting state a state which was studied extensively by Dr. Oren Shriki at the National Institute of Mental Health, in Bethesda, Maryland. In her current research, Arviv identified a fascinating similarity between stimulus-evoked and resting-state avalanches as they occur within individual subjects -- indicating that each human brain may be possessed of a 'fingerprint', or unique pattern of avalanche dynamics. ""Our study showed that, for individual subjects, cortical activity, at both the resting state, and during stimulus-evoked activity, shared similar avalanche characteristics in terms of size and distribution, as well as temporal dynamics,"" she says. ""This means that you can potentially identify an individual mathematically, via the brain dynamics represented in the progression of their neural avalanches. This is interesting in terms of fundamental neuroscience, but also points toward the possibility that, sometime in the future, doctors might be able to identify changes in typical excitation-inhibition dynamics, and use it to diagnose neurological abnormalities or disease onset."" According to Arviv, computational avalanche analysis is a new and sophisticated way to characterize the high-level cognition that takes place within the human brain. ""There have been many EEG and fMRI studies that give indirect accounting of neural activity, and localize it to specific areas of the brain. But by using MEG technology, and by focusing on excitation-inhibition dynamics, our analyses reveal new information about how the human brain maintains its electrochemical stability, and processes perceptual stimuli,"" Arviv says, adding that in her current research, she is applying avalanche analysis to a study of epilepsy. ""This approach may shed light on mechanisms involved in maintaining healthy brain balance -- and help explain how neural criticality affects cognitive function in both healthy and pathological populations.""

Although commonly thought to be tied to the day-night cycle, the circadian clock actually appears to be set by metabolic rhythms, according to a new study by scientists from the University of Chicago. By genetically reengineering cyanobacteria to be able to feed on sugar, the team discovered that the cyanobacterial clock was unaffected by light or dark, but responded only to metabolism. The findings offer a glimpse into the evolutionary roots of the circadian clock and point to potential applications in synthetic biology. ""The question we are asking is how the circadian clock learns what time of day it is,"" said senior study author Michael Rust, PhD, assistant professor of molecular genetics and cell biology. ""In cyanobacteria, that answer seems to be especially simple -- the clock proteins sense the metabolic activity in the cell."" The circadian rhythm allows organisms to anticipate the regular environmental changes that occur during a 24-hour day and synchronize their biology accordingly. For humans, this manifests as preferred periods of time for sleep, eating or activity, which are linked to the day-night cycle. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, follow a similar pattern, engaging in photosynthesis and growth during day and ""rest"" and energy conservation at night. The biological mechanism that drives the circadian rhythm is known as the circadian clock. Cyanobacteria possess one of the simplest known circadian clocks -- the KaiABC system, a complex of proteins that undergoes a 24-hour biochemical cycle, which triggers oscillations in gene expression and physiological activity. This clock can be entrained, or ""set,"" when the bacteria are exposed to different periods of light and dark, similar to how human internal clocks adjust after long-distance travel. Despite this link, studies have found no evidence that the Kai system receives any information about light exposure. Instead, Kai proteins are sensitive to metabolic signals. To study the precise relationship between the circadian clock, light and metabolism, Rust and his colleagues created genetically engineered cyanobacteria that were able to feed on sugar in addition to normal photosynthesis. As these bacteria are able to survive in complete darkness just as well as light, the team could separately test the effects of metabolism and light. They began by comparing normal cyanobacteria to genetically altered ones. Under constant light exposure, both normal and altered cyanobacteria will maintain a regular circadian rhythm. Introducing periods of darkness easily resets the clocks of normal cyanobacteria.  However, darkness had no effect on the clocks of altered cyanobacteria, which had access to plentiful sugar. The team discovered that ATP and ADP -- two molecules that are central to metabolism and are known to modulate the Kai system -- were maintained in a steady ratio during darkness, suggesting that sugar feeding was responsible for stabilizing the clock. ""We found that the bacterial circadian clock responds only to metabolic activity,"" Rust said. ""If growth and metabolism are supported, the clock doesn't seem to care whether it's light or dark."" The team then tested the effects of sugar availability. They observed a regular circadian rhythm when they kept altered cyanobacteria in constant darkness, with a constant supply of sugar. However, when they removed sugar for periods of time, simulating a period of ""nighttime"" starvation, the bacterial circadian clocks would quickly reset. Different batches of cyanobacteria, on different feeding schedules, synchronized their clocks according to when they access to sugar. ""By looking at the molecular state of their clock, we found the bacteria tracked when we were feeding them and set their internal times to that schedule. They basically ""learned"" when the sugar was coming,"" Rust said. Cyanobacteria are one of the most ancient forms of life on Earth, and coupled with the universal nature of the circadian clock, this study indicates that its fundamental function is to help schedule different metabolic activities. Many microbes, such as human gut bacteria and some disease-causing bacteria, have genes similar to the cyanobacterial clock genes. But it is still unclear if they have a circadian rhythm. A better understanding of their circadian clocks and metabolism could possibly inform research efforts to promote healthy gut bacteria or neutralize harmful ones, Rust suggests. The discovery that the circadian clock is tied to metabolism and not light also raises numerous possibilities in synthetic biology. In previous experiments, Rust has demonstrated that Kai proteins isolated in test tubes are able to maintain their ability to function as a biological clock and respond to metabolic signals. Because its time-keeping function is independent of photosynthesis, efforts to install the Kai system into other microbes to carry out scheduled tasks become more promising. As for what better knowledge of circadian clocks could unlock in the distant future, Rust entertains a tantalizing possibility. ""In the historical development of electrical circuits, engineers found that synchronizing each step of a computation to an internal clock made increasingly complicated tasks possible, ultimately leading to the computers we all use today,"" he said. ""Perhaps in the future we'll be able to use synthetic clocks in engineered microbes in a similar way.""","Published: December 14, 2015"

The study was led by scientists from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg and the Spanish National Center for Genome Analysis (CNAG-CRG) in Barcelona. Oncologists are increasingly using information obtained from investigations of the tumor genome in order to find individualized therapies for patients. They specifically search the hereditary information of cancer cells for mutations that drive malignant growth. By now, targeted drugs against many of these cancer-typical cellular alterations have become available. However, how precisely and reliably do the numerous laboratories that specialize in this search around the globe identify individual cancer mutations? And how does the quality and type of sequencing influence results? A team of experts collaborating within the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) launched an interlaboratory test to find this out. They distributed the DNA of a tumor to five ICGC laboratories and compared the quality of the resulting sequencing data records. The data record that had the highest quality was subsequently sent out to another 17 ICGC institutes for bioinformatic evaluation. The investigators found significant variations both in sequencing and evaluation results in some of the cases. Only 40 percent out of one thousand small mutations, which each affected the exchange of only a single DNA base, were identified uniformly by all participating teams. The outcome for small DNA losses and insertions was even less favorable: Only a single one out of 337 of these genomic changes was identified by all of the centers. The team of experts led by Ivo Gut from the Spanish National Center for Genome Analysis* and Roland Eils from the German Cancer Research Center therefore devised measures to improve this situation. The DNA sequence from the circular experiment, which the participating ICGC labs have by now sequenced up to 300 times and analyzed with almost unprecedented precision, has now been made available for download. It serves as a kind of gold standard. Laboratories that start out in the field of genome analysis can use this data record as a basis to check whether the bioinformatic methods that they are using are capable of detecting all mutations concealed therein. In addition, the team developed evaluation guidelines that stipulate, among others, threshold values for detecting a particular mutation. ""Since tumor genome analysis is becoming increasingly common in cancer medicine, rigorous quality control is necessary   like in any other diagnostic method,"" says David Jones. ""After all, whether or not a patient survives may depend on the detection of a particular mutation that can be treated efficiently with a drug that is already available.

CRISPR is being called a game changer. It is a gene editing tool more precise, efficient and cheaper than its predecessors, and it is changing the way scientists and clinicians approach the treatment of genetic disorders.  CRISPR is the most important technology that I have encountered in my scientific career thus far. Working with patients and families with genetic disorders, I m often in a position where I can provide a diagnosis, and perhaps supportive care, but no treatment. CRISPR could change that. It could revolutionize the way we care for patients with currently untreatable genetic conditions,  says Dr. Ronald Cohn, principal investigator of the study, and Chief of Clinical and Metabolic Genetics and Co-director of the Centre for Genetic Medicine at SickKids. Although CRISPR has been widely used as a research tool, its potential in far-reaching therapeutic applications has largely been unexplored, explains Cohn. The study describes how researchers used cells obtained from a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) to put this technology to the test. Essentially they corrected the mutation that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. They used CRISPR like a pair of genetic scissors to not only remove the genetic duplication, but also to fully restore the gene s function. The result is that the dystrophin protein which is absent in DMD patients was completely restored to its full length, which could have significant impact on future therapeutic developments. Additionally, the study describes multiple applications of this technology as it relates to altering expression of genes or removing certain genetic material for therapeutic purposes. DMD is a life-limiting, progressive, neuromuscular disorder and currently the only treatment available are corticosteroids, which provide some improvement in muscle function but come with a number of significant side effects. The cells used in this study were from 14-year-old Gavriel Rosenfeld of the United Kingdom. He was diagnosed with DMD in 2007 when he was just four years old.  It was completely out of the blue. We had no history in our family, and I was not a carrier. We were told that Gavriel would be in a wheelchair by his early teens, would lose upper body function and would likely to die from cardiac or respiratory failure in his early 20s. There was nothing for us to do but give him steroids and physiotherapy. No parent can imagine being given this fatal diagnosis, let alone sitting back and doing nothing about it,  says Kerry Rosenfeld, Gavriel s mother. Today, Gavriel no longer walks and is quickly losing upper body function. He can still dress and feed himself but it s extremely hard for him as his friends become more independent while he is physically declining. This new research is a major step forward and is exciting not only for clinicians and scientists, but for families like Gavriel s who are anxiously waiting for a breakthrough and hoping the research moves quickly. The research is already moving faster than it has in the past because CRISPR has enabled such efficiency. It used to take up to 18 months to create a mouse model; now using CRISPR, it only takes four to five months! The mouse model will be used to study how we can edit the genome in a living organism. This study demonstrates the proof-of-principle that CRISPR can target disease-causing duplications in the genome. According to Cohn the next step is to re-create Gavriel s duplication in a mouse model in order to develop a therapy for this particular patient. This is precision, or individualized medicine in action, says Cohn. The biggest challenge however, will be to determine how to deliver the treatment and  edit  the genome in a living being.  As a clinician-scientist, to be able to help a child with more than just supportive care, and actually think about correcting the genetic mutation is truly paradigm shifting,  says Cohn. He adds that this paper lays the foundation for further research into the applications of these therapeutic strategies for safe and efficient treatments for many inherited diseases, not just DMD.","Published: December 14, 2015"

Through the natural process of evolution, DNA mutations generate new or more effective proteins. Humans have found so many alternative uses for these molecules   as foods, industrial enzymes, anti-cancer drugs   that scientists are eager to better understand how to engineer protein variants designed for specific uses. Now Stanford engineers have invented a technique to dramatically accelerate protein evolution for this purpose. This technology allows researchers to test millions of variants of a given protein, choose the best for some task and determine the DNA sequence that creates this variant. ""Evolution, the survival of the fittest, takes place over a span of thousands of years, but we can now direct proteins to evolve in hours or days,"" said Jennifer Cochran, an associate professor of bioengineering who co-authored the paper with Thomas Baer, executive director of the Stanford Photonics Research Center. ""This is a practical, versatile system with broad applications that researchers will find easy to use,"" Baer said. By combining Cochran's protein engineering know-how with Baer's expertise in laser-based instrumentation, the team created a tool that can test millions of protein variants in a matter of hours. ""The demonstrations are impressive and I look forward to seeing this technology more widely adopted,"" said Frances Arnold, a professor of chemical engineering at Caltech who was not affiliated with the study. Making a million mutants The researchers call their tool  SCALE, or Single Cell Analysis and Laser Extraction. The "" "" stands for the microcapillary glass slide that holds the protein samples. The slide is roughly the size and thickness of a penny, yet in that space a million capillary tubes are arrayed like straws, open on the top and bottom. The power of  SCALE is how it enables researchers to build upon current biochemical techniques to run a million protein experiments simultaneously, then extract and further analyze the most promising results. The researchers first employ a process termed ""mutagenesis"" to create random variations in a specific gene. These mutations are inserted into batches of yeast or bacterial cells, which express the altered gene and produce millions of random protein variants. A  SCALE user mixes millions of tiny opaque glass beads into a sample containing millions of yeast or bacteria and spreads the mixture on a microcapillary slide. Tiny amounts of fluid trickle into each tube, carrying individual cells. Surface tension traps the liquid and the cell in each capillary. The slide bearing these million yeast or bacteria, and the protein variants they produce, is inserted into the  SCALE device. A software-controlled microscope peers into each capillary and takes images of the biochemical reaction occurring therein. Once a  SCALE user identifies a capillary of interest, the researcher can direct the laser to extract the contents of that tube without disrupting its neighbors, using an ingenious method devised by Baer. ""The beads are what enable extraction,"" Baer said. ""The laser supplies energy to move the beads, which breaks the surface tension and releases the sample from the capillary."" Thus  SCALE empties the contents of a single capillary onto a collector plate, where the DNA of the isolated cell can be sequenced and the gene variant responsible for the protein of interest can be identified. ""One of the unique features of  SCALE is that it allows researchers to rapidly isolate a single desired cell from hundreds of thousands of other cells,"" said Bob Chen, a doctoral student in Cochran's lab who wrote the software to examine and detect signs of interesting protein activity within the test tubes. Promising variants can be collected and reprocessed through  SCALE to further evolve and optimize the protein. ""This is an exciting new tool to answer important questions about proteins,"" Cochran said, likening  SCALE to the way that high-throughput tools for gene analysis have allowed researchers to unlock key features of biology underlying human disease. Genesis and proofs The project began five years ago when Baer and collaborator Ivan Dimov developed the first instrument. They showed how to identify cell types in a microcapillary array and extract a single capillary's contents using glass beads and a focused laser. About three years ago, Cochran and Baer joined forces to develop  SCALE for protein engineering, and the team devised three experiments to showcase  SCALE's utility and flexibility. In one experiment, researchers sifted through a protein library produced in yeast cells to select antibodies that bound most tightly to a cancer target. Antibodies with a high target-binding affinity are known to be effective against cancer. In a second example, they engineered a bright orange fluorescent protein biosensor. Using  SCALE, they did this almost 10 times faster than previous methods. Such biosensors are often used as tags in a wide variety of biology experiments. A third experiment, carried out with Stanford biochemistry Professor Daniel Herschlag, used  SCALE to improve upon a model enzyme. ""This system will allow us to explore the evolutionary and functional relationships between enzymes, guiding the engineering of new enzymes that can carry out novel beneficial reactions,"" Herschlag said.","Published: December 14, 2015"

Lack of oxygen, or hypoxia, is often a sign that a cancer is growing aggressively. Hypoxia also stimulates the growth of blood vessels within tumours, which in turn can fuel the spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body. The new study could also lead to more effective radiotherapy planning to boost the doses of X-rays delivered to dangerous, hypoxic areas within tumours, and new ways of monitoring whether radiotherapy or some drugs are working. The study was funded by a range of organisations including Cancer Research UK, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and The Wellcome Trust. Researchers used an emerging technology called oxygen-enhanced MRI to produce maps of hypoxia within tumours grown by implanting cancer cells into mice. The technology is now being further developed through clinical studies of cancer patients. Oxygen-enhanced MRI works by monitoring alterations in image intensity caused by changes in the concentration of dissolved oxygen in blood plasma and tissue fluid, during inhalation of pure oxygen gas. Some tissues take up the extra oxygen more rapidly than others, which show as more intensely changing regions under the MRI scan. The researchers predicted that images of hypoxic tumour areas would change intensity less dramatically than better oxygenated areas. They followed a several-step process to prove their MRI technique worked at detecting areas of hypoxia, beginning with the imaging of tumours grown from a cell line of kidney cancer cells known to lead to highly hypoxic tumours. They then imaged a slower-growing kidney tumour type and tumours grown from a line of bowel cancer cells, to show their technique also worked for less hypoxic tumours. They cross-referenced their images against samples from the tumours viewed under the microscope to confirm their findings from the scans. Study co-leader Dr Simon Robinson, Team Leader in Magnetic Resonance at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said:  Our technique uses MRI technology to detect tumours with areas of oxygen depletion, which tend to be more aggressive and more resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Our study provides strong pre-clinical evidence to validate the use of oxygen-enhanced MRI to identify, quantify and map tumour hypoxia. Study co-leader Dr James O Connor, Group Leader at The University of Manchester, said:  There is currently no validated, affordable and widely available clinical imaging technique that can rapidly assess the distribution of tumour hypoxia. Our findings from studies in mice are already being translated for use on conventional clinical MRI scanners. Ultimately we hope that oxygen-enhanced MRI will not only to identify the most dangerous tumours, but to assist radiotherapy treatment planning and for monitoring treatment response.  Nell Barrie, senior science information manager at Cancer Research UK, said:  When cancer cells run out of oxygen, they re more likely to spread from the original tumour, making the disease much harder to treat. Spotting this process in action could help improve treatment, especially for more aggressive tumours, and this early-stage research in mice will help to find new ways to use existing scanning technology to monitor and personalise each patient s treatment. By combining different techniques such as imaging and radiotherapy, these promising results can be translated into benefits for patients in the years ahead. ","Published: December 14, 2015"

This study also provides insights into evolutionary distribution of different types of existing protein complexes. The Periodic Table of Protein Complexes offers a new way of looking at the enormous variety of structures that proteins can build in nature, which ones might be discovered next, and predicting how entirely novel structures could be engineered. Created by an interdisciplinary team led by researchers at the Wellcome Genome Campus and the University of Cambridge, the Table provides a valuable tool for research into evolution and protein engineering. Almost every biological process depends on proteins interacting and assembling into complexes in a specific way, and many diseases are associated with problems in complex assembly. The principles underpinning this organisation are not yet fully understood, but by defining the fundamental steps in the evolution of protein complexes, the new  periodic table  presents a systematic, ordered view on protein assembly, providing a visual tool for understanding biological function.  Evolution has given rise to a huge variety of protein complexes, and it can seem a bit chaotic. But if you break down the steps proteins take to become complexes, there are some basic rules that can explain almost all of the assemblies people have observed so far.  Dr Joe Marsh, formerly of the Wellcome Genome Campus and now of the MRC Human Genetics Unit at the University of Edinburgh. Different ballroom dances can be seen as an endless combination of a small number of basic steps. Similarly, the  dance  of protein complex assembly can be seen as endless variations on dimerization (one doubles, and becomes two), cyclisation (one forms a ring of three or more) and subunit addition (two different proteins bind to each other). Because these happen in a fairly predictable way, it s not as hard as you might think to predict how a novel protein would form.  We re bringing a lot of order into the messy world of protein complexes. Proteins can keep go through several iterations of these simple steps, adding more and more levels of complexity and resulting in a huge variety of structures. What we ve made is a classification based on these underlying principles that helps people get a handle on the complexity.  Dr Sebastian Ahnert of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge The exceptions to the rule are interesting in their own right, as are the subject of on-going studies.  By analysing the tens of thousands of protein complexes for which three-dimensional structures have already been experimentally determined, we could see repeating patterns in the assembly transitions that occur   and with new data from mass spectrometry we could start to see the bigger picture.""  Dr Joe Marsh  The core work for this study is in theoretical physics and computational biology, but it couldn t have been done without the mass spectrometry work by our colleagues at Oxford University. This is yet another excellent example of how extremely valuable interdisciplinary research can be.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/3d-map-of-the-human-genome-184491, D Map of the Human Genome  Whitehead Institute researchers have created a map of the DNA loops that comprise the three dimensional   D  structure of the human genome and regulate gene expression in human embryonic stem  ES  cells and adult cells   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The location of genes and regulatory elements within this chromosomal framework could help scientists better navigate their genomic research, establishing relationships between mutations and disease development.  This is transformational,  says Whitehead Member Richard Young.  This map allows us to predict how genes are regulated in normal cells, and how they are misregulated in disease, with far greater accuracy than before.  In order to regulate gene expression, a regulatory element needs to contact its target gene. Through looping, element/gene partners that are distant from each other in linear DNA can be brought together. Most disease mutations occur in regulatory elements, but if the partnership between a seemingly far-flung gene and the regulatory element is not known, the mutation data is of limited use. This draft map, which can help scientists predict the relationships between mutated elements and their target genes, is described online. When thinking about disease, we need to think about the structure of the genome in 3D space because that is how we now understand that genes are regulated,  says Xiong Ji, a postdoctoral researcher in the Young lab and a co-author of the  paper. One of Ji s co-authors, graduate student Daniel Dadon, agrees.  This three-dimensional information helps us to interpret regulatory and mutational data with unprecedented accuracy. It s not just a bag of genes and regulatory elements in the nucleus this is a highly organized structure that confers function.  Previous research in mouse ES cells by Young s lab and others determined that a chromosome s DNA is formed into loops that are anchored at their bases by proteins called CTCFs. The benefits of the loops are two-fold. First, the loops help organize and package two meters of DNA to fit into a nucleus that is approximately 5 micrometers in diameter. Second, each loop creates an insulated neighborhood that restricts the action of a regulatory element to genes that resides in the same loop.  As graduate student and co-author Diego Borges-Rivera states,  The genome s 3D shape is a key mechanism underlying gene regulation.  By studying human ES cells, scientists in the Young lab and the lab of Whitehead Founding Member Rudolf Jaenisch created an initial genome map consisting of 13,000 loops established by CTCF anchors and determined that the average insulated neighborhood is 200 kb in length and contains a single gene. The team found that most of the the mapped CTCF anchor sites in the human ES cells genome are maintained in other human cell types and furthermore, that these loop anchor sequences are highly conserved in primate genomes. Such a surprising degree of conservation indicates that these neighborhoods create a foundational framework for gene regulation that is maintained throughout development and across species. In a further finding that underscores the importance of the genome s 3D structure in human health, the Whitehead team found that the CTCF anchor regions are mutated in a broad spectrum of cancer cells.   The team predicts that these new maps of the human genome will provide the foundation for improved understanding of the genetic alterations that cause many additional diseases.","Published: December 14, 2015"

The bugs could also be used to monitor toxins in rivers or to improve crop fertilization. However, before such bacteria can be safely let loose, scientists will need to find a way to prevent them from escaping into the wider environment, where they might grow and cause harm. To this end, researchers at MIT, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and the Wyss Institute at Harvard University have developed safeguards in the form of two so-called  kill switches,  which can cause the synthetic bacteria to die without the presence of certain chemicals. In a recently published paper the researchers describe their two kill switches, which they call  Deadman  and  Passcode.  Stand-alone circuits There have been a number of attempts to develop kill switches over the past year, according to James Collins, the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science in MIT s Department of Biological Engineering and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES), who led the research. These include efforts to reprogram the entire genome of the organism to ensure that it requires the presence of certain amino acids or other chemicals in order to survive, divide, and grow. However, this approach can be both labor- and resource-intensive, and could introduce changes that might make the organism less useful as a monitoring or diagnostic tool, Collins says.  In our case, we are introducing standalone circuits that can be popped in to any number of different organisms, without needing to rewire or change much of the genome in order for it to accommodate the switch,  he says. The Deadman switch, for example, is part of a bacterial strain that needs an external chemical to prevent a continuously expressed toxin from killing the cell. The switch was motivated by the so-called deadman brakes on old trains, which required a conductor to be in constant contact with the handle or pedal in order for the vehicle to move forwards, Collins says. The system, which builds on previous work in Collin s lab, consists of a genetic  toggle  switch made up of two transcription factor genes. The switch can flip between two states, in which either one of the two transcription factor genes is turned on. The researchers altered the expression of these two transcription factors, leading to strong expression for one gene and weak expression for the other. The presence of a small molecule keeps the switch in its weak state, but as soon as this is removed, the switch will flip to its strong state. The switch is programmed to express various toxins as soon as this strong state is turned on, Collins says.  If the system does get flipped, by removing the small molecule, it would express toxins at a very high level that could then quite rapidly and readily kill off the bug,  he says. A cellular logic gate The Passcode switch, in contrast, acts like a logic gate in that it requires a specific combination of several chemical inputs in order to enable the genetically modified bacteria to survive and proliferate.   The switch consists of a set of modular transcription factors that contain separate domains for sensing small molecules   the inputs   and for regulating gene expression. By mixing and matching these functional domains, the researchers are able to construct hybrid transcription factors in which different small molecule inputs are linked to the control of a specific promoter for gene expression. If the transcription factors detect that the right combination of small molecules are present in the environment, then the bacteria will survive. But if the correct combination of input signals is not present, the switch kills the bug, according to the paper s lead author Clement Chan, a postdoc in Collin s laboratory.  If any of the required inputs are not correct, then the bug will die,  he says. By using different transcription factors, the researchers can change the passcode combination of small molecules needed for the cell to survive. In this way the switches can be easily changed to meet the needs of different applications, Chan says.  It makes our biocontainment system much more flexible, so you can apply the passcode system in a much wider range of applications.  The switches could also be used to protect a company s intellectual property, Chan says.  Imagine that you own a certain bug, and you don t want your competitors to use it. Then you could incorporate this device so that only people who know the passcode can use your bug,  he says. Even if a competitor somehow managed to get hold of the passcode, the researcher could simply change it by using different transcription factors, he says. Scaling up The new safeguards have exciting possibilities for scaling kill switches in two important directions, according to Farren Isaacs, an assistant professor in the Systems Biology Institute at Yale University, who was not involved in the research. First, they establish the feasibility of using kill switches across diverse species, Isaacs says.  They also expand the passcode switches to a large combination of synthetic molecules and transcription factors for many unique sets of biocontained strains and customized cocktails of synthetic small molecules,  he adds. Having successfully tested the two kill switches in Escherichia coli, the researchers are now hoping to incorporate them into living diagnostic or therapeutic tools, designed to target a variety of bacterial infections, Collins says.","Published: December 14, 2015"

As head of the Molecular Machines group at the MIT Media Lab, Jacobson s work has focused on, among other things, developing technologies for the rapid fabrication of DNA molecules. In 2009, he spun out some of his work into Gen9, which aims to boost synthetic-biology innovation by offering scientists more cost-effective tools and resources. Headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Gen9 has developed a method for synthesizing DNA on silicon chips, which significantly cuts costs and accelerates the creation and testing of genes. Commercially available since 2013, the platform is now being used by dozens of scientists and commercial firms worldwide. Synthetic biologists synthesize genes by combining strands of DNA. These new genes can be inserted into microorganisms such as yeast and bacteria. Using this approach, scientists can tinker with the cells  metabolic pathways, enabling the microbes to perform new functions, including testing new antibodies, sensing chemicals in an environment, or creating biofuels. But conventional gene-synthesizing methods can be time-consuming and costly. Chemical-based processes, for instance, cost roughly 20 cents per base pair   DNA s key building block   and produce one strand of DNA at a time. This adds up in time and money when synthesizing genes comprising 100,000 base pairs. Gen9 s chip-based DNA, however, drops the price to roughly 2 cents per base pair, Jacobson says. Additionally, hundreds of thousands of base pairs can be tested and compiled in parallel, as opposed to testing and compiling each pair individually through conventional methods. This means faster testing and development of new pathways   which usually takes many years   for applications such as advanced therapeutics, and more effective enzymes for detergents, food processing, and biofuels, Jacobson says.  If you can build thousands of pathways on a chip in parallel, and can test them all at once, you get to a working metabolic pathway much faster,  he says. Over the years, Jacobson and Gen9 have earned many awards and honors. In November, Jacobson was also inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for co-inventing E Ink, the electronic ink used for Amazon s Kindle e-reader display. Scaling gene synthesizing Throughout the early-and mid-2000s, a few important pieces of research came together to allow for the scaling up of gene synthesis, which ultimately led to Gen9. First, Jacobson and his students Chris Emig and Brian Chow began developing chips with thousands of  spots,  which each contained about 100 million copies of a different DNA sequence. Then, Jacobson and another student, David Kong, created a process that used a certain enzyme as a catalyst to assemble those small DNA fragments into larger DNA strands inside microfluidics devices    which was the first microfluidics assembly of DNA ever,  Jacobson says. Despite the novelty, however, the process still wasn t entirely cost effective. On average, it produced a 99 percent yield, meaning that about 1 percent of the base pairs didn t match when constructing larger strands. That s not so bad for making genes with 100 base pairs.  But if you want to make something that s 10,000 or 100,000 bases long, that s no good anymore,  Jacobson says. Around 2004, Jacobson and then-postdoc Peter Carr, along with several other students, found a way to drastically increase yields by taking a cue from a natural error-correcting protein, Mut-S, which recognizes mismatches in DNA base pairing that occur when two DNA strands form a double helix. For synthetic DNA, the protein can detect and extract mismatches arising in base pairs synthesized on the chip, improving yields. In a paper published that year in Nucleic Acids Research, the researchers wrote that this process reduces the frequency of errors, from one in every 100 base pairs to around one in every 10,000. With these innovations, Jacobson launched Gen9 with two co-founders: George Church of Harvard University, who was also working on synthesizing DNA on microchips, and Drew Endy of Stanford University, a world leader in synthetic-biology innovations. Together with employees, they created a platform called BioFab and several other tools for synthetic biologists. Today, clients use an online portal to order gene sequences. Then Gen9 designs and fabricates those sequences on chips and delivers them to customers. Recently, the startup updated the portal to allow drag-and-drop capabilities and options for editing and storing gene sequences.   This allows users to  make these very extensive libraries that have been inaccessible previously,  Jacobson says. Fueling big ideas Many published studies have already used Gen9 s tools, several of which are posted to the startup s website. Notable ones, Jacobson says, include designing proteins for therapeutics. In those cases, the researcher needs to make 10 million or 100 million versions of a protein, each comprising maybe 50,000 pieces of DNA, to see which ones work best. Instead of making and testing DNA sequences one at a time with conventional methods, Gen9 lets researchers test hundreds of thousands of sequences at once on a chip. This should increase chances of finding the right protein, more quickly.  If you just have one shot you re very unlikely to hit the target,  Jacobson says.  If you have thousands or tens of thousands of shots on a goal, you have a much better chance of success.  Currently, all the world s synthetic-biology methods produce only about 300 million bases per year. About 10 of the chips Gen9 uses to make DNA can hold the same amount of content, Jacobson says. In principle, he says, the platform used to make Gen9 s chips   based on collaboration with manufacturing firm Agilent   could produce enough chips to cover about 200 billion bases. This is about the equivalent capacity of GenBank, an open-access database of DNA bases and gene sequences that has been constantly updated since the 1980s. Such technology could soon be worth a pretty penny: According to a study published in November by MarketsandMarkets, a major marketing research firm, the market for synthesizing short DNA strands is expected to reach roughly $1.9 billion by 2020. Still, Gen9 is pushing to drop costs for synthesis to under 1 cent per base pair, Jacobson says. Additionally, for the past few years, the startup has hosted an annual G-Prize Competition, which awards 1 million base pairs of DNA to researchers with creative synthetic-biology ideas. That s a prize worth roughly $100,000. The aim, Jacobson says, is to remove cost barriers for synthetic biologists to boost innovation.  People have lots of ideas but are unable to try out those ideas because of cost,  he says.  This encourages people to think about bigger and bigger ideas. ","Published: December 14, 2015"

The study was a close collaboration between the Millar laboratory; the laboratory of Nobel Laureate Kurt W thrich, Cecil H. and Ida M. Green Professor of Structural Biology at TSRI; and the laboratory of Raymond C. Stevens, formerly of TSRI and now Provost Professor of Biological Sciences and Chemistry and director of The Bridge Institute at the University of Southern California (USC). Crucial to Disease The researchers focused on the beta-2 adrenergic receptor ( 2AR), a protein that sits on the cell membrane, where it binds external molecules and sends signals to the inside of the cell.  2AR belongs to a class of proteins called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). There are more than 800 known human GPCRs, and they are linked to conditions from heart disease to Parkinson s disease and Huntington s.  2AR is known to play a role in asthma, obesity and type 2 diabetes. In fact, GPCRs are so crucial to disease that more than 35 percent of pharmaceuticals target these receptors. In previous studies, scientists used a method called x-ray crystallography to catch  snapshots  of  2AR in its active and inactive forms. Although the static images provided insight into the protein s structure, the scientists couldn t show how frequently the receptor activated or how different drug molecules governed the time spent in each state.  We wanted to go in-depth and look at the dynamics of this receptor in molecular detail using state-of-the-art single-molecule techniques,  said Rajan Lamichhane, research associate at TSRI and co-first author of the new study with Jeffrey J. Liu of the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry (formerly of TSRI). Surprise Findings In the new study, the scientists incorporated  2AR in  nanodiscs,  small particles that mimic the native cell membrane but contain only a single receptor molecule. They tagged a section of the receptor with a fluorescent probe and monitored the fluorescence intensity over time in a sophisticated microscope system. The probe lit up when the receptor was inactive and went dim when active, giving the researchers a way to track activation in real time. The researchers tested  2AR's reactions to formoterol, an anti-asthma drug known as an  agonist,  or activator, of  2AR signaling, and to the drug ICI 118,551, an inverse agonist known to suppress signaling. The probe s flickering revealed several crucial details about  2AR. First, the researchers found that the receptor naturally fluctuates between its active and inactive states in the absence of any drug a phenomenon scientists had always suspected but had not been able to prove directly. Tracking the behavior of individual receptor molecules revealed these fluctuations for the first time and established how long the receptor stays in each state. Second, the presence of formoterol doesn t just activate  2AR faster it also stops  2AR from deactivating as quickly.  That was a surprise,  said Millar, describing formoterol s  twin  functions. The researchers also saw that ICI 118,551 caused  2AR to deactivate more rapidly. Together, the findings explain why  2AR exhibits some signaling activity even in the absence of any drug molecules and why different drugs can either stimulate or inhibit signaling. With the new single-molecule fluorescence technology in hand, the researchers said the next step is to find molecules that spark the same behavior as formoterol and ICI 118,551 perhaps molecules that could work on different GPCRs to affect different diseases.","Published: December 14, 2015"

Dongyan Zhang, a research professor of physics at Michigan Tech, led the experiments, which covered tests on carbon nanotubes, graphene, boron nitride nanotubes, boron nitride nanosheets and zinc oxide nanowires. Those are used in everything from carbon fiber golf clubs to sunscreen.  These materials are very, very tiny, and that means if you try to remove them and clean them out of contaminated water, that it s quite difficult,  Zhang says, adding that techniques like filter paper or meshes often don t work. What makes shaking work is the shape of one- and two-dimensional nanomaterials. As the oil and water separate after some rigorous shaking, the wires, tubes and sheets settle at the bottom of the oil, just above the water. The oils trap them. However, zero-dimensional nanomaterials, such as nanospheres do not get trapped. Green Nanotechnology We don t have to wait until the final vote is in on whether nanomaterials have a positive or negative impact on people s health and environmental health. With the simplicity of this technique, and how prolific nanomaterials are becoming, removing nanomaterials makes sense. Also, finding ways to effectively remove nanomaterials sooner rather than later could improve the technology s market potential.  Ideally for a new technology to be successfully implemented, it needs to be shown that the technology does not cause adverse effects to the environment,  Yap, Zhang and their co-authors write.  Therefore, unless the potential risks of introducing nanomaterials into the environment are properly addressed, it will hinder the industrialization of products incorporating nanotechnology.  Purifying water and greening nanotechnology could be as simple as shaking a vial of water and oil.","Published: December 14, 2015"

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/novel-approach-to-understanding-brain-function-203835,Novel Approach to Understanding Brain Function Russell Poldrack scanned his brain to create the most detailed map of brain connectivity ever   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In the process, he and his colleagues revealed strong correlations between brain function and gene expression, and how the brain reorganizes itself when running low on caffeine. Every Tuesday and Thursday morning for a year and a half, Russell Poldrack started off his day by climbing into an MRI machine and scanning his brain for 10 minutes. The self-experimentation has made the Stanford psychologist's brain the most studied in the world. Professor Poldrack, who began the work at the University of Texas and has continued it at Stanford, committed himself to the long-term study in order to expand the understanding of how different parts of the brain talk to each other, an organization known as the connectome, and how that behavior changes over time. To bolster the results, Poldrack also fasted and drew blood on Tuesdays, which was analyzed to draw connections between brain function and gene expression. This step also showed definitive   and surprising   evidence of just how the brain reorganizes itself when it's low on coffee. Mapping brain communication In any action that a person undertakes, many different regions of the brain communicate with each other, serving as a sort of check-and-balance system to make sure that the correct actions are taken to deal with the situation at hand. These messages are communicated over more than a dozen networks, sets of functional areas of the brain that preferentially talk to one another. There are multiple networks for vision, a somatosensory/motor network, and there are others that are attributed to attention or task management. Collectively, these are known as the connectome. Because the strength or efficiency of these individual networks can affect behavior, they have become of greater interest to researchers in recent years. To isolate these connections, researchers examine functional MRI data collected while the patient (including Poldrack) is at rest. ""I would get in the MRI and basically close my eyes and zone out while it took a picture of my brain every second for 10 minutes,"" he said. ""Once we had that data, we could get ideas of which regions of my brain are talking to each other by how correlated they are over time. This tells us how much connectivity there is within each network."" Previously produced connectome maps have consisted of snapshots of individual brains, averaged together to identify general networks between different functional areas of the brain. Poldrack was interested in learning if these connections hold up for the same person over months. Do they change depending on mood or other environmental influencers? And, if the connections do change, how much would his connectome look like someone else's? Would his activity on a ""sad"" day look like that of a depressed person's? Poldrack's connectivity was surprisingly consistent, but it did show some changes over the course of the 18 months which have never before been observed. While this result raises many new questions, the robust consistency showed that the long-term approach has promise for revealing differences between healthy brains and those of patients with neurological disorders that might suffer from disrupted connectivity, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.  The coffee effect An obvious piggyback experiment to an 18-month-long study is to examine changes in gene expression. On Tuesdays, Poldrack fasted and gave a blood sample after his scanning session. The RNA from his white blood cells was sequenced to determine his gene expression, which was then compared to his brain function. The researchers found a strong correlation between brain activity and changes in the expression of many different families of genes. They also found that expression of genes related to inflammation and immune response matched Poldrack's psoriasis flare-ups. Because the data set is so massive, there are still many questions to ask, which is why Poldrack is making all of the data publicly available.  Fasting for the blood draw also revealed a surprising bonus result: ""Easily the biggest factor we found in terms of affecting my brain connectivity was whether I had had breakfast and caffeine or not,"" Poldrack said. On Tuesdays, when he hadn't drunk his morning joe before the scan, the connectivity within his brain looked very different from his caffeinated brain. Anecdotally, this makes sense. But such an influence had never been observed before. In particular, the connection between the somatosensory motor network and the systems responsible for higher vision grew significantly tighter without caffeine. ""That was totally unexpected, but it shows that being caffeinated radically changes the connectivity of your brain,"" Poldrack said. ""We don't really know if it's better or worse, but it's interesting that these are relatively low-level areas. It may well be that I'm more fatigued on those days, and that drives the brain into this state that's focused on integrating those basic processes more."" The signal and the noise The results are evidence that long-term analysis is a useful tool, Poldrack said, and hopefully make it attractive to a larger population of subjects. In many ways he was an ideal subject   he was available, committed to the long haul, and could sit still in the scanner   but diversity will ultimately lead to more interesting discoveries. ""I'm generally a pretty happy and even-keeled person,"" he said. ""My positive mood is almost always high, and my negative mood is almost always non-existent. It would be interesting to scan people with a wider emotional variation and see how their connections look over time."" In the meantime, Poldrack and his colleagues have made the entire data set and the ready-built tools to analyze it available through this site: http://myconnectome.org/wp/data-sharing. The data set is so large and deep, Poldrack said, that he hopes people will approach it from innovative angles and uncover connections that will help advance the research. Poldrack, meanwhile, plans to hone software to elucidate the interplay between brain function and gene expression. ""It's a hard data set to know what to do with, because it's hard to tell if something is noise or if it's real with just one person. But there's potentially some really interesting stuff here,"" he said. ""There are a ton of relationships between brain connectivity and gene expression in the blood, that are clearly there and seem to be strong, but we just don't have a way to understand them based on current neuroscience.""","Published: December 14, 2015"

The collaboration provides for the research, development, and commercialization of antibody-based cancer therapeutics against two novel Compugen-discovered immune checkpoint regulators, CGEN-15001T and CGEN-15022. The milestone payment being announced today, and the two previous milestone payments received by Compugen under the collaboration, all relate to CGEN-15001T, which is the more advanced of the two programs. This program, for which US and EU patents have been granted to Compugen, is demonstrating encouraging functional activity in preclinical models of cancer immunotherapy. Upon achievement of this third milestone, this program has now been transferred to Bayer s full control for further preclinical and clinical development activities, and worldwide commercialization, under milestone and royalty bearing licenses from Compugen. CGEN-15022, which is at an earlier stage than CGEN-15001T, continues under the joint preclinical research program, with results from these activities providing promising support for the target s ability to modulate immune response via a potentially novel mechanism of action, and the target is currently being further characterized regarding its role in anti-cancer immune response.  We are very pleased to have reached this milestone, which marks the successful completion of the joint pre-clinical work for one of the two immuno-oncology candidates under the Bayer/Compugen collaboration. Now that this program is transferred to Bayer for further preclinical and clinical development, we view this as further testimony to the power of drug discovery via computational predictions,  said Anat Cohen-Dayag, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Compugen. Cohen-Dayag continued,  Since the very beginning of this partnership, there has been continuing progress on both programs, including a growing understanding of target biology, in addition to the advancement of therapeutic candidates in a joint preclinical research program. Each program presents a distinctive differentiation profile compared to known checkpoints, providing potentially different mechanisms of action and expanded opportunities for cancer treatment. Both partners are excited by the potential of the two programs as they progress towards potential novel therapeutics for cancer immunotherapy. ","Published: December 12, 2015"

To date, the gold standard for diagnosis of psychosis has been clinical observation, classifying patients into schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and bipolar disorders. But in this study, the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) identified three neurobiologically distinct biotypes that do not always match up with the conventional clinical diagnosis. An estimated 6 percent of the U.S. population experience schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or bipolar disorders. That s as many as 19 million Americans.  In a sense, we have totally deconstructed and rethought the basis for diagnosis in psychosis,  said Dr. Carol Tamminga, Chair of Psychiatry at the UT Southwestern, who leads the consortium.  Building diagnoses based on biology, not just phenomenology, makes it possible for the biological bases of these brain disorders to stand out as molecular targets for disease definition and novel treatments.  The B-SNIP consortium, which also includes Harvard University, Yale University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Georgia, published its findings online in the American Journal of Psychiatry.  In the end, we found the term  psychosis  might actually describe a number of unique psychiatric disorders, just as the term  congestive heart failure  might describe a range of cardiac, renal, and pulmonary disorders, each having distinctive mechanisms and treated with specific remedies,  said Dr. Elena Ivleva, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and the study co-leader at UT Southwestern. Considerable evidence has shown that a symptom-based diagnosis of psychotic illness incompletely captures biologically meaningful differentiations, often resulting in less-than-satisfactory treatments. In the study, participants submitted to various cognitive, eye-tracking movement, and electroencephalography (EEG) tests as well as several modalities of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The group included psychotic individuals, their first-degree relatives, and a control group of subjects. Analysis of the results of the biomarker battery in 1,872 of those tested demonstrated three distinct clusters, or biotypes, of psychoses:  Biotype 1 was the most impaired group, demonstrating poor cognition and eye-tracking capabilities, and the most brain tissue damage, primarily distributed over frontal, temporal and parietal regions of the brain. Although all of the usual psychosis diagnoses appear in Biotype 1, there was a slight predominance (59 percent) of schizophrenia cases in this most impaired biotype, and they tended to have more severe psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) than the other groups.  Biotype 2 demonstrated cognitive impairment and poor eye-tracking, but exhibited high brain wave response as measured by EEG, something neuroscientists often call  noisy brain.  These individuals are often rated as over stimulated, hyperactive, or hypersensitive. Biotype 2 also had gray matter loss in frontal and temporal regions, but less than that found in Biotype 1. Biotype 2 cases also had worse scores on mood scales, such as depression and mania.  Biotype 3 was the least impaired, with near-normal evaluations of cognition, EEG function, and brain structure. Their symptoms were of moderate severity. Subjects in this group were slightly more likely to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder (60 percent).  What s puzzling and fascinating at the same time is that all three biologically driven disease constructs, or biotypes, might be clinically diagnosed as having schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or bipolar disorder,  said Dr. Tamminga, who holds the Lou and Ellen McGinley Distinguished Chair in Psychiatric Research, and the Communities Foundation of Texas, Inc. Chair in Brain Science.  There are multiple examples in other fields of medicine where use of biomarkers has led to a distinction of unique diseases that overlap in their symptom presentations,  said Dr. Tamminga.  Hopefully, this neurobiological examination of severe mental illness will lead to more precise, biologically meaningful diagnoses and novel treatments.  Dr. John Sweeney, Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry and Pediatrics at UT Southwestern, was a Co-Principal Investigator. Dr. Sweeney holds the Townsend Distinguished Chair in Research on Autism Spectrum Disorders. B-SNIP was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, (NIMH) and is part of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative, which aims to develop the fundamental data for basing psychiatric diagnoses on biological characteristics, instead of merely on clinical symptoms. The goal is to develop a framework for modeling mechanisms of brain diseases. UT Southwestern recently established the Peter O Donnell Jr. Brain Institute, a comprehensive initiative dedicated to better understanding the basic molecular workings of the brain and applying these discoveries to the prevention and treatment of brain diseases and injuries.","Published: December 12, 2015"

Dr. Mendell, a scientist known for his work on the role of noncoding RNAs in cancer and tissue regeneration, will be honored Jan. 21, 2016, during TAMEST s annual conference in Dallas. TAMEST presents four Edith and Peter O Donnell Awards each year   in medicine, science, engineering, and technological innovation   to recognize Texas researchers whose work exemplifies excellence in advancing understanding of important unmet needs. Each award consists of a $25,000 honorarium, a citation, a trophy, and an invitation to speak at the conference. The 2016 honors mark the 10th anniversary of the O Donnell awards program.  It is a fantastic honor to receive this award from the O Donnell family and TAMEST. The members of TAMEST are role models for all scientists in Texas, and it is especially meaningful to receive recognition from this illustrious group,  said Dr. Mendell, who is also a member of UT Southwestern s Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine. In 2009, Dr. Mendell published a study in Cell that found suppressed levels of one noncoding RNA called microRNA 26a (miR-26a) in a mouse model of liver cancer. Based on this result, his research team hypothesized that microRNA replacement therapy might represent a novel treatment strategy. They found, remarkably, that delivery of miR-26a to mice dramatically inhibited cancer progression and killed liver cancer cells without harming nearby healthy cells and tissue. More recently, Dr. Mendell s laboratory team showed similar results in a mouse model of intestinal cancer and, in yet another study, reported that microRNAs are important in wound healing. MicroRNAs serve as brakes that help regulate how much of a protein is made, which, in turn, determines how cells respond to various stimuli.  These promising proof-of-concept results helped set the stage for delivery of microRNA-based therapies for cancer and other diseases that are now being tested in clinical trials,  Dr. Mendell said.  Dr. Mendell s groundbreaking investigations are accelerating discoveries of new therapeutic strategies that have the potential to eradicate tumors without harming nearby tissue,  said Dr. Daniel K. Podolsky, President of UT Southwestern. Dr. Eric Olson, Chair of Molecular Biology and Director of the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine, described Dr. Mendell as a trailblazer.  Josh Mendell is highly deserving of this award for his pioneering work on the functions of noncoding RNAs in cancer and tissue regeneration. In addition to their fundamental scientific importance, his discoveries open many new therapeutic opportunities,  said Dr. Olson, who holds the Pogue Distinguished Chair in Research on Cardiac Birth Defects, the Robert A. Welch Distinguished Chair in Science, and the Annie and Willie Nelson Professorship in Stem Cell Research. Dr. Mendell said the award would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of members of his laboratory, both past and present, as well as his amazing UT Southwestern colleagues. In particular, Dr. Olson and other members of the Department of Molecular Biology have created an environment that fosters truly outstanding science, he added. Dr. Mendell earned his undergraduate degree in biology from Cornell University and later completed an M.D. and Ph.D. in human genetics from the medical scientist training program at Johns Hopkins University. He joined the Johns Hopkins faculty, then came to UT Southwestern in 2011. That same year, Dr. Mendell was named a Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas Scholar in Cancer Research. The Edith and Peter O Donnell Awards are named in honor of the O Donnells, who are among the state s staunchest advocates for excellence in scientific advancement and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education.  The O Donnell awards, which annually highlight some of the most promising investigators in Texas, could not have been possible without the exceptional vision of Edith and Peter O Donnell, who also have been dedicated, generous supporters of UT Southwestern for many years,  said Dr. Podolsky, who holds the Philip O Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Presidential Chair in Academic Administration, and the Doris and Bryan Wildenthal Distinguished Chair in Medical Science.","Published: December 12, 2015"

A team of researchers from Harvard, Cornell and Binghamton University, which included Mark F. Lenzenweger, distinguished professor of psychology at Binghamton University, recruited ten women with BPD from the New York Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical College and conducted this neuroimaging study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods.

UC Davis geneticists David Neale and Charles Langley worked with the California Walnut Board to develop genetic markers for use with classical walnut breeding. The first step was to sequence the walnut genome, which, unlike most major agricultural crops, had never been sequenced. This represents the first reference genome sequence for a nut crop. UC Davis has the only walnut breeding program in California. The Walnut Improvement Program, under the direction of plant breeder Chuck Leslie, cooperates with a large number of research partners to develop new walnut varieties. Walnuts a top export crop for California The walnut variety Chandler was used for the sequencing project because it is the leading variety of walnut in California. It is grown on about 50 percent of California s walnut acreage and accounts for more than 70 percent of the trees sold for new plantings. California produces 99 percent of U.S. commercial walnuts, and walnuts are the state s fourth largest agricultural export. Consumer demand for nuts is growing, and nutritionists are touting the health attributes of moderate nut consumption in lowering the risk for heart disease. Walnuts are high in omega-3 fatty acids, a healthy form of fatty acids, and can be part of a heart-healthy diet by lowering low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol levels in blood. Growers are also striving to produce nuts more sustainably, particularly in the areas of pest management and drought tolerance. Genomics adds to traditional breeding Commercial walnut trees are grafted onto rootstocks, usually a California native black walnut species or a hybrid, known to better withstand diseases, pests and abiotic stress. For the scion, or nut-bearing portion of the tree, an English walnut species is usually used, and breeders are interested in yield, nut quality, harvest date and meeting consumer preferences. Having the genome sequence of the walnut should accelerate its rate of breeding and variety improvement. Dan Kluepfel, a USDA research plant pathologist in the UC Davis Department of Plant Pathology, is heading a project to breed for walnut rootstock disease resistance. The information will help breeders select for desired traits such as insect and disease resistance and drought tolerance. In addition to the completed genome sequencing of the Chandler walnut variety, Neale and Langley are sequencing the walnut rootstock species. This composite information will provide additional genomic resources that can be combined with traditional breeding techniques to develop new walnut varieties. Chandler walnuts, for example, are harvested late in the season, and growers would like earlier harvests. Marker-assisted breeding provides an opportunity to develop early harvesting cultivars with the desirable attributes of Chandler.  The large repository of walnut genetic material at UC Davis along with new genomic resources lay the groundwork for future breeding of more-sustainable walnut varieties that meet the growing demand for walnuts,  said Neale. UC Davis and the California Walnut Board, which funded the project, have made the walnut genome sequencing information publicly available at the further information link below.","Published: December 11, 2015"

A new study from UC Berkeley illustrates the ease with which CRISPR-Cas9 can knock out genes in exotic animals   in this case, an amphipod or sandhopper   to learn how those genes control growth and development. Researchers wanted to know which genes control the development of appendages on each segment of the amphipod, whose body is like a Swiss army knife with each segment bearing a different blade or tool as an appendage. In less time than it would have taken two years ago to knock out one gene in the animal, UC Berkeley researchers knocked out six, shedding light on the basic genetic mechanisms that determine leg anatomy in the evolution of animals.  By knocking out, one by one, the so-called Hox genes that specify body parts in all animals, they switched the identities of the crustacean s limbs, transforming a claw into a leg, for example, or a jaw into an antenna.  For those of us studying non-traditional model organisms in the lab, this has the flavor of a technical revolution,  said UC Berkeley postdoctoral researcher Arnaud Martin.  CRISPR-Cas9 definitely changes the range of possibilities in working with exotic animals, and the amphipod is one of the first.  The Hox family of genes Martin is investigating is found in all animals, and some biologists argue that an animal can be defined as any creature having Hox genes. They are known to turn on or off a myriad of genes in each segment of the body. Humans  body segments are most evident in the spine, where each type of spinal vertebra is unique in shape, all under the control of Hox genes. In the tropical marine amphipod Parhyale hawaiensis, Martin and Patel wanted to know which of the Hox genes function in each of its 19 segments to produce mouthparts at the front, then claws, followed by forward-moving legs, powerful jumping legs that propel the crustacean backwards, swimming legs and finally stumpy  anchor  legs.  CRISPR-Cas9 has made a huge impact already in model systems, like the fruit fly Drosophila and the nematode C. elegans, where there are already a lot of tools. People were able to incorporate the technology very quickly and change the way they make mutants in those animals,  said senior author Nipam Patel, a UC Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology and of integrative biology.  But there are a lot of other animals we want to work with because we can use them to answer really basic evolutionary questions. CRISPR-Cas9 is a great technology for that.  Other researchers have recently used CRISPR-Cas9 to edit genes in unusual organisms like the sea anemone, the lamprey and butterfly to see whether the tool works, but for the most part these have been  proof-of-principle  experiments using CRISPR-Cas9 to confirm what was already known.  Here we have gone way beyond just showing that it works in Parhyale and jumped right into answering a really important developmental and evolutionary question: how you set up all of these limbs in the crustacean, and how evolution changes that pattern of limbs by altering Hox gene expression patterns,  Patel said. Master regulatory genes The Hox complex is a cluster of genes, often referred to as master regulatory genes, that code for protein transcription factors that turn off or on lots of other genes. Starting early in development, they come on in different combinations in different segments of the body, from head to tail. Since they first appeared in our animal ancestors 600 million years ago, evolution has worked with this same complex of genes to produce a huge variety of animal shapes. Amphipods are ideal animals in which to study these genes because each segment has a specific type of leg selected by nine different Hox genes, Martin said.  They are limbs in the broad sense   really appendages,  he said.  Some have a sensory function   the antennae. Other ones have a prehensile feeding function, like the claws of the lobster. Other appendages have a locomotory function   the legs   or things that are more paddle-shaped for swimming. These differences within an animal are all defined by Hox expression.  To investigate the function of six of these Hox genes, the researchers employed a hammer approach: use CRISPR-Cas9 enzymes to break and disable one of the six genes in each amphipod embryo, so that the entire organism lacked that one gene alone. They were then able to identify which genes control which appendage.  In one of the most spectacular transformations, we took the feathery swimming legs located at the front of the abdomen and, by removing one gene, transformed them into what looks exactly like the a large jumping leg normally found on the last thoracic segment,  Patel said.  In another experiment, we basically show exactly how you make an isopod from an amphipod: you move one gene called  abdominal-A  out of the thorax, and this will make all the walking legs similar and pointing all in the same direction.  Patel noted that in real evolution, genes are not usually broken or eliminated but tweaked, their expression turned on or off in different segments to get different effects.  Without first taking away the gene to see the gross effect, we can t even begin to guess what the role of just moving around the expression would be,  Patel said.  We can now come up with a code that specifies what kind of limb develops given the combination of Hox genes being expressed there, and we are carrying out new experiments to further test this code.

Multiple myeloma is a cancer that forms from white blood cells that are found in the bone marrow and are normally vital to a healthy immune system. Natural killer (NK) cells are white blood cells that roam through the blood stream, attacking infections and potentially cancer-causing cells. The technology to grow NK cells from umbilical cord blood was developed by Nina Shah, M.D., assistant professor and Elizabeth J. Shpall, M.D., professor in the department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.   Results from the clinical study, led by Shah and Shpall, were presented  at the 57th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual conference in Orlando, Fla.  Multiple myeloma is an incurable disease thought to be characterized by immune dysregulation and exhaustion, whereby proliferation of malignant plasma cells is not checked by the immune system,  said Shah.  Long-term remissions in some patients after stem cell transplants from donors have been observed, but treatment-related toxicity limits the widespread use of this therapy.  Shah and Shpall s team enrolled symptomatic patients who qualified as candidates for high-dose chemotherapy drugs like melphalan, and transplantation of the patient s own stem cells.  Successful natural killer cell expansion to target dose was achieved in all the patients,  said Shah.  The cell therapy infusion resulted in no toxicity and no occurrences of graft-versus-host disease.  Graft-versus-host disease is a condition in which the patient s immune system is attacked by the donor stem cells. The disease can occur in patients who have received donor stem cells or immune.   Twelve patients were enrolled in the study and were divided into four separate groups, with each receiving different dose levels of cord blood-derived natural killer cells. Ten of the 12 patients demonstrated high-risk disease or relapse in disease prior to study participation.","Published: December 11, 2015"

The team used cutting-edge cryo electron microscopy from the Electron Imaging Center for Nanomachines, led by Dr Hong Zhou, at UCLA s California NanoSystems Institute. With this technology they demonstrated how the virus enters cells to initiate infection via a two-stage process, and how the different molecular components fit together. This new understanding will enable researchers to develop new vaccines with broader protection against BTV and related viruses.  Viruses establishing infection in host cells is a highly coordinated process. The molecular and chemical details are relatively clear for enveloped viruses, such as influenza, HIV and herpes, but up to now the mechanisms for cell entry of non-enveloped viruses, such as BTV and others, had not been well understood.  The researchers discovered that the virus has sensor proteins on its surface that detect changes in the acidity of its environment.  When these proteins sense higher acidity caused by proximity to the target cell,  the virus unfurls a protein structure that penetrates the outer membrane of the cell and anchors the virus to the cell, causing infection. The team confirmed this mechanism by lowering the acidity around the virus, which caused the membrane-penetrating protein structure to detach and refold, showing its status in high and low pH environments.  Over the past decade Professor Roy has undertaken the first complete molecular understanding of BTV. This includes its replication cycle from virus entry via genome replication to virus assembly and structure, cell-to-cell transmission, and the engagement of the virus particle with the host cell.  Professor Roy said:  We are delighted with these results, which show the virus in the highest possible detail at different pH levels. This represents a key piece in the puzzle and a significant step forward for understanding molecular structures and mechanisms in this family of viruses. We hope it will enable the design of specific anti-viral agents and new and efficient vaccines for the control of bluetongue and related viral infections of animals and humans .  This work also has promising implications for understanding similar human and animal pathogenic viruses, such as rotaviruses and the Rift Valley fever virus.

The study reflects a breakthrough approach using advanced computational designs to identify new factors that can be targeted to prevent viruses from spreading. The research team also created a website with open access for scientists to cull additional host-targets to develop the next-generation of anti-influenza drugs. ""Traditionally, physicians have treated the flu with drugs that directly block the influenza virus,"" said Sumit Chanda, Ph.D., co-senior author and director of the Immunity and Pathogenesis Program at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute (SBP). ""Although these drugs have been helpful, many patients fail to respond because viruses, especially influenza A virus (IAV), can mutate, rendering them resistant to available drugs. Our research efforts are focused on finding unalterable host molecules -- the ones within our bodies -- that viruses hijack to spread and create full blown infections."" Influenza viruses cannot replicate on their own. They can only carry a few genes -- about a dozen or so -- compared to a human genome comprising more than 20,000 genes. To ensure their survival, flu viruses rely on co-opting molecular machines in the infected host, which they use to their advantage to grow and spread. In recent years, researchers have sought to turn the tables and fight viruses by blocking their access to host molecules. By integrating multiple IAV host-pathogen 'Omics' databases, including one generated by the work in this study, the research team identified 20 previously unrecognized host proteins required for IAV replication. One protein, UBR4, was singled out as a pivotal host protein that the virus uses to bud off from the host cell membrane and form spherical vesicles that transmit the virus within and between individuals. The study showed that blocking UBR4 in human cells (in vitro) and mice (in vivo) reduced IAV replication and pathogenesis, establishing proof-of-concept of the strategy to target UBR4 as an influenza treatment. ""Our work illustrates how the computational analysis of large datasets from multiple independent studies can reveal novel host factors and networks involved in virus replication as potential targets for therapeutic intervention,"" said Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, Ph.D., director of the Global Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. ""'Big data' is no longer merely a catchphrase -- it is a real tool to help scientists address the world's most serious public health threats.""

""Recent waves of new technologies have allowed scientists to generate unprecedented quantities of data about human disease. But now, there exists an equally large gap between those that are producing and analyzing these data, and those that apply the data for therapeutic benefit.

The method could be used to estimate time of death in different seasons, as well determine the original location of moved corpses and help locate buried corpses.  We feel there is great promise that our findings could be used by forensic scientists,  said Jessica Metcalf, PhD, staff research associate at UC San Diego School of Medicine and CU-Boulder.  We view it as a potential method that could be used with other lines of evidence by investigators attempting to solve suspicious crimes.  Metcalf led the study with Rob Knight, PhD, professor of pediatrics, and computer science and engineering at UC San Diego. Each human harbors up to an estimated 100 trillion microbes   as many as 10 times the number of human cells in the body   that undertake functions ranging from food digestion to strengthening the immune system. The team used a powerful gene-sequencing technique to chart microbes present on cadavers and associated soils immediately following death.  Advances in genetic sequencing technologies now allow us to find patterns in large, diverse populations of microorganisms, see how they associate with specific individuals, and understand how they change over time   in a way we couldn t just a few years ago,  said Knight, who leads the UC San Diego Microbiome and Microbial Sciences Initiative.  This study extends the techniques we developed to use the microbiome to predict disease while a person is alive, and shows the microbiome can also provide useful information after death.  Knight was also part of a group of U.S. scientists who co-authored a recent Science paper calling for a nationwide Unified Microbiome Initiative. The study developed its data using the Sam Houston State University s Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science Facility, a 26-acre outdoor human decomposition research lab. The facility, the largest of its kind in the world, uses donated cadavers that allow students, law enforcement officials and scientists to study bodies in various decomposition stages, aiding them in forensic science situations. In addition to examining human cadavers, the team studied the decomposition of mice on three different soil types: desert, short-grass prairie and high alpine forest. Surprisingly, the  decomposer  microbial communities under mice were similar in all three soils, all undergoing predictable succession similar to that which occurs beneath the human cadavers. For both mouse and human cadavers, skin and soil microbes provided good accuracy in predicting time of death, with roughly a two-to-four day error estimate over a span of 25 days, said Knight. The team also demonstrated that bodies decomposing on soils modify the soil microbial communities substantially, allowing detection of a decomposing human body via the soil microbial community, even if a body has been moved. The accuracy of these changes in microbial communities after death is on a par with a current and popular forensic tool: blowflies. These insects are attracted to vertebrate corpses, where they lay eggs that develop as larvae in known time increments. But unlike the blowfly method   which is of limited use by forensic scientists due to cold seasons and corpse accessibility   the new technique has no such constraints, Metcalf said. That s because all humans are toting a particular suite of bacteria that stand at the ready for the end of life.  The invisible living systems we all carry around are already seeded with decomposition microbes,  Metcalf said.","Published: December 11, 2015"

DNA methylation is one such mechanism of epigenetic gene expression control that can be passed down to future generations.

Dr Laura Gardiner, from the University's Centre for Genomic Research, said: ""Due to the sheer size of the wheat genome, undertaking a survey like this has been technically unworkable until now, but understanding how and when genes are activated is a key part of understanding its complexity. ""This work opens up a whole new level of genetic variation which can be exploited by wheat breeders. In the future we see epigenetic marks becoming an important new tool in this area.""Using a combination of sodium bisulphate treatment and targeted gene enrichment, the team observed that methylation is highly conserved across all three genomes of hexaploid wheat, but found evidence of sub-genome specific methylation. Methylation changes were also found to be associated with changes in gene-expression and, although not demonstrated, these changes are likely to affect the phenotype. The stability of methylation in the wheat genome was also shown, with some methylation patterns conserved for over 0.5 million years. Liverpool scientists created the first draft of the wheat genome in 2012, enabling new levels of precision breeding for this globally important food source which provides 20% of daily calories and protein for the world's population. Professor Anthony Hall, who led the study, added: ""With the ability to characterise genome-wide patterns of methylation we can now address fundamental questions in wheat, such as the role of epigenetics in the domestication of crops and the stability and long-term function of methylation.

Sometimes they re sprinters, sometimes hurdlers. But they generally find their genetic targets, whatever the obstacles. A new theoretical study by Rice University scientists looks at the roles of those obstacles, and how they hinder   and sometimes help   proteins in finding their targets along strands of DNA. In doing so, Rice biophysicist Anatoly Kolomeisky and his team said they are helping to resolve seeming conflicts between other studies on how proteins carry out their biological tasks. The authors, including Rice postdoctoral researcher Alexey Shvets and graduate student Maria Kochugaeva, set out to see how proteins actively seeking a target deal with blocking proteins. In computer simulations, they established cases where the obstacle is static on DNA, a hurdle to be overcome, and others where the obstacle is dynamic, repeatedly landing on and disassociating from the strand.  Most previous theories assume there s only DNA and the protein, but there s no obstruction between the protein and its target,  Kolomeisky said.  In reality, there are obstructions, and a lot of them. Cells are very crowded systems. The surprising thing is that a protein still manages to find its target sequence efficiently. But how?  We decided to look at these things because the literature has theoretical studies with contrary results,  he said.  One says obstacles are good; another says obstacles are bad. What we re saying in unifying them is that, yes, sometimes they re good and sometimes bad. People were looking at specific regimes or parameters and thinking theirs was a general case.  The Rice researchers attacked the challenge in stages. In their simplest simulation, the seeker protein is a sprinter, alighting on DNA and probing for its target, usually finding it in milliseconds. If the target is on the other side of an obstacle, the seeker becomes a hurdler: It eventually disassociates and continues searching. But if it falls within a segment shortened by an obstacle, the seeker finds it faster.  This was a surprise, that the presence of the obstacle is not always a bad thing,  Kolomeisky said.  But in reality, obstacles are not static,  he said.  Taking things step by step, we went to the next, where obstacles bind and unbind to the same place on DNA.  Even in these more-complex models, seeker proteins found benefits, he said.  Dynamic obstacles are generally better than static because sometimes they go away.  Kolomeisky said the fundamental paper should be of interest to anyone who studies gene transcription, signaling pathways or drug design.  This process of proteins finding a target on DNA is the beginning of all biological processes,  he said.  Activating a gene means a protein binds somewhere on DNA and starts a cascade. If they don t do it well, you might have a problem   so it s important to understand how and why the process works.  Kolomeisky said the study serves as a baseline for the lab, which will now turn its attention to a more complex scenario in which obstacles can also sprint along DNA, like a moving hurdle.","Published: December 11, 2015"

This can also reduce the development of drug resistance and the broader toxicity often associated with this type of chemotherapy. The findings were made with laboratory animals, and just published in the Journal of Controlled Release by researchers from the College of Pharmacy at Oregon State University. The work was supported by an  OSU startup fund, and a provisional patent has been granted for this technology.  Melanoma can be a very difficult cancer to treat because it often metastasizes and travels through the lymphatic system,  said Adam Alani, an assistant professor in the Oregon State University/Oregon Health & Science University College of Pharmacy, and lead author on this research.  Melanoma has a high mortality rate because the lymph nodes tend to act as a haven for cancer cells, and allow them to resist treatment through chemotherapy,  he said. The new OSU research, however, was able to combine three anti-cancer drugs at the same time into a nanoparticle delivery system. After injection, these nanoparticles primarily migrated to lymph nodes, acted in a synergistic manner that was more powerful than any one drug could be separately, and were able to maximize their impact in those locations while minimizing the development of drug resistance and overall toxicity. Laboratory mice treated with this approach all survived. The therapy caused no apparent negative effects, and at least one type of the nanoparticles migrated effectively to distant lymph nodes, where the drugs significantly reduced the number of melanoma cells. More research with animals, experiments with more aggressive forms of cancer, and eventually human clinical trials will still be needed for any treatment is available for use. This could become an important advance in the treatment of any type of cancer that tends to move through the lymphatic system, Alani said. This includes melanoma, but also breast, head and neck, prostate, pancreatic, lung and gastric cancers. Up to 80 percent of melanomas metastasize through the lymphatic system, the researchers said in their report, and the tumor cells even secrete growth factors to further streamline their progress. The enlarged lymphatic vessels  act as a freeway for the metastatic cells to gain access and spread to distal lymph nodes and organs,  they wrote in the study. The major drawback of existing therapies, they said, is the inability to deliver therapeutic concentrations of drugs to the lymphatic system without creating systemic toxicity. Use of drugs one at a time also tends to breed resistance to them.

Dr Asif Zia, together with Professor Subhas Mukhopadhyay, both from the School Engineering and Advanced Technology developed an electrochemical sensing system that is able to rapidly quantify a synthetic compound   di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate or DEHP for short. DEHP is used to induce flexibility in the plastic products but, because of its molecular structure, it does not attach itself covalently to the plastic s lattice structure and may leach into the surrounding environment. It is classed as a teratogenic, or malformation causing, compound as well as an endocrine-disrupter, which interferes with the body s natural hormonal system. The World Health Organization refers concentrations of DEHP greater than six parts per billion as hazardous for human health. Dr Zia s tiny 2.5 mm by 2.5 mm sensor is able to be swirled through a liquid and detect concentration levels as low as two parts per billion, using a test that takes less than 10 minutes. The sensor is coated with a molecular imprinted polymer   essentially a type of chemical Velcro which selectively catches only DEHP molecules in liquids. The molecules  stick  by forming weak hydrogen bonds with the coating. After the sensor is rinsed, they pass electromagnetic fields through it (spectroscopy) to deduce the concentration of DEHP present. Dr Zia says the technology is groundbreaking because it is simple to use, sensitive enough to detect small amounts of the compound and robust as the coating owns a shelf life of years without degrading and can be regenerated and reused. Most of all, it is fast.  Previous technology required taking a sample to the lab, where they would first have to separate the molecule in question and then test it via flame ionization detection, mass spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography. This could take up to a week. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the test procedures takes only a few minutes.  They hope the sensor can be integrated into a tap in what is called a  smart home . The home would be fitted throughout with sensing equipment and computational power, allowing the occupant to get information on their health and wellbeing on demand. Plastic contamination is a global issue Illegitimate addition of DEHP as clouding agent in beverages has been a controversial issue in Taiwan in 2011. The country faced huge economic loss, where it had to recall all the exported beverages for testing. The testing lasted months due to the unavailability of a reliable, rapid testing system as well as the enormous testing cost involved. However, Dr Zia says the issue of contaminants leaching from plastic is global.  Plastic is a way of life, it s hard to get around that. Every day we could be ingesting tiny amounts of these compounds which, over time, can build up in the body and cause problems. Some countries, like the United States for example, have already banned DEHP s use in plastics but for others who have not, this device provides a simple and cost-effective way to make sure there aren t harmful levels of contamination in juices or other drinks  The research group is now working on developing a biological version of the sensor that would detect collagen in blood samples. High collagen levels in the blood may indicate early signs of osteoporosis. The project was done in collaboration with the Instrument Technology Research Center, Taiwan and the sensor was fabricated by the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia.","Published: December 11, 2015"

The study will look at the safety and tolerability of PnuBioVax for three different dosages compared to placebo. Each dose will be given as a prime and two boosts in male and female adults, in a double blind procedure. Conducted by Simbec Research Ltd at its site in Glamorgan, Wales, the study expects to enrol 36 volunteers, with results anticipated in Q2 2016. The primary endpoints of the study are safety and tolerability, as well as selected immunological markers of response. As a measure of secondary outcomes, a range of immunological assays will investigate the likely impact of the vaccine on asymptomatic carriage of the pathogen, and generation of key antibodies, including PnuBioVax s ability to neutralise pneumolysin, a toxin produced by S. pneumoniae. S. pneumoniae commonly resides asymptomatically in the nasal passages of healthy people. However, in susceptible individuals, such as the elderly, young children and the immunocompromised, it can propagate to the blood and vital organs, leading to life threatening diseases including meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia, endocarditis and pericarditis. Despite the availability of antibiotics, the death rate associated with pneumococcal disease, once invasive infection has occurred, is around 14%, making early preventative treatment vital. There are over 90 serotypes of S. pneumoniae in circulation, and individual antibodies against the bacteria provide serotype-specific protection, making vaccine development challenging. Currently marketed vaccines are relatively expensive to produce and only target a limited number of serotypes each and, by their design, cannot cover emerging strains or serotype replacement. ImmBioVax uses a novel process, incorporating heat shock proteins (HSPs). These proteins are produced by cells in response to stress, for example, heat, and are known to activate both the adaptive and innate arms of the immune response. The PnuBioVax vaccine contains HSPs and multiple antigens produced by a modified form of S. pneumoniae, leading to a mechanism of action which is expected to be strain-independent. Consequently PnuBioVax has the potential of being protective across a broad range of current and emergent serotypes, in contrast to currently-available products. In addition, the manufacturing process has a high yield and low production costs, with the potential of being more readily affordable.  Preclinical studies of PnuBioVax4 have found its immune response to be serotype-independent, and we expect this to be reflected in the upcoming clinical trial.  said Dr Chris Bailey, Development Director at ImmBio. He continued:  We will be investigating multiple immunological outcomes based on T-cell and functional antibody responses.  Graham Clarke, CEO of ImmBio, commented:  ImmBio aspires to create a universal vaccine for the huge unmet need of pneumococcal disease. Whilst this has proved elusive to date, we are encouraged that the unique multi-protein design of PnuBioVax offers a viable way to achieve this. Progression of PnuBioVax into First-in-Human studies provides validation of our progress in preclinical studies and manufacturing, and takes us a step closer to a potentially more effective and affordable vaccine for this life threatening disease.  ImmBio s commercial strategy is to develop its vaccine candidates through to proof-of-concept in man, and to find partners to progress late stage development, manufacturing and marketing.","Published: December 11, 2015"

Despite a detailed knowledge of the action of LSD at specific serotonin receptors, it has not been understood how this these pharmacological effects can translate into such a profound effect on consciousness. A new report presented December 10th at the annual meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology in Hollywood, Florida, provides evidence to show that LSD reduces connectivity within brain networks, or the extent to which nerve cells or neurons within a network fire in synchrony. LSD also seems to reduce the extent to which separate brain networks remain distinct in their patterns or synchronization of firing. Overall, LSD interferes with the patterns of activation in the different brain networks that underlie human thought and behavior. In this new study, Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris and his colleagues at Imperial College London did sequential brain scans of 20 healthy volunteers over 6 hours, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which maps brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), a technique that images brain function by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring in the brain. Using fMRI, the investigators showed that LSD led to a more chaotic brain state not entirely dissimilar to what is seen in the prodromal phase of psychosis. Specifically, neurons that were supposed to fire together within a network fell out of synchrony, while networks that are normally distinct started to overlap in their connectivity patterns. Dr. Carhart-Harris also found increases in blood flow in the visual cortex at the back of the brain, which might explain the visual hallucinations and distortions so common in LSD intoxication. MEG also showed a change in natural brain oscillations, specifically a decrease in alpha waves across the brain. The MEG changes were highly correlated with visual hallucinations, suggesting that under the influence of LSD, the visual system is tethered more to the internal than to the external world. Dr. Carhart-Harris suggests that ""with better assessment tools available today than in the 1950's and 1960's, it may be possible to evaluate potential uses of LSD as a treatment for addiction and other disorders, such as treatment-resistant depression - which we are currently investigating with a similar drug to LSD"". LSD also may provide a useful human model of psychosis, as it leads to changes in brain network behavior that shows overlap with the early phase of psychosis.

According to a report presented Dec. 10th at the annual meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, in Hollywood, Florida, sensation seeking is related to reward sensitivity, which is a trait that characterizes how rewarding a person finds different experiences. Further, reward sensitivity is itself related to cannabis use, and partially explains the relationship between it and sensation seeking. Importantly, the researchers describe a school-based psychological intervention that both targets sensation seeking and affects the use of cannabis in teens, delaying the onset of first use, and slowing the progression from light to heavy cannabis use in teens already using. In a very large sample of nearly 4000 adolescents, Dr. Patricia Conrod and her colleagues at the University of Montreal and Le Centre hospitalier universitaire Sainte-Justine evaluated reward sensitivity over time. The degree of reward sensitivity was determined using a laboratory ""go-no go"" task, in which individuals are instructed as to when to act and when not to act, in order to obtain reward or avoid punishment. The investigators found that reward sensitivity develops differently in boys and girls and is related to whether sensation seeking is high or low. More details about this and related studies can be found online at co-venture.ca, which describes the Co-Venture Trial, in which personality-targeted interventions are evaluated for their impact on 5-year addiction outcomes and cognitive functioning. Dr. Conrod's study suggests that psychological interventions aimed at helping youth manage sensation seeking and reward sensitivity may help reduce cannabis use. This may be particularly timely, given that teens perceive cannabis use as being low risk, even in the face of increasing evidence that cannabis use can negatively affect the developing brain and its cognitive functions.

Previous experiments with animals had already shown that substances from the same chemical group as the apigenin, known as flavonoids, positively affect memory and learning. Many studies highlight the potential of flavonoids to preserve and enhance brain function. While the effectiveness of flavonoids for brain health is not an entirely new concept, this research is the first to show the positive effects of apigegin directly on human cells and the first to unraveling its mechanism. The scientists observed that just by applying apigenin to human stem cells in a dish they become neurons after 25 days an effect they would not see without the substance. Moreover, the neurons that were formed made stronger and sophisticated connections among themselves after being treated with this natural compound. ""Strong connections between neurons are crucial for good brain function, memory consolidation and learning"", says neuroscientist from IDOR and UFRJ Stevens Rehen, leader author of the paper published today at Advances in Regenerative Biology. The research team conducted by Rehen demonstrated that apigenin works by binding to estrogen receptors, which affect the development, maturation, function, and plasticity of the nervous system. This group of hormones is known to delay the onset of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. However, the use of estrogen-based therapies is limited by the increased risk of estrogen-dependent tumors and cardiovascular problems. Researchers believe apigenin can be used as an alternative approach on future treatments for neurodegenerative diseases as well as in neuronal differentiation strategies in laboratory. ""We show a new path for new studies with this substance"", points out Rehen.

Inhibited sexual desire, known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder, affects premenopausal women, but no biological cause is known. In people, it can make physical intimacy difficult or impossible. David Abbott, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology in the UW School of Medicine and Public Health, and Alexander Converse, associate scientist at UW-Madison's Waisman Center, studied the effects of flibanserin in the common marmoset, a monkey for which pair bonding is instrumental to mating success and family life. In a new study now online in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, Abbott and Converse linked flibanserin-initiated decreases in female metabolism in the parts of the brain associated with executive function with increased pair bonding. Although both males and females in the study initiated more grooming, the behavior was more pronounced in the males, even though only females received the drug. The researchers say that despite the increased intimate attention inspired by the drug, there is much room for improvement with flibanserin and related drugs. For example, it works in only about 10 percent of patients, according to FDA data. And unlike Viagra, where one pill does the trick, flibanserin, sold under the brand name Addyi, must be taken over time to have an effect. Side effects can be serious and include severely low blood pressure and potential loss of consciousness. Alcohol consumption, certain medicines and liver impairment can exacerbate the risks. ""More research is needed on the underlying mechanisms of how this new drug works, so that the treatment and safety can be improved,"" Abbott says. To begin to explore the mechanism of action, Abbott and Converse compared flibanserin-treated monkeys to untreated monkeys using noninvasive PET scanning on live common marmosets at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center. Marmosets and humans have similar hormonal signaling activity and mating behaviors, especially in response to sexual cues such as touch and scent. ""The female marmosets in our study provided effective, unparalleled, controlled models, allowing us to determine how flibanserin acts in the primate brain,"" Abbott explains. After mapping the animals' brains with MRI scans, Converse used PET imaging to correlate changes in brain chemistry, particularly the use of glucose at specific locations with flibanserin-induced behavioral changes. Together with colleague Yves Aubert, Converse and Abbott found that glucose metabolism declined in the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus, a brain center long linked to intimate grooming and solicitation of sex in both marmosets and rodents. The amount of metabolic decline correlated directly with an increase in grooming by a male partner. In short, the bigger the metabolic dip in brain activity, the more grooming. ""Metabolism in the prefrontal cortex, a brain area involved in assessing events and deciding on actions, was also reduced in females receiving flibanserin,"" Abbott notes. ""The amount of decline predicted increased mutual grooming."" The research by the Wisconsin group was funded by the pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim, which developed flibanserin until 2011 when Sprout Pharmaceuticals took over development of the drug. Sprout earned FDA approval for the drug earlier this year. Although the female marmosets did not have hypoactive sexual desire disorder, Abbott says the study nonetheless shows that flibanserin, by altering metabolic brain activity, prompts increased female behavior responses to grooming, a form of intimate, gentle touching from males. That, says Abbott, ""offers the first insight into how the drug may be working in the brains of women."" University of Wisconsin-Madison   Original reporting by: Jordana Lenon Converse AK et al.

In addition to the huge hit to your wallet, there's also the potential harm of false positives, and just because a test has traditionally been done for a condition doesn't mean it's the best way to treat it. University of Michigan (U-M) Health System neurologist Brian Callaghan, MD, MS, is helping lead a national push to determine what neurologic tests or services are performed more than they should be. It comes out of a campaign called Choosing Wisely, an initiative of the ABIM Foundation, which works with more than 70 medical specialty societies to encourage conversations between clinicians and patients about avoiding wasteful or unnecessary medical tests, treatments and procedures. Each society, including the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), got together to identify an initial list of five medical services that may be unnecessary. Many societies have returned with second, or even third, lists of five. Callaghan's neurology group started by looking into the AAN's list, and then went further to identify a whopping 74 items to look into from other recommendations that addressed neurological care, such as from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the American Academy of Neurological Surgeons. Many were duplicates, which might indicate a consensus of areas to focus on. ""The two biggest areas that might be done more than they should are imaging for low back pain and imaging for headaches,"" Callaghan said. ""It's a big problem and it costs a lot of money - we're talking a billion dollars a year on just headache imaging."" The other test/treatment appearing most often was opioids, or pain medications. The diseases/symptoms that appear most often are Callaghan and his colleagues aren't encouraging you to say no if your doctor wants to image your low back pain or headache, but instead, they hope to inspire more thought and discussion about the specific purpose of a test. ""Ordering an MRI for a headache is very quick, and it actually takes longer to describe to the patient why that's not the best route,"" Callaghan said. ""These guidelines are meant for physicians and patients both, to trigger a conversation."" The next step is to get the doctor-patient discussions going, so Callaghan's group is now researching how to make it easier for physicians to follow the guidelines. ""These are all areas where lots of physicians agree that you're more likely to get harmed by doing the procedures,"" Callaghan said. The team also came up with areas that need more recommendations, including movement disorders, neuromuscular disease, epilepsy and multiple sclerosis.

Patients who receive a cancer diagnosis often develop debilitating symptoms of anxiety and depression. Reports from the 1960s and 1970s suggest that hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD may alleviate such symptoms in cancer patients, but the clinical value of hallucinogenic drugs for the treatment of mood disturbances in cancer patients remains unclear. In this new study, Roland Griffiths and colleagues from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine investigated the effects of psilocybin on symptoms of anxiety and depression in individuals diagnosed with life-threatening cancer. Five weeks after receiving a dose of psilocybin sufficiently high to induce changes in perception and mystical-type experiences, patients reported significantly lower levels of anxiety and depression compared with patients that received a low dose of the drug. The positive effects on mood persisted in the patients at 6 month follow-up. The authors suggest that a single dose of psilocybin may be sufficient to produce enduring decreases in negative mood in patients with a life-threatening cancer.

Scientists have found hundreds of genes that are mutated in patients with disorders such as autism, but each patient usually has only a handful of these variations. To further complicate matters, some of these genes contribute to more than one disorder. One such gene, known as Shank3, has been linked to both autism and schizophrenia. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) neuroscientists have now shed some light on how a single gene can play a role in more than one disease. In the study that appears in Neuron, they revealed that two different mutations of the Shank3 gene produce some distinct molecular and behavioral effects in mice. ""This study gives a glimpse into the mechanism by which different mutations within the same gene can cause distinct defects in the brain, and may help to explain how they may contribute to different disorders,"" says Guoping Feng, the James W. and Patricia Poitras Professor of Neuroscience at MIT, a member of MIT's McGovern Institute for Brain Research, a member of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute, and the senior author of the study. The findings also suggest that identifying the brain circuits affected by mutated genes linked to psychiatric disease could help scientists develop more personalized treatments for patients in the future, Feng says. The paper's lead authors are McGovern Institute research scientist Yang Zhou, graduate students Tobias Kaiser and Xiangyu Zhang, and research affiliate Patricia Monteiro. The protein encoded by Shank3 is found in synapses -- the junctions between neurons that allow them to communicate with each other. Shank3 is a scaffold protein, meaning it helps to organize hundreds of other proteins clustered on the postsynaptic cell membrane, which are required to coordinate the cell's response to signals from the presynaptic cell. In 2011, Feng and colleagues showed that by deleting Shank3 in mice they could induce two of the most common traits of autism -- avoidance of social interaction, and compulsive, repetitive behavior. A year earlier, researchers at the University of Montreal identified a Shank3 mutation in patients suffering from schizophrenia, which is characterized by hallucinations, cognitive impairment, and abnormal social behavior. Feng wanted to find out how these two different mutations in the Shank3 gene could play a role in such different disorders. To do that, he and his colleagues engineered mice with each of the two mutations: The schizophrenia-related mutation results in a truncated version of the Shank3 protein, while the autism-linked mutation leads to a total loss of the Shank3 protein. Behaviorally, the mice shared many defects, including strong anxiety. However, the mice with the autism mutation had very strong compulsive behavior, manifested by excessive grooming, which was rarely seen in mice with the schizophrenia mutation. In the mice with the schizophrenia mutation, the researchers saw a type of behavior known as social dominance. These mice trimmed the whiskers and facial hair of the genetically normal mice sharing their cages, to an extreme extent. This is a typical way for mice to display their social dominance, Feng says. By activating the mutations in different parts of the brain and at different stages of development, the researchers found that the two mutations affected brain circuits in different ways. The autism mutation exerted its effects early in development, primarily in a part of the brain known as the striatum, which is involved in coordinating motor planning, motivation, and habitual behavior. Feng believes that disruption of synapses in the striatum contributes to the compulsive behavior seen in those mice. In mice carrying the schizophrenia-associated mutation, early development was normal, suggesting that truncated Shank3 can adequately fill in for the normal version during this stage. However, later in life, the truncated version of Shank3 interfered with synaptic functions and connections in the brain's cortex, where executive functions such as thought and planning occur. This suggests that different segments of the protein including the stretch that is missing in the schizophrenia-linked mutation may be crucial for different roles, Feng says. Although only a small percentage of autism patients have mutations in Shank3, many other variant synaptic proteins have been associated with the disorder. Future studies should help to reveal more about the role of the many genes and mutations that contribute to autism and other disorders, Feng says. Shank3 alone has at least 40 identified mutations, he says. ""We cannot consider them all to be the same,"" he says. ""To really model these diseases, precisely mimicking each human mutation is critical."" Understanding exactly how these mutations influence brain circuits should help researchers develop drugs that target those circuits and match them with the patients who would benefit most, Feng says, adding that a tremendous amount of work needs to be done to get to that point. His lab is now investigating what happens in the earliest stages of the development of mice with the autism-related Shank3 mutation, and whether any of those effects can be reversed either during development or later in life.

These star-shaped glial cells are known to have a critical role in synapse creation, nervous tissue repair, and the formation of the blood-brain barrier. But while we have decades of data in mice about these nervous system support cells, how relevant those experiments are to human biology (and the success of potential therapies) has been an open question. This month in the journal Neuron, Stanford researchers present the first functional and molecular comparison of human and mouse astrocytes, and while 85%-90% of the genes are similar, human astrocytes have unique genes and respond differently to neurotransmitters, particularly glutamate. This presumably means that, at the adult stage, human astrocytes, in contrast to mouse astrocytes, are better at detecting neuroactivity and adjusting their functions in response. ""We are only beginning to understand the unique properties of human astrocytes,"" says first author Ye Zhang, a postdoctoral scholar in Stanford University School of Medicine's Department of Neurobiology. ""We found hundreds of genes expressed exclusively by human astrocytes, and future studies will likely reveal additional biological differences. Potentially, this work will help us recognize the role of these cells in biological disorders."" The study of human astrocytes has faced issues related to access (samples of living tissue must be obtained from brain cancer or epilepsy surgeries or fetal tissue) and purification (breaking apart astrocytes away from other cells often killed them and many experiments ended in failure). Zhang, co-first author and graduate student Steven Sloan, and their faculty mentor, senior author and professor Ben Barres, overcame the technical challenges by developing an antibody-driven protocol that isolates astrocytes and keeps them alive in culture. This method also allowed the researchers to compare astrocytes in healthy tissue versus those coming from people with glioblastoma or epilepsy. It's known from mouse studies that astrocytes become highly reactive in these diseases, but what this means remains unclear. Genes that produce both positive and negative effects are expressed during these active periods, and through this study, some of the good and bad genes in humans are beginning to be parsed out. The next step is to screen for drugs that can promote or quell the expression of specific genes. Another surprising discovery was that astrocytes come in two distinct stages (progenitor and mature) and that early-stage astrocytes and brain cancer closely resemble one another. This brings up the possibility that brain cancer cells that originate from glial cells can be forced into a mature state and thus unable to divide. The authors note that this finding could not have been made without the use of fetal tissue. ""Such knowledge could not have been obtained without access to fetal tissue,"" Zhang says. ""We can't guess the biology of human brains and neurodevelopmental disorders just by studying mouse brains."" With their new method, Zhang and her colleagues hope to soon begin looking at the unique properties of human astrocyte cells in a range of disease types, including Alzheimer's, ALS, stroke, injury, autism, and schizophrenia.

The origin of this gender bias is not understood, partially due to a major gap in research on sex differences regarding how the brain typically develops. According to a new study presented this week (Dec 6-10, 2015) at the annual meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology in Hollywood, Florida, US, female infants have larger volumes of gray matter around the temporal-parietal junction of the brain than males at the time of birth. The temporal-parietal junction, or TP/TPJ, which is found under the temporal bones near the ears, integrates the processing of social information as expressed in others' faces and voices, a function that is impaired in those with autism spectrum disorders. Sex differences in this area of the brain may be a clue as to why males are at higher risk for certain forms of autism spectrum disorders. Dr. Rebecca Knickmeyer's group at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill has been characterizing sex differences in brain development in a group of over 800 normal newborns, who are assessed until they are 2 years old, using brain imaging and measures of sex hormones in saliva. Another main finding in Dr. Knickmeyer's work is that by the age of two, myelination of long fiber tracks in the brain is more developed in males than in females. Dr. Knickmeyer has also shown that a genetic disorder that only occurs in females - Turner syndrome, which is marked by the partial or complete loss of one of the two X sex chromosomes that females have, also involves a significant decrease in brain volume in inferior parietal lobes (just above the TPJ). This suggests that inferior parietal lobe volume can be influenced, at least in females, by sex chromosomes.

Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, they were able to show that success in learning can be predicted by baseline GABA levels. The results of this research were recently published in the journal Cerebral Cortex. Processing information from the environment requires a high level of information integration by the nervous system that relies on both electrical and chemical signaling. One of the most important chemicals in the brain is GABA, which is the main source of cortical inhibition. The levels of GABA have been shown to be critically involved in the brain's ability to adapt and learn, allowing us to effectively improve our senses through repetitive exposure. Previous research from the same lab has shown that by passively stimulating the fingertips with low level electrical currents, tactile acuity can be improved. By applying a similar protocol in conjunction with non-invasive measurements of GABA, the researchers have provided a potential learning-associated mechanism. Put simply, the higher the GABA levels of the primary somatomotor cortex, the greater the sensory learning potential. Importantly, the interdisciplinary Neuroimaging Research Group at the Bergmannsheil University Clinic found that the levels of GABA were not affected by the sensory learning, but rather the magnitude of learning was related to baseline levels of the neurotransmitter. As the researchers explain, ""Among other genetic and anatomical factors interfering with learning, the neurotransmitter GABA plays a vital role in tactile learning. Its baseline concentration lets us predict how efficient passive stimulation will result in learning, as shown by improved tactile discrimination."" Future research aims to provide further insight into the mechanisms of sensory learning. Ruhr-University BochumHeba S et al.

The findings could help improve dementia care and better target the use of music in different stages of dementia. The research is published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. Initially, the researchers recruited 89 dyads of persons with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers to a single-blind randomized controlled trial in which they received a 10-week music coaching intervention involving either regular singing or listening to familiar songs or standard care. Previously, the results from a 9-month longitudinal follow-up with neuropsychological tests and mood questionnaires showed that the musical activities were able to enhance various cognitive skills, such as working memory, executive functions, and orientation, and alleviate depression compared to standard care. Here, the focus of the researchers was to uncover how different clinical and demographic factors influence the specific cognitive and emotional effects of the two music interventions and, thereby, determine who benefits most from music. Looking at the backgrounds of the dementia patients, the researchers systematically evaluated the impact of dementia severity, etiology, age, care situation, and previous musical hobbies on the efficacy of the music interventions. Singing was found to be beneficial for working memory, executive function, and orientation especially in persons with mild dementia and younger (< 80 years) age, whereas music listening was associated with cognitive benefits only in persons with a more advanced level of dementia. Both singing and music listening were more effective in alleviating depression especially in persons with mild, Alzheimer-type dementia. Importantly, the musical background of the persons with dementia (whether they had sung or played an instrument before) did not influence the efficacy of the music interventions. ""Given the increasing global prevalence and burden of dementia and the limited resources in public health care for persons with dementia and their family caregivers, it is important to find alternative ways to maintain and stimulate cognitive, emotional, and social well-being in this population. Our findings suggest that musical leisure activities could be easily applied and widely used in dementia care and rehabilitation.

For the first time, this new tool will allow researchers to peer inside living cells without damaging them   i.e. without having to prepare the sample in advance or stain them. The company will launch its new microscope on Monday at the world s largest cellular biology conference that will be held in San Diego, in the United States. 3D Cell Explorer is a new type of microscope that will add another dimension to our understanding of how cells work. Thanks to its specially designed software, users can tint various parts of a living cell and observe the cell s behavior and reactions in real time at a resolution of 200 nanometers. That s three times smaller than what current microscopes offer. The device works like an MRI scanner: it takes images at different depths in the cell, which it then reassembles using its smart holographic software which can tint any part of the scanned cell based on its refractive index. Medically assisted procreation The success rate of medically assisted procreation is currently around 30%. This rate could improve with this new microscope. These days, the only way to observe spermatozoids and eggs with the same resolution is to stain them, and that kills the cells. So it is impossible to know what would have happened if these cells had been put into contact. The new microscope could offer promising prospects because it makes it possible to observe the various parts of the ovules and spermatozoids in detail before, during and after they come together. This type of longitudinal study could also be useful in other fields of research, including research on cancer, stem cells, cell therapy and histopathology. Nanolive was launched two years ago on the basis of a technology developed by its founder, Yann Cotte, during his doctoral studies at EPFL. Since then, the company has grown with the help of some start-up funds and crowdfunding. Among the first customers for the microscope will be Universities and biotech, medtech, pharmaceutical and cosmetics companies. Nanolive is also developing applications for use by doctors, and these are expected to hit the market in the medium term. A number of laboratory tests, such as the smear test for uterine cancer, could be considerably sped up if they were conducted in the doctor s office with this microscope.  The human body contains 210 types of cells that differ in the structure of the cell envelope and their morphology,  said Lisa Pollaro, who is in charge of communications at Nanolive.

About 10 percent of babies with congenital heart disease which affects the development, structure, and function of the heart are later diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders such as learning disabilities and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. As many as 13 percent of children with severe forms of congenital heart disease also have other types of birth defects. One possible explanation is that children with congenital heart disease may be deprived of sufficient blood and oxygen flow during critical moments in brain development. The investigators explored the possibility that there is a more fundamental, genetic reason behind why neurodevelopmental disorders and congenital heart disease often occur together.  Using the sophisticated tools of genomic sequencing, we can now look deep within the genome and determine if conditions are genetically linked,  said Wendy Chung, MD, PhD, the Kennedy Family Associate Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine, director of the clinical genetics program at CUMC and a clinical geneticist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia.  If such a linkage exists, then we can predict the risk that children with congenital heart disease will develop a neurodevelopmental disorder, allowing interventions to be put in place while the brain is still growing and developing. This kind of highly targeted treatment is the goal of an emerging field known as precision medicine.  In this study, the researchers used genetic information from 1,213 children with congenital heart disease and their parents to analyze the 4,000+ genes that are active during heart development. They then compared this information with previously available sequence data from 900 families not affected by congenital heart disease, to identify genetic mutations. The study revealed that many of the children with congenital heart disease had spontaneous mutations in heart development genes. Furthermore, a single genetic mutation was responsible for about 20 percent of cases of severe congenital heart disease accompanied by neurodevelopmental disorders and/or other congenital problems. These same genes were mutated in only 2 percent of children with congenital heart disease alone, suggesting that the co-occurrence of neurodevelopmental and congenital problems has genetic causes. The researchers also discovered that the mutations in the children born with a combination of heart, brain, and other congenital disorders occurred in a subset of genes that act like conductors, orchestrating the formation and function of organs.  As a clinical geneticist who sees children with a variety of conditions, I find it encouraging when a study has direct and immediate benefits for patients and their families,  said Dr. Chung.  We are seeing genomic sequencing move out of the realm of research and into the clinic as a diagnostic tool, bringing with it the power to predict the risk of many kinds of conditions. This is truly precision medicine at its best. ","Published: December 10, 2015"

Such a device would make possible extremely high-resolution imaging or biological sensing. But scientists had been unable to build and arrange many nanolenses over a large area.  That s where we came in,  said Xiaoying Liu, senior research scientist at the University of Chicago s Institute for Molecular Engineering. Liu and Paul Nealey, the Dougan Professor in Molecular Engineering, teamed with experts in nanophotonics at the Air Force Research Laboratory and Florida State University to invent a novel way to build nanolenses in large arrays using a combination of chemical and lithographic techniques. They aligned three spherical gold nanoparticles of graduated sizes in the string-of-pearls arrangement predicted to produce the focusing effect. The key, said Liu, was control:  We placed each individual nanoparticle building block into exactly the position we wanted it to go. That s the essence of our fabrication technique.  The first step employs the lithographic methods used in making printed circuits to create a chemical mask. Liu and Nealey s mask leaves exposed a pattern of three spots of decreasing size on a substrate such as silicon or glass that won t absorb the gold nanoparticles. DELICATE PATTERNS Lithography allows for extremely precise and delicate patterns, but it can t produce three-dimensional structures. So the scientists used chemistry to build atop the patterned substrate in three dimensions. They treated the spots with polymer chains that were then tethered to the substrate through chemical bonds.  The chemical contrast between the three spots and the background makes the gold particles go only to the spots,  said Liu. To get each of the three sizes of nanospheres to adhere only to its own designated spot, the scientists played with the strength of the chemical interaction between spot and sphere.  We control the size of the different areas in the chemical pattern, and we control the interaction potential of the chemistry of those areas with the nanoparticles,  said Nealey. Only the largest spot has the amount of force needed to attract and hold the largest particle; the interaction of the particle with the middle and the small spots is too weak. When the big spheres are adsorbed, the scientists use the same trick to put the medium-sized spheres onto the medium-sized spots, and finally move on to the smallest.  It s like the Three Bears story,  said Nealey.  We can put big ones on the big spots, but they won t stick to the smaller spots; then put the next-sized one on the medium spot, but it won t stick to the small spot. By this sequential manufacturing we re able to arrive at these precise assemblies of three different-sized particles in close proximity to one another.  TINY SEPARATIONS The spheres are separated by only a few nanometers. It is this tiny separation, coupled with the sequential ordering of the different-sized spheres, that produces the nanolensing effect.  You get this concentration in the intensity of the light between the small- and the medium-sized nanoparticles,  said Nealey. The scientists are already exploring using this  hot spot  for high-resolution sensing using spectroscopy.  If you put a molecule there, it will interact with the focused light,  said Liu.  The enhanced field at these hot spots will help you to get orders of magnitude stronger signals, and that gives us the opportunity to get ultra-sensitive sensing. Maybe ultimately we can detect single molecules.  The researchers also foresee applying their manufacturing technique to nanoparticles of other shapes, such as rods and stars.  The physics of particles shaped differently than spheres enable even a wider spectrum of applications,  said Nealey.  There s a large range of properties that you could realize by putting particles with asymmetric shapes next to each other.  The method will have broad application for any process that requires precision placement of materials in proximity to the same or different types of materials. It will, Nealey predicts,  be part of the way that nanomanufacturing is done. ","Published: December 10, 2015"

In addition to their universal role in deciphering the genetic code to build proteins, ribosomes are also important targets for antibiotic treatments. It is difficult to form ribosomes into crystals so they can be studied with X-rays because they are very fragile. The new system sprang from a desire to better preserve the ribosome crystals. The research team did this by keeping the tiny crystals in the same solution they were grown in at temperatures approaching those in their natural environment, and by finding a more gentle way to deliver or ""inject"" them into a vacuum chamber, where they are struck by LCLS X-ray pulses. One Stream Protects Another The new system, dubbed coMESH, uses low-cost, off-the-shelf components to shape and protect a stream of crystallized proteins with a surrounding stream of electrically charged fluid. ""Our strategy was to come up with an injector that can handle anything, not just ribosomes,"" DeMirci said. ""We are addressing a definite need in the scientific community for a more universal way to deliver samples to LCLS."" In addition to demonstrating that the new system worked, the experiments also gave the scientists a more detailed, 3-D look at how one component of the ribosome binds to an antibiotic called paromomycin that is used to treat parasitic infections. ""Now we have a more realistic picture of how this antibiotic interacts with ribosomes at temperatures close to those in their natural environment,"" DeMirci said. The new system consists of a thin tube, about one-tenth of a millimeter in diameter, inside a slightly larger tube; the sizes can vary based on the dimensions of the crystal samples. A charging electrode applies low electrical current to the fluid in the larger tube, which focuses the flow to a thin filament. Both tubes end at the same point and the electrical current in the outer fluid greatly narrows both streams of fluid as they emerge from the tubes. Less Damage and Waste The system is also designed to waste fewer crystals in experiments than some other sample delivery methods. The thickness and flow rate of the inner stream can be fine-tuned by changing the applied voltage and the width of the tubing to maximize the rate at which X-ray pulses strike the crystals flowing into their path. DeMirci and Sierra said that based on the 3-D atomic-scale details they were able to see in the ribosome-drug complex and in samples of a photosynthetic protein complex known as photosystem-II, it doesn't appear the voltage damaged the protein structures. ""It's like birds sitting on an electrical wire,"" DeMirci said. DeMirci and Sierra said they expect the coMESH system will find wider use by other scientists conducting experiments at LCLS. ""We want this to be 'plug-and-play,'"" Sierra said, ""so all they have to think about during their experiment is collecting data and not troubleshooting sample delivery.""","Published: December 10, 2015"

When ultrasonic pressure waves move through a liquid, they can cause bubbles to form and oscillate rapidly around gaseous imperfections. If these so-called cavitation bubbles collapse very close to a boundary or the surface of another bubble, they can produce fast-moving jets to erupt in their wake. The phenomenon can be so powerful that it can cause severe damage to ship propellers. Cavitation bubbles form as high-amplitude ultrasonic pressure waves travel through liquid. While commonly exploited in many medical procedures, their interactions with tissues are not clearly understood, especially at the cellular level. Cavitation bubbles are also behind a recent finding from Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto in which a team successfully delivered cancer drugs through the blood-brain barrier of a patient. In a new study, Duke researchers used high-speed, high-resolution cameras to reveal minute details of how cavitation bubbles affect nearby cells.  The effects of these powerful little bubbles on living cells  have long been a  black box  where results are hard to predict and it is unknown why certain outcomes occur,  said Pei Zhong, the Anderson-Rupp Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Duke.  We hope this new experimental system can provide much-needed mechanistic insights, which could help optimize therapeutic procedures and lead to new creative treatments.  Depending on the proximity of the bubbles, these jets can rapidly stretch nearby cells, poke holes in them or even obliterate their membranes. Understanding how different cells react to these jets will inform a wide variety of medical techniques, Zhong said.  The experimental control and precision we have developed is unprecedented,  said Zhong.  We have created a unique and versatile tool to study how cells respond to cavitation-induced shear flows. Future results providing mechanical characterizations of individual cells could be harnessed for disease diagnosis and treatment monitoring.  The new technique begins with a microfluidic chamber -- a glass slide with a silicone channel that is filled with fluid. A laser pulse passes through the bottom of the glass slide and strikes the opposite side, which is covered in tiny gold dots near individual cells that are grown in patterned islands. When the focused, pulsed laser strikes a gold dot, it vaporizes the surrounding fluid, causing a cavitation bubble to form. By creating two bubbles side-by-side at slightly different times, the researchers can control the direction of the resulting jet when the bubbles collapse. In their experiments, Zhong and his team placed individual cells at different distances away from these jets to observe how they react to different levels of shear stress. The results have already yielded some interesting insights.  Previous studies have shown that cell membranes can only withstand a three percent increase in area strain before rupturing,  said Zhong.  But these experiments stretched the membrane for a second or longer. Our results have shown that if the membrane is stretched for a millisecond or less, it can actually withstand strains an order of magnitude higher before a minute pore is formed. And importantly, small pores can reseal, allowing the target cell to fully recover. Observations such as these could open the door to new or improved therapies. ","Published: December 10, 2015"

Just as importantly, it demonstrates the potential of the new technique, which enables researchers to quickly find drug candidates that activate cellular receptors in desired ways.  In principle, we can apply this technique to hundreds of other receptors like the one we targeted in this study to find disease treatments that are more potent and have fewer side effects than existing therapies. It has been a very productive cross-campus collaboration, so we re hoping to build on its success as we continue to collaborate on interrogating potential therapeutic targets,  said Patricia H. McDonald, an assistant professor at TSRI s Jupiter, Florida campus and a senior investigator of the study. McDonald s laboratory collaborated on the study with the laboratory of Richard A. Lerner, the Lita Annenberg Hazen Professor of Immunochemistry at TSRI s La Jolla campus, and with other TSRI groups. Lerner has pioneered techniques for generating and screening large libraries of antibodies or proteins to find new therapies. In Search of a Better Activator Three years ago, Lerner and colleagues devised a technique called autocrine selection, which enables scientists to screen very large libraries of molecules to find those that not only bind a given cellular receptor but also activate it to bring about a desired therapeutic effect. Since then, the Lerner laboratory and collaborating scientists have used the technique to find new molecules that block cold virus infection, boost red blood cell production and kill cancer cells, among other effects. For the new study, Lerner and his laboratory used the technique to target a receptor linked to type 2 diabetes, a life-shortening disease estimated to affect 30 million people in the US alone. The GLP-1 receptor, as it is known, is expressed by insulin-producing  beta cells  in the pancreas. Several drugs that activate this receptor drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists are already approved for treating type 2 diabetes. In this case, the TSRI team s aim was to find a molecule that activates the GLP-1 receptor in a unique way. The GLP-1 receptor belongs to a large class of receptors known as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Scientists recently have come to understand that when a molecule activates a GPCR, it doesn t necessarily trigger a single chain of biochemical signals within the cell. In fact, most GPCR agonists trigger signals via multiple distinct pathways one being via a so-called G protein and another via a protein known as beta-arrestin. In some cases, a  biased agonist  that principally activates just one of these pathways would work better than one that activates both. In this case, Lerner and his laboratory teamed up with McDonald, an expert on GPCRs and metabolic disease, to find a molecule that would preferentially activate the GLP-1 receptor s G protein pathway. To start, researchers in Lerner s laboratory, including Hongkai Zhang, a senior staff scientist and co-first author of the study, generated a library of candidate molecules based on a known GLP-1 receptor agonist, Exendin-4, a small protein (peptide) originally found in the venom of Gila monster lizards; a synthetic version of this protein is now used as a type 2 diabetes medication. Zhang created about one million new peptides by randomly varying one end of Exendin-4 the end that normally activates the G protein and beta arrestin pathways.  The idea was that at least one of these many variants would induce a change in the shape of the GLP-1 receptor that would activate the G-protein pathway without activating the beta arrestin pathway,  Zhang said. Using the autocrine selection system, Zhang and colleagues rapidly screened these variant peptides and eventually isolated one, P5, that potently and selectively activated the GLP-1 receptor s G-protein pathway. An initial test in healthy mice showed that P5 worked well at boosting glucose tolerance at about one-hundredth the dose of Exendin-4 needed for the same effect. Protein expert Philip E. Dawson, an associate professor at TSRI s La Jolla campus, synthesized sufficient quantities of P5, and McDonald and her laboratory performed more advanced tests in cultured cells and in mice. A Different Mechanism Exendin-4 and and other GLP-1 receptor agonists work in part by strongly stimulating pancreatic beta cells to produce more insulin which signals muscle and fat cells to draw glucose from the blood, thus lowering blood glucose levels. McDonald and her team found that although P5 equals or outperforms Exendin-4 in standard mouse models of diabetes, it stimulates insulin production only weakly.  We didn t expect that, but in fact, it was a nice finding because less reliance on stimulating insulin could mean less stress on the beta cells,  said Emmanuel Sturchler, staff scientist in the McDonald laboratory and co-first author of the study. Investigating further, the team found that while the peptide doesn t make mice fatter or heavier, it triggers the growth of new fat cells. In typical obesity-related diabetes, fat cells grow larger, not more numerous, and as they grow larger, they lose their ability to respond to insulin (insulin resistance). The proliferation of fat cells with P5 was accompanied by signs of increased insulin sensitivity in those cells, suggesting that the peptide works in part by alleviating insulin resistance. Exendin-4 induces a feeling of satiety, causing mice (and people) to modestly lower food intake and thus lose weight. But the researchers found that P5 lacks this mechanism and appears to have no effect on appetite or weight.  P5 s mechanisms of action turned out to be quite different from Exendin-4 s, and we think that this finding could lead to new therapeutics,  Sturchler said. The team will now look for opportunities to develop P5 into a new diabetes drug. The researchers also see this as the first of many discoveries of GPCR-targeting compounds with unique and potentially valuable properties as well as discoveries in basic GPCR biology.","Published: December 10, 2015"

The advent of modern medical diagnostic tools has made it possible to identify the hallmarks of innumerable diseases with simple, reliable tests that portray the inner workings of the body in exquisite detail allowing doctors to pinpoint the specific cause of a patient's complaint and prescribe the proper course of treatment. The same cannot be said, however, for the field of psychiatry. Despite advances in technology, there are no objective medical tests to diagnose mental disorders. Psychiatrists cannot find evidence of schizophrenia in a blood sample; they can't see bipolar disorder in an X-ray. ""Psychiatry still relies on symptoms as the basis of a diagnosis,"" said the study's lead author Brett Clementz, a professor of psychology in UGA's Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. ""It would be like using the presence of fever to diagnose a specific infection. We need some means to help us more accurately differentiate mental disorders."" To that end, Clementz and his colleagues created an experimental program that uses neurobiological measures rather than symptoms to identify disease types. They focused exclusively on patients suffering from psychosis a broad category of mental disorder that includes schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder with psychosis to see if they could improve upon existing methods. Mental health professionals traditionally use criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM, to identify specific mental disorders based on observable symptoms, which, in the case of psychosis, may include hallucinations, delusions, radical changes in personality or a distorted sense of reality. ""We wanted to try to provide neurobiological underpinnings for DSM-type psychosis diagnoses,"" Clementz said. The research team recruited more than 700 patients with psychosis and some of their first-degree relatives a parent, sibling or child as well as a control group of healthy individuals to see if they could identify brain-based diagnostic markers to differentiate these conditions. Each participant went through a battery of tests designed to assess their cognitive abilities, including MRI scans and specially designed examinations that asked participants to respond to simple visual or auditory cues, which reveal sensory and perceptual abnormalities. Researchers used these measures to identify different ""biotypes"" of mental disorders, which proved to be superior to DSM standards. ""We were better able to predict who had family histories of psychoses, structural brain abnormalities and measures of social functioning when compared with DSM standards,"" Clementz said. In addition to finding more accurate ways of categorizing disease types, the researchers hope that this project may inspire a renewed interest in psychiatric drug development, which has been stymied recently by a lack of clear biological targets. ""Psychiatry has relied mostly on serendipity for new drugs,"" Clementz said. ""All of the medications that we use for psychosis have mostly the same mechanism of action, and there are no unique treatments for the various diagnoses. ""You can't, for example, use an animal model for schizophrenia. How do you find a schizophrenic mouse? But if we can identify a biological mechanism that contributes to disease, then we may reinvigorate drug development, and that's what we're trying to provide."" Clementz is quick to caution that there is still much work to be done before these measures could be used for new diagnostics or to measure drug efficacy, but he is hopeful that this work will lead to much needed advances in the field. ""We're a long way from identifying specific disease mechanisms, but we're a step closer than we were when we focused on clinical symptoms alone,"" he said.","Published: December 10, 2015"

One such illness, African sleeping sickness, is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, transmitted by the tsetse fly, and is fatal if left untreated. The trypanosome parasite is transmitted to mammals through fly bites and eventually invades major organs such as the brain, disrupting the sleep cycle, among other symptoms. Trypanosomes exist in different forms. When inhabiting a fly, they are covered with proteins called procyclins. But upon entering the bloodstream of a mammal, they acquire a dense layer of glycoproteins that continually change, allowing the parasite to dodge an attack from the host s immune system. Now, new research from postdoctoral scientists Danae Schulz and Erik Debler, working in Nina Papavasiliou s and G nter Blobel s labs at Rockefeller University, reveals a method to manipulate trypanosomes in the mammalian bloodstream to acquire fly stage characteristics, a state that makes it easier for the host immune system to eliminate the invader. The findings suggest that inhibiting specific proteins that interact with chromatin the mass of DNA and proteins that packages a cell s genetic information can  trick  the parasite into differentiating to a different stage of its lifecycle.By blocking these chromatin-interacting proteins, we have found a way to make the parasite visible to the immune system,  says Nina Papavasiliou, head of the Laboratory of Lymphocyte Biology.  The bloodstream form of the parasite is constantly switching protein coats, so the immune system can t recognize and eliminate it. This new method makes the parasite think it s in the fly, where it doesn t need to worry about the immune system attacking it.  Epigenetic regulation Regulatory proteins interact with chromatin to either unwind it or package it more tightly, affecting which genes are expressed. Some of these regulatory proteins contain a region called the bromodomain, which recognizes a specific signal on chromatin and induces changes in gene expression. Recent findings in mice have indicated that bromodomains are involved in cell differentiation, which led Papavasiliou and colleagues to hypothesize that such epigenetic mechanisms may drive the trypanosome to change from one form to another.  The changes in gene expression that accompany the transition between the different parasite forms had been well established,  said Schulz, the lead author of the study.  But we didn t understand if there was some type of regulation happening at DNA, at the level of chromatin. Whether chromatin-altering mechanisms might be important for differentiation hadn t really been studied before.  To investigate this, the researchers inhibited bromodomain proteins in cells by introducing genetic mutations in their DNA or by exposing the cells to a small-molecule drug called I-BET151, which is known to block bromodomains in mammals. When these perturbations were made, the investigators observed changes in gene expression levels that resembled those seen in cells differentiating from the bloodstream form to the fly form. They also saw that the parasites developed a procyclin coat normally found on the fly form. Based on these findings, Papavasiliou and colleagues suggest that proteins with bromodomains maintain the bloodstream form of trypanosomes, and inhibiting them causes the parasite to progress in its development toward the fly form. They believe bromodomains could serve as a potential therapeutic target to treat African sleeping sickness. Harnessing the natural immune system To explore whether I-BET151 could be used to combat the disease, the researchers used drug-treated trypanosomes to infect mice. The mice infected with drug-treated trypanosomes survived significantly longer than those infected with untreated trypanosomes, indicating that the virulence of the parasite its ability to invade the host was diminished in the presence of I-BET151.  When bromodomains are inhibited, the variant protein coat is replaced with an unvarying coat on the surface of the trypanosome cell,  says Schulz.  This means that the parasite surface is no longer a moving target, giving the immune system enough time to eliminate it.  I-BET151 is not effective enough to be used in the clinic, but a crystal structure determined by Debler and published as part of this study provides direct clues for how an optimized drug could be designed to bind parasite bromodomains in a highly specific manner, limiting side effects.  Current treatments for this disease are limited and they have substantial side effects, including very high mortality rates,  says Papavasiliou.  This study, and recent work by others, demonstrates that targeting chromatin-interacting proteins offers a promising new avenue to develop therapeutics.  This could apply not only to African sleeping sickness, she adds, but to a number of related parasitic diseases like Chagas or malaria, with disease burdens that are far more substantial than those caused by Trypanosoma brucei.","Published: December 10, 2015"

Now, new research indicates that such decision-making tendencies have a genetic link to brain pathways that underlie these disorders. The researchers, at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, report their findings Tuesday, Dec. 8, at the annual meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, in Hollywood, Fla. Studying adolescent twins, the researchers found that genes linked to the brain s serotonin and kappa opioid receptors   neuronal receptors associated with mood, depression and addiction   also play a role in whether a person will choose an immediate reward over a more sizeable payoff later. The scientists also learned that adolescents become slightly more likely to accept delayed rewards as they age but that those who prefer immediate rewards tend to continue choosing quick payoffs.  Every day we make decisions about obtaining immediate gains, which come at the cost of delayed but larger advantages,  said principal investigator Andrey Anokhin, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry.  We found that many such decisions are explained by genetic factors that also are related to mood and impulsivity.  Anokhin s team studied 310 adolescent identical or fraternal twin pairs and asked them questions about money. At 12 years of age, and again at age 14, they were given the choice of receiving $7 immediately or $10 in the mail two weeks later. At age 12, 35 percent decided to take $7 right away instead of more money later. That number fell to 27.5 percent when the same kids were presented the scenario at age 14. In subsequent experiments at ages 16, 18 and 20, the same subjects were offered hypothetical monetary rewards, $80 now or $100 six months from now, for example.  We vary the amount of the reward available immediately, the amount of the delayed reward and the time they would have to wait,  Anokhin said.  If you offer someone the choice between $95 today or $100 in six months, most people would rather have the cash immediately. But what if the choice is between $85 today or $100 in three months? At that point, some people prefer delaying the reward to make an extra $15.  Because the adolescent study subjects were twins, the researchers were able to use mathematical formulas to analyze the impact of genetic factors on their decisions. The scientists looked at several genes previously linked to impulsivity and substance use. First, they found that serotonin genes were involved. But a closer look indicated that genes related to kappa opioid receptors on brain cells appeared to be even more crucial in making these decisions, Anokhin explained.  The top three genes we ve identified so far are linked to those receptors,  he said. Serotonin genes and kappa opioid receptor genes are connected to mood. In animal studies, both types of receptors have been linked to behaviors associated with depression and addiction, and Anokhin said the new research indicates they also appear linked to whether a person chooses immediate over delayed rewards. When an individual doesn t want to wait for a larger reward, that could be an indication that the person is impulsive, Anokhin said. Impulsivity increases the risk for problems such as alcoholism, drug addiction and obesity. As twins in the study have aged, Anokhin and his colleagues have begun looking for possible connections between this sort of decision-making and binge drinking, drug use and nicotine dependence.  We need to look more closely before drawing conclusions, but we want to see what the consequences of the differences we ve identified are for real-life behaviors,  he said.","Published: December 10, 2015"

A hallmark of severe mental illness, psychosis is marked by hallucinations and delusions, or false, irrational beliefs. ""The biotypes were more biologically homogeneous than categories based on observable symptoms,"" explained Bruce Cuthbert, Ph.D., acting director of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which funded the study. ""Just as fever or infection can have many different causes, multiple psychosis-causing disease processes -- operating via different biological pathways -- can lead to similar symptoms, confounding the search for better care."" The results lend support to the institute's Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDoC) initiative (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/highlights/highlight-what-is-rdoc.shtml), which frees scientists from designing research based on traditional diagnostic categories, encouraging them to explore groupings based on genomics, behavioral dimensions, physiological traits, or brain imaging findings. More precise diagnosis is expected to lead to improved treatments. NIMH-funded researchers Carol Tamminga, M.D., of the University of Texas, Austin; Brett Clementz, Ph.D., of the University of Georgia, Athens; and colleagues at other research centers, report on their multi-site study on Dec. 8, 2015 in the American Journal of Psychiatry. The new findings come from a project called The Bipolar Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (BSNIP). They add to increasing evidence of biological overlap between traditional, symptom-based diagnostic categories for disorders in which patients experience psychotic symptoms. The BSNIP study used sophisticated statistical approaches to sort such cases into homogeneous subgroups, based on multiple neurobiological measures and levels of analysis. The researchers examined key biological and behavioral measures linked to psychosis in 1,872 participants - patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder with psychosis, their first-degree relatives and healthy control subjects. Measures such as performance on thinking, planning and memory tasks, eye-tracking, inhibition, and brainwave responses to auditory stimuli identified sets of biomarkers that differentiated subgroups of patients. Three distinct psychosis-related biotypes emerged that cut across clinical diagnosis boundaries. These subsets of biomarkers differentiated groupings of psychosis cases from each other considerably better than did traditional clinical diagnoses. External measures -- social functioning, brain structure, and rates of psychosis-related illness and biomarker patterns in patients' first-degree relatives -- also validated the neurobiological distinctiveness of the biotype subgroups more than they did the distinctiveness of symptom-based categories. People with different biotypes differed in their mix of psychosis-related impairments. For example, cases classified as Biotype 1 showed the most severe impairment in a set of brain functions that the researchers distilled into a construct they call ""cognitive control"" -- the ability to flexibly exert control over attention and information processing to meet one's goals. Biotype 1 cases were also the most socially impaired. Biotype 2 cases showed intermediate levels of impaired cognitive control, but had normal to accentuated brain responses to sensory inputs and fast visual orienting, a set of brain functions called ""sensorimotor reactivity"" - the ability to detect and process sensory stimuli. Those classified as Biotype 3 showed normal cognitive control, modestly impaired sensorimotor reactivity, were the least socially impaired and had the lowest positive (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) and negative (e.g., blunted emotion) symptoms. Each biotype overlapped with the traditional diagnostic categories. For example, among Biotype 1 cases, 59 percent had a schizophrenia diagnosis, while among Biotype 3 cases 44 percent had a bipolar disorder with psychosis diagnosis. Among Biotype 3 cases, 32 percent had schizophrenia, and among Biotype 1 cases, 20 percent had bipolar disorder with psychosis. Differences in brain structure also distinguish the three biotypes, further validating the categorizations. On brain MRI scans, Biotype 1 cases -- and to a lesser degree Biotype 2 cases -- showed reduced gray matter, the brain's working tissue, across several areas of the cortex, or outer mantle, known to process higher-order information. By contrast, in Biotype 3 cases, the largest of the groups, such reduced gray matter was mostly localized in emotion-processing areas in deeper brain regions. No brain structural differences distinguished the traditional categories of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder from each other. Unaffected first-degree relatives of psychosis cases tended to show similar, but reduced, abnormalities in cognitive control, sensorimotor reactivity, social functioning and brain structure, suggesting that they may harbor ""constitutional"" risk factors for the biotypes. The different patterns of biomarkers across the biotypes may help to explain discrepancies in replicating biomarker studies across different clinical research centers, say the researchers. For example, since they tend to be the most compromised, Biotype 1 cases are more likely to be recruited in inpatient settings, while Biotype 2 and -3 cases are more likely to be found in outpatient settings. So even if patients have the same nominal diagnosis, they might tend to have different underlying illness processes. Similarly, researchers with mostly Biotype 3 cases might conclude that not much can be learned from studying first-degree relatives (their relatives were largely normal on the biomarkers) -- and/or that a large portion of the genetic risk for psychosis comes from spontaneous mutations. ""The biotypes outcome provides proof-of-concept that structural and functional brain biomarker measures can sort individuals with psychosis into groups that are neurobiologically distinctive and appear biologically meaningful,"" said Dr. Tamminga. The new findings suggest several leads for future research, say the investigators. Biotypes 1 and 2 may lend themselves to genetic studies, while Biotype 3 cases may yield more leads on environmental contributions to psychosis risk. Treatments for Biotype 1 should target cognitive control and enhance brain mechanisms for discerning the relevance of environmental stimuli. Cases with Biotypes 1 and 2 might be good candidates for treatments that correct neuronal activity levels through effects on cellular potassium or calcium channels.","Published: December 10, 2015"

The identification of the NEK7 enzyme s switch-like activity in immunity could lead to new treatments for a variety of medical conditions linked to inflammation via the NRLP3 inflammasome pathway, including certain metabolic disorders, influenza A, gout, atherosclerosis, and possibly some forms of cancer. The current study investigated mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis.  NRLP3 is one of several inflammasomes   multiprotein structures in disease-fighting white blood cells   the first of which was identified less than 15 years ago. The NRLP3 complex responds to microbes and other danger signals by activating molecules called cytokines, such as interleukin-1 beta, which trigger inflammation to fight infection,  said Nobel Laureate Dr. Bruce Beutler, Director of the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense at UT Southwestern and senior author of the study published online in Nature Immunology. The paper s lead author is Dr. Hexin Shi, a postdoctoral researcher in the Center, who identified the gene for the enzyme and then worked to characterize the enzyme s role as a new component of the inflammasome. The research effort marshaled a large team working under one of the National Institutes of Health s U19 grants, which are awarded for far-ranging, multidisciplinary research projects such as this one that involve genetics, immunology, physiology, and computational biology. The researchers genetically screened thousands of mice and conducted exhaustive interdisciplinary experiments: identifying a defect in inflammasome function, ascribing that defect to a mutation in the gene for the NEK7 enzyme, and fully characterizing NEK7 function in innate immunity. The enzyme was previously known only for its involvement in cell division, or mitosis, a process that involves the creation of two daughter cells from one parental cell. Specifically, mitosis is the phase of cell division in which the nucleus, which holds all of the cell s genetic material, divides to form two new cells, each with a full complement of genes.  Our work has shown that the inflammasome cannot become activated during mitosis. This is possibly a protective mechanism that prevents damage to DNA during this part of the cell cycle,  said Dr. Beutler, who shared the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his groundbreaking work on innate immunity. Dr. Beutler, a Texas Regental Professor, also holds the Raymond and Ellen Willie Distinguished Chair in Cancer Research, in Honor of Laverne and Raymond Willie, Sr. The U19 grant is based at Scripps Research Institute near San Diego, Calif., Dr. Beutler s former research institution, which describes its focus as  innovative technologies that will ultimately provide data for improving a wide range of human diseases that include viral and bacterial infections and inherited immune disorders.  The grant is led by study co-author Dr. Richard Ulevitch, Professor and Chairman Emeritus of Immunology at Scripps.

This research is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The scientists observed that these cells seem to be repelled by the amyloid plaques. These plaques are associated with development of Alzheimer's disease and several therapeutic strategies are aimed at reducing their formation and eliminating them. Up to now researchers thought that the astrocytes migrated towards the amyloid plaques and devoured them, so that reinforcing their activity could be a good remedy against development of the disease. However, this analysis of astrocyte distribution shows the opposite: the astrocytes seem to be repelled by the plaques. ""This discovery is very important, as the elimination of amyloid plaques by the brain cells themselves is one of the key strategies under development as a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, clarifying which cells can and cannot eliminate the plaques is essential for obtaining effective therapies"", explains Elena Galea, a researcher at the UAB's Institute of Neuroscience and ICREA lecturer. The research sought to identify the forces that shape the interaction between the astrocytes and the amyloid plaques in order to obtain a representation of the relative positions they adopt. To this end it borrowed techniques from statistical physics used to determine, for example, the evolution of the galaxies based on the forces of interaction between the stars that compose them. Instead of galaxies and stars, the scientists analyzed 3-dimensional images of the astrocytes inside the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Statistical analysis of these 3-dimensional images shows that the astrocytes repel each other, and that they are also repelled by the amyloid plaques. Thus, the balance between these forces of repulsion maintains the ""territorial organisation"" of the astrocytes, and when there are many plaques this induces a spatial tension in the astrocytes. In the words of Elena Galea, perhaps the most important information this study provides is that ""contrary to what Alzheimer's researchers assume, the astrocytes do not break up this organization to move towards the plaques and phagocytose them. Rather, they move slightly away from them"". Nevertheless, the astrocytes must ""feel"" something when plaques are formed, as when this happens they produce more of their characteristic protein, GFAP. ""This implies that the astrocytes could be reacting against the formation of amyloid plaques by modifying their function rather than changing position, concludes Galea.

The study, published in the journal Stroke, marks the first time that VNS has been tested in individuals recovering from stroke. VNS already has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for certain illnesses, such as depression and epilepsy. It involves sending a mild electric pulse through the vagus nerve in the neck. Stimulating this nerve relays information about the state of the body to the brain and encourages neural plasticity. The study demonstrated that the VNS experimental treatment is safe in patients recovering from stroke. According to study co-author Dr. Michael Kilgard, professor of neuroscience, it also showed significant potential for reducing impairments among stroke patients. ""This 'first-in-humans' study appears to demonstrate improvement in the recovery that stroke patients make,"" Kilgard said. ""This was a small study and there is more work to be done, but this is an exciting result."" According to the American Stroke Association, nearly 800,000 people in the United States are stricken by strokes each year. Eighty percent of stroke survivors are impacted by hemiparesis, a weakness on one side of the body that could last a lifetime. Oral drug therapies have shown little success in reducing impairments and disabilities. The VNS study included 20 stroke patients who experienced arm weakness due to stroke. The participants were randomly placed into two groups: one with patients who only received rehabilitation therapy, and one with patients who received rehabilitation therapy as well as VNS experimental therapy. The therapy was six weeks long for both groups. The group that only received rehabilitation improved by an average of three points on the Fugl-Meyer assessment scale, which measures recovery in stroke patients. The group that received rehabilitation and the VNS experimental treatment improved by an average of nine points. While specific results varied among the patients, several who received VNS reported greater motion and strength in their stroke-affected arms. ""This study demonstrates that vagus nerve stimulation appears to improve the recovery that stroke patients make,"" said Kilgard, who is the Margaret Fonde Jonsson Professor. ""VNS is triggered on successful movements to solidify gains that are made during physical therapy."" The trial occurred in Glasgow, Scotland. But Kilgard said UT Dallas and UT Southwestern Medical Center have opened a new trial that can provide VNS experimental therapy for local stroke patients. ""We are seeking several stroke patients in the Dallas area, each of whom will receive a VNS device as well as physical rehabilitation. We are looking forward to bringing this technology to U.S. patients for the very first time,"" he said. Dr. Robert Rennaker, Texas Instruments Distinguished Chair in Bioengineering, director of the Texas Biomedical Device Center and chairman of the Department of Bioengineering was a co-author of the study. He said a key factor in the new study is that it is double-blind, placebo-controlled, and at multiple sites, which is the highest standard for a clinical trial. He said that although it is placebo-controlled, all patients will receive the device and the full therapy. ""We already have seen a number of benefits from vagus nerve stimulation for other conditions,"" Rennaker said. ""We hope that we ultimately will see such success for stroke patients.""

Recent studies show that pomegranate extract, which is a rich source of disease-fighting polyphenols, can help protect against the development of Alzheimer s disease. But researchers weren t sure which molecules to thank. A team reports in ACS Chemical Neuroscience that the responsible compounds may be urolithins, which are made when gut bacteria break down the polyphenols in the extract. Alzheimer s disease is associated with  -amyloid (A ) fibrillation, a process in which amyloid proteins in the brain form clumps. To fight the formation of these fibrils, however, a molecule would have to cross the blood-brain barrier. In previous work, the researchers showed that a pomegranate extract has anti-Alzheimer s effects in animals, but they did not identify the compounds responsible. Navindra Seeram and colleagues wanted to investigate which compounds in pomegranate could both pass through the blood-brain barrier and prevent A  fibrils from forming. The team isolated and identified 21 compounds mostly polyphenols from the pomegranate extract. Computational studies found that polyphenols could not cross the blood-brain barrier, but that urolithins could. Urolithins are anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective compounds that are formed when ellagitannins, a type of polyphenol, are metabolized by gut bacteria. The researchers then showed that urolithins reduced A  fibrillation levels in vitro. Additionally, these compounds increased the lifespan of an Alzheimer s roundworm model. They say further tests are needed to determine whether the protective effects of these compounds could ultimately help prevent or treat Alzheimer s in humans.

A team from Oxford University, led by Dr Grant Churchill and Dr Sridhar Vasudevan of the Department of Pharmacology, in collaboration with Professor Phil Cowen of the Department of Psychiatry, used a database of 'failed' drugs, found to be safe but ineffective for their proposed use, to identify ebselen as a possible alternative to lithium, the main treatment for people who have bipolar disorder. Ebselen was under development as a treatment for stroke, but was abandoned by its manufacturer in the final phase of clinical trials. However, those trials proved that the drug was safe for use in humans. Initial tests of ebselen as a treatment for bipolar disorder were carried out in mice. That research, reported in early 2014, found that results were promising, so the researchers were able to use the existing safety information to fast track an initial trial of ebselen in people. Dr Grant Churchill explained: 'Lithium has been used for over 60 years and remains the most effective treatment for bipolar disorder, but suffers from toxicity and has many side effects. It is toxic at only twice the right dose and can cause weight gain and thirst. Long-term lithium use can lead to kidney damage. The side effects also encourage people to stop taking it, which means they can relapse. 'An alternative treatment that has fewer side effects would be safer and would likely have a lower rate of people stopping taking their prescribed drug. Lower toxicity also means fewer medical appointments to get the dose right and fewer visits to monitor for side effects.' In a small trial, healthy adult volunteers were given a course of ebselen. They carried out a number of tests of brain function, provided blood samples and also went through an MRI scan . The results showed that ebselen had similar effects on the brain to lithium. The next stage will be a full clinical trial to test the effectiveness of ebselen as a treatment. The researchers have obtained funding from the Stanley Medical Research Institute in the United States to conduct a 'proof of concept' study for ebselen in patients with bipolar disorder. It is hoped that the study will start in later in 2016 Should these successes continue, ebselen will be one of only a few examples of a 'rescued drug', where a new use has been found for a failed drug compound. Dr Sridhar Vasudevan said: 'By rescuing a drug, we benefit from the earlier research and the work of the earlier researchers has a new value. Rather than remaining unused on the shelf of a pharmaceutical company or academic laboratory, drug compounds become available for other uses. 'Recently, there has been more focus on encouraging researchers to share these compounds so that others can find new uses for them. Even so, this is one of the first handful of examples of drug repurposing.' University of Oxford   press release Singh N et al.

This is reported by researchers from the University of Basel, who evaluated, for the first time, the plastic concentration at the surface of one of the big European rivers. Their results have been published in the journal Scientific Reports. Tiny plastic particles smaller than five millimeters, so-called microplastics, are found in almost all waterbodies these days. They occur as intermediate products in plastic production or as pellets for cleansing and care products or result from fragmentation of plastic debris. They are released into the environment due to improper handling. In the oceans, they contribute to the  great garbage patches  and are ingested by many organisms, from protozoa to baleen whales. Although as much as 80% of this marine plastic is emitted by rivers to the oceans, not a single great river has yet been scientifically studied for the microplastics load over its length. Environmental pollution mapped For the first time, environmental scientists from the University of Basel have now reported the abundance and composition of microplastics at the surface of the Rhine between Basel and Rotterdam. They took 31 water samples at 11 locations over a stretch of 820 kilometers. Microplastics were found in all samples in different concentrations, with an average of 892,777 particles per square kilometer (or 4,960 particles per 1000 cubic meters). The findings reflect the major potential sources of environmental pollution along the Rhine, such as metropolitan areas and industrial plants, waste water treatment plants and weirs, as well as the particular current conditions. The minimum average microplastics pollution was found in the stretch between Basel and Mainz (202,900 particles per square kilometer), a medium average at Bad Honnef, K ln-Porz and Leverkusen (714,053) and the highest average in the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area (2,333,665). A peak microplastics concentration was measured at Rees on the Nederhijn, where 3.9 million plastic items per square kilometer (or 21,839 particles per 1000 cubic meters) were found in a single water sample. 191 million particles a day  The Rhine's microplastics concentrations are thus among the highest so far studied worldwide , says biologist Professor Patricia Holm from the Department of Environmental Sciences at the University of Basel. For the most polluted Swiss lakes, Lake Geneva and Lake Maggiore, 220,000 particles per square kilometer were reported in other studies. As a further example, in Lake Erie in the U.S., only 105,503 items per square kilometer were found. Significantly less microplastics were also found in the river Rhone near Geneva. In general, extreme peaks may be reached after heavy rain or accidents.  Our results show that the Rhine is significantly polluted with microplastics , says Holm.  If we assume an average microplastics concentration on the day we took the water sample in Rees, we can say that the Rhine contributes a daily load of more than 191 million plastic particles to the North Sea, and that only takes into account the surface. Even though, in terms of weight, this only corresponds to roughly 25 to 30 kilos a day, this adds up to 10 tons a year. Each one of these billions of plastic items can be ingested by organisms and have negative effects on their health.  Origins partially unclear The scientists concentrated on the detection of microplastics found in large numbers in production worldwide and of low specific density, such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene. The types of plastics are used in the plastic industry e.g. for packaging, office equipment and vehicle construction and float on the water surface for long distances. Samples were mostly taken from boats of the Rhine Police Basel-Stadt and the Waterways and Shipping Administration in Germany and the Netherlands. The researchers found microplastics in the shape of opaque and transparent spherules as well as of fragments and fibers.  The extremely high proportion of more than 60 percent spherules in certain parts of the river is striking. Where they come from and what their former use was, is largely unclear so far , says Thomas Mani, first author of the study and PhD student at the Department of Environmental Sciences of the University of Basel.","Published: December 9, 2015"

The current study investigated mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis.  NRLP3 is one of several inflammasomes   multiprotein structures in disease-fighting white blood cells   the first of which was identified less than 15 years ago. The NRLP3 complex responds to microbes and other danger signals by activating molecules called cytokines, such as interleukin-1 beta, which trigger inflammation to fight infection,  said Nobel Laureate Dr. Bruce Beutler, Director of the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense at UT Southwestern and senior author of the study. The paper s lead author is Dr. Hexin Shi, a postdoctoral researcher in the Center, who identified the gene for the enzyme and then worked to characterize the enzyme s role as a new component of the inflammasome. The research effort marshaled a large team working under one of the National Institutes of Health s U19 grants, which are awarded for far-ranging, multidisciplinary research projects such as this one that involve genetics, immunology, physiology, and computational biology. The researchers genetically screened thousands of mice and conducted exhaustive interdisciplinary experiments: identifying a defect in inflammasome function, ascribing that defect to a mutation in the gene for the NEK7 enzyme, and fully characterizing NEK7 function in innate immunity. The enzyme was previously known only for its involvement in cell division, or mitosis, a process that involves the creation of two daughter cells from one parental cell. Specifically, mitosis is the phase of cell division in which the nucleus, which holds all of the cell s genetic material, divides to form two new cells, each with a full complement of genes.  Our work has shown that the inflammasome cannot become activated during mitosis. This is possibly a protective mechanism that prevents damage to DNA during this part of the cell cycle,  said Dr. Beutler, who shared the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his groundbreaking work on innate immunity.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/key-bacterial-component-resolved-199092,Key Bacterial Component Resolved A new study offers atomic level details of the molecular machinery that allows swimming bacteria to sense their environment and change direction when needed  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The study represents a major step in understanding the  bacterial brain,  said University of Illinois physics professor Klaus Schulten, who led the new research.  On its surface, a bacterium has thousands of receptors that scan the environment and then tell it what to do,  he said. This is very much like the sensory input that all animals must process. Of course, bacteria are single-celled organisms and don t have brains, he said. But they nonetheless manage to organize and  remember  sensory signals long enough to respond to them in a way that aids their own survival. The receptors on the surface of a bacterial cell detect light, chemicals, edible things and poisonous things, and transmit that information to a deeper layer of proteins, called kinases, which interpret this data and translate it into a simple choice:  Keep going  or  Change direction!  If the latter decision is made, a kinase hands off a potent chemical signal   a phosphate   to a second kinase, called CheY (KEY why), which then detaches, finds its way to the flagella and activates a process that causes the flagella to reverse their spin.  That makes the bacterium tumble and go in a new, random direction, which may be better than the previous direction,  Schulten said. Previous studies have yielded key insights into the structure of the molecular machine that orchestrates this feat, the chemosensory array. Electron microscopy of the inner and outer surfaces of bacterial cells gives some clues, and crystallography   a process that involves stacking purified proteins into crystals so that their three-dimensional characteristics can be measured   provides others. But the fuzzy resolution of the EM snapshots leaves a lot of room for interpretation, and the crystals can resolve only small portions of the array s constituent proteins. Study co-author, experimentalist Peijun Zhang of the University of Pittsburgh, aided this effort by developing a technique to purify the key proteins in the array and combine them in just the right proportions so that they assemble themselves in thin layers   allowing clearer 3-D EM snapshots of their structural conformations and interactions with each other. This vastly improved the resolution of the data. To resolve the picture of the chemosensory array, Schulten and his colleagues used molecular dynamic flexible fitting, a computer modeling approach Schulten s lab developed at Illinois. MDFF simulates the chemical interactions of every atom in a system and makes use of what is known about the structure from EM, crystallography and other experimental data. Such large-scale modeling and simulation requires the heft of a supercomputer, and for this effort the team used Blue Waters at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the U. of I. The new study revealed key chemical interactions between the proteins that make up the chemosensory array, and offered new insights into the behavior of these proteins. For example, it revealed for the first time that one region of a kinase called CheA (KEY aye), changes its orientation in relation to the other proteins, in a motion the researchers call  dipping.  Further experiments revealed that this part of the kinase is essential to the process that allows a bacterium to respond to its environment and change direction.  A big question in the field is: How does the signal pass from the receptors to the kinases? What is actually happening?  Schulten said.  It has to be a motion. It can t be anything else. But what kind of motion?  More work is needed to determine the relationships and behavior of all of the components of the system, but the new study represents a major gain in comprehension, Schulten said. He compares the process of discovery to that of someone encountering a mechanical clock for the first time.  To know how this mechanical system works, we need to know the structure,  he said.  Once we open the clock, see how the gears fit together, then we can start thinking about how the clock actually works. The gears of the bacterial brain are now in place.

They achieved this by integrating a conventional solid-state complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit with an artificial lipid bilayer membrane containing ATP-powered ion pumps, opening the door to creating entirely new artificial systems that contain both biological and solid-state components. The study, led by Ken Shepard, Lau Family Professor of Electrical Engineering and professor of biomedical engineering at Columbia Engineering, has been published recently.   In combining a biological electronic device with CMOS, we will be able to create new systems not possible with either technology alone,  says Shepard.  We are excited at the prospect of expanding the palette of active devices that will have new functions, such as harvesting energy from ATP, as was done here, or recognizing specific molecules, giving chips the potential to taste and smell. This was quite a unique new direction for us and it has great potential to give solid-state systems new capabilities with biological components.  Shepard, whose lab is a leader in the development of engineered solid-state systems interfaced to biological systems, notes that despite its overwhelming success, CMOS solid-state electronics is incapable of replicating certain functions natural to living systems, such as the senses of taste and smell and the use of biochemical energy sources. Living systems achieve this functionality with their own version of electronics based on lipid membranes and ion channels and pumps, which act as a kind of  biological transistor.  They use charge in the form of ions to carry energy and information ion channels control the flow of ions across cell membranes. Solid-state systems, such as those in computers and communication devices, use electrons; their electronic signaling and power are controlled by field-effect transistors. In living systems, energy is stored in potentials across lipid membranes, in this case created through the action of ion pumps. ATP is used to transport energy from where it is generated to where it is consumed in the cell. To build a prototype of their hybrid system, Shepard s team, led by PhD student Jared Roseman, packaged a CMOS integrated circuit (IC) with an ATP-harvesting  biocell.  In the presence of ATP, the system pumped ions across the membrane, producing an electrical potential harvested by the IC.  We made a macroscale version of this system, at the scale of several millimeters, to see if it worked,  Shepard notes.  Our results provide new insight into a generalized circuit model, enabling us to determine the conditions to maximize the efficiency of harnessing chemical energy through the action of these ion pumps. We will now be looking at how to scale the system down.  While other groups have harvested energy from living systems, Shepard and his team are exploring how to do this at the molecular level, isolating just the desired function and interfacing this with electronics.  We don t need the whole cell,  he explains.  We just grab the component of the cell that s doing what we want. For this project, we isolated the ATPases because they were the proteins that allowed us to extract energy from ATP.  The ability to build a system that combines the power of solid-state electronics with the capabilities of biological components has great promise.  You need a bomb-sniffing dog now, but if you can take just the part of the dog that is useful the molecules that are doing the sensing we wouldn t need the whole animal,  says Shepard.  With appropriate scaling, this technology could provide a power source for implanted systems in ATP-rich environments such as inside living cells,  added Roseman.","Published: December 9, 2015"

The tool can also determine which proteins were present at fertilization and which were later created by the embryo itself.  For the first time now we are able to decrypt the 'protein economy' of a developing embryo,  said Leonid Peshkin, HMS lecturer on systems biology. What s more, the researchers have arrived at a finding that runs contrary to a long-held assumption among many scientists, namely, that expression levels of messenger RNA in a cell can be used as a proxy for protein levels. At first this notion seems reasonable. If RNA produces protein, then high levels of RNA in a cell indicate high levels of protein, and vice versa. Peshkin and his team, however, discovered this assumption was, more often than not, the result of a false equivalency. When Peshkin considers the question of protein allocation in a developing embryo, he compares it to a dinner party. If you are inviting a large crowd, you don t want to prepare everything days ahead of time (no one likes salad that s been dressed for a week). Nor do you want to start all your food prep as people show up (especially when the roast needs to marinate for seven hours). Either extreme will result in wasted effort. The correct approach, obviously, is to balance advance preparation with those tasks that need to be done on the spot. The trick is determining that balance. It s the same for protein allocation. Some proteins are deposited into the embryo at the moment of fertilization, while others are produced on an as-needed basis as the embryo grows. For biologists, understanding the dynamics of this process is key to understanding the basic biology of development. Traditionally, researchers have used RNA expression levels to assess protein levels. Peshkin decided to test this approach. He and his colleagues identified 10,000 genes in the frog embryo and measured all of their subsequent protein levels throughout development using a mass spectrometer. They then compared these measurements to levels of RNA expression throughout the same period. Peshkin then repeated this experiment, this time measuring protein levels only at the moment of fertilization and excluding the protein quantities throughout development. He entered that data, including RNA expression levels, into a predictive algorithm. The algorithm crunched the information from these two data sets and then determined the protein quantities throughout each stage of early development. Peshkin found that if you use RNA expression alone as a proxy for protein quantity the long-held convention among researchers the results will be inaccurate most of the time, particularly in instances where proteins are rapidly created and quickly disposed of. His predictive algorithm, on the other hand, was accurate most of the time. To his surprise, he and his colleagues found that many proteins crucial for later organ function are stockpiled in the oocyte before it is even fertilized. The reason this was unexpected is that many of these proteins are tissue-specific and not only have no purpose in a fertilized egg, but can be toxic to the embryo if they are used too early. The next question that Peshkin will investigate is how the egg manages to keep these proteins in check. The paper briefly touches upon the role and dynamics of post-translational protein modifications, for example, phosphorylation, in embryonic development. But these observations are just the tip of the iceberg. This is often the case in biomedical research, he mused. New findings often lead to further questions.  It s something of joke around the lab,  he said.  All too often the headline is,  Unprecedentedly large data set reveals new depths of our ignorance in biology.  The tool is now available online for researchers to investigate their particular proteins of interest.","Published: December 9, 2015"

Many patients with epilepsy are not experiencing any improvements from existing drugs. Surgery can be an alternative for severe epilepsy, in case it is possible to localise and remove the epileptic focus in the brain where seizures arise. ""There is a period between the detection of this focus and the operation when the gene therapy alternative could be tested. If it works well, the patient can avoid surgery. If it doesn't, surgery will go ahead as initially planned and the affected part will then be removed. With this approach, the experimental treatment will be more secure for the patient"", says Professor Merab Kokaia. He and his group are working on a rat model that mimics temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common type of epilepsy. The test animals are given injections of the epilepsy-inducing substance, kainate, in the temporal lobe of one the cerebral hemispheres. Most of the animals had seizures of varying degrees, whereas some had no seizures, which Merab Kokaia considers a good result, as it is similar to the situation among people. Brain damage resulting from various accidents has very different consequences for different patients, as some develop epilepsy, whereas others do not. The rats that developed epilepsy were then given gene therapy in the part of the brain in which the kainate had been injected, and where the seizures arose. Genes were delivered for both the signal substance (neuropeptide Y) and one of its receptors. The idea was that the combination would create a larger effect than only delivering the gene for the signal substance itself. Neuropeptide Y can bind to several different receptors and in the worst case it binds to a receptor that promotes increase in the number of seizures instead of decrease. The study results have so far been positive. The increase in the frequency of seizures that has been seen among the control animals that were treated with inactive genes was halted after the treatment with combination of active genes, and for 80 % of the animals the number of seizures was reduced by almost half. ""The test must be repeated in more animal studies, so that the possible side effects, on memory for example, can be studied. But, we regard this study as promising proof of concept, a demonstration that the method works,"" states Merab Kokaia. He expects that the first gene therapy treatments will be carried out on patients who have already been selected for surgical procedures. In the long term, however, gene therapy will be of the greatest benefit to those patients who cannot be operated on. There are patients with severe epilepsy whose epileptic focus is so badly placed that an operation is out of question since it can impair e.g. speech or movement. These patients can therefore never undergo a surgical procedure, but could be helped by gene therapy in the future.","Published: December 9, 2015"

The trial of the novel therapy, which involves genetically engineering the patient s white blood cells so that they recognize and attack the tumour, is taking place at the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) at Guy s and St Thomas  and King s College London, with funding from the Wellcome Trust and the J P Moulton Charitable Foundation. Dr John Maher, Principal Investigator at the BRC, says:  In most cancers, metastasis, the spread of a disease from the part of the body where it started to another not directly connected, is the commonest cause of death. However, head and neck cancer is unusual in that local spread or recurrence of the disease accounts for most suffering and death. This means that tumours may become inoperable and do not shrink in response to traditional treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy.  White blood cells of the immune system are naturally equipped to eliminate cells that shouldn t be there, especially infected cells. However, they sometimes need help to recognize and attack cancer cells. Using a blood sample, Dr Maher s team are genetically engineering the patients  own white blood cells by treating them in the laboratory with a harmless virus that introduces two new genes. The first gene makes it easier to grow the cells during their time in the laboratory while the second enables these white blood cells to recognize and attack the tumour. The resulting treatment is called a CAR T-cell and takes two weeks to produce. To maximize the safety and effectiveness of this new form of treatment, they are injecting the CAR T-cells directly into the tumour. CAR T-cell treatment has proven very effective in some forms of leukaemia but needs to be tested and developed further to benefit patients with solid cancers, such as head and neck cancer. The main goal of the trial is to test the safety and effectiveness of this new treatment. Patients have been enrolled in groups of three and, if significant side effects are not seen, successive groups will receive a higher number of cells to establish safe dosage. So far the team has completed the first cohort of three patients in this ongoing trial. Dr Maher adds:  If this trial is successful, it could have significant implications for other solid cancers, especially those that spread within a natural space in the body, such as ovarian cancer (lining of the abdomen) or mesothelioma (lining of the lungs). In that setting, it may be possible to inject the CAR T-cells from the patient directly into the cavity, to localise the treatment where it is needed most.  Life Sciences Minister George Freeman MP said:  This world first trial is an illustration of the value of our  1bn per annum National Institute for Health Research, which pioneers and tests new treatments for the benefits of patients and the NHS. Through our Accelerated Access Review, we intend to fast track breakthroughs like this.  Dr Stephen Caddick, Director of Innovations at the Wellcome Trust, said:  Immunotherapy is a very exciting new approach to treating cancer, which takes advantage of the body s own immune system to tackle the disease. By precision engineering immune cells to recognize and destroy tumours, researchers are hopeful that they will be able to improve the prospects for patients who have, until now, faced very limited treatment options.

The researchers published the genome map of the African turquoise killifish along with early insights into the genetic determinants of its life span. Using a statistical analysis that looks at mutation rates across different organisms, the scientists found evidence that some of the same rare genes that have persisted in the killifish gene pool over centuries have also persisted in the gene pools of some unusually long-lived animals. The researchers wonder if this means there are certain genes that evolution has  tuned  to create varying life spans.  The range of life spans seen in nature is truly astonishing, and really we have very little insight into how this has evolved or how this works,  said Anne Brunet, PhD, professor of genetics at Stanford and senior author of the study.  By having the genome of this fish and comparing it to other species, we start seeing differences that could underlie life span differences both between species and also within a species.  The study s lead author is Dario Valenzano, PhD, a former postdoctoral scholar in Brunet s lab who now directs his own lab at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Aging. Life in the fast lane Evolved to both hatch and reproduce within the brief rainy seasons in Mozambique and Zimbabwe, the turquoise killifish has an extremely compressed life cycle. Brunet said she and her team believed that once the fish s genes were mapped out, they would provide an  exciting new opportunity to use an evolutionary lens to propose ideas about aging.  Brunet and members of her lab have worked for the past nine years to establish a colony of killifish at Stanford and to create online access to killifish gene maps for other researchers who want to study them. They hope that studying the killifish, some strains of which live only four to six months, will help them investigate why some species, like this fish, live less than a year, whereas others, like some whales, can live 200. They also hope the research will provide insights into longevity differences among humans.  Using a range of genomic and genetic techniques, team members sequenced small segments of killifish DNA and then used specialized software to string these sequences together until they had assembled a full digital map of the turquoise killifish genome. They repeated this process in different strains of the fish to identify important genetic variations within the species.  Once you have the genome, it really breaks open the possibility of using genetic manipulation experiments and more conceptual comparative genomics studies,  Brunet said. Brunet and her colleagues have already begun to examine genes that are unique to the short-lived killifish, as well as to cross-breed short-lived killifish with a longer-lived strain to look for genes tied to longevity. When they mated long-lived fish with short-lived fish, they observed a cluster of genes shared between the long-lived grandparents and the long-lived grandchildren. They noted that several genes in this cluster are associated with longevity and aging in other species. One of these genes is the killifish equivalent of a human gene whose mutation is associated with frontotemporal dementia, a disease that generally manifests in late adulthood. The researchers see this as another good sign that analyses of killifish genes can set the stage for important health discoveries about human biology.  We don t know yet exactly how these findings are relevant to humans, but these are questions we are actively pursuing,  Brunet said. A community resource Brunet said she and her colleagues were eager to establish the killifish as a model organism not only for their own future studies but for the research community. As they worked to assemble the killifish genome, they also built a user-friendly website that other researchers can access for free.  They can go to our website, enter their favorite gene of interest and then zoom in on the killifish equivalent,  she said. The paper was published alongside another killifish genome paper by a German team in the same issue ofCell. Brunet said she is excited that other researchers have begun working with killifish and hopes the resources published by both teams will usher in a new level of emphasis on the animal as a model for longevity research.  Having the genome transforms a nice, interesting organism into a model organism,  she said.","Published: December 9, 2015"

While Whole Genome Sequencing has been previously used in TB research studies, this is the first time the technology was applied in real world scenarios. The researchers at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital were able to detect presence of TB and whether it was resistant to commonly used antibiotics within one week   up to eight times faster than utilising traditional diagnosis methods. In addition to facilitating faster and more targeted treatment of people with TB, the speedy diagnosis also meant the scientists were able to detect and respond to potential outbreaks as they happen. The innovative technology also proved more cost effective, at an average cost of  481 per positive case, compared to  517 per case using current technologies. The stunning results of this trial have implications for TB prevention in the UK. It was funded by the Health Innovation Challenge Fund (HIC Fund) and supported by the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centreand the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance. The new technique will be adopted by Public Health England (PHE) and is expected to reduce transmission of TB. Tuberculosis is a major part of PHE's strategy for infectious diseases due to some increases in incidence and emergence of multi-drug resistant infections. PHE is also working with Genomics England as part of the 100,000 Genomes Project to further understanding of why some people develop severe reactions to infections. Lead author Dr Louise Pankhurst, University of Oxford, said: 'This is a really exciting time to be working in infectious disease research. The UK is poised to become the first country in the world to replace traditional tuberculosis diagnosis with whole genome sequencing. Our study has shown how this will dramatically speed up the time taken to diagnose TB, helping patients be placed on the most effective treatment as soon as possible and reducing the risk of disease transmission.' Professor Derrick Crook, Director of the Public Health England National Infections Service said: 'This ground-breaking research provides a roadmap for faster, cheaper and more effective diagnosis of TB, and is a crucial step in Public Health England s goal of eliminating TB as a public health problem in England. 'This marks a significant milestone in the way we tackle TB, yet things are going to get better as whole genome sequencing technology is rapidly becoming much faster and less expensive and will ultimately inform the way we deal routinely with all infectious disease diagnosis.'","Published: December 9, 2015"

Based on gentle acoustic vibrations, the device, called acoustic tweezers, is the work of Penn State professor of engineering science and mechanics,Tony Huang and his students.  ""We believe our acoustic tweezers have tremendous potential, especially in diagnostics, with some applications also in therapeutics,"" Huang said. ""Our current device works well, but to be used in diagnostics, the whole device has to be disposed of after one use. We have now found a way to separate the fluid-containing part of the device from the much more expensive ultrasound-producing piezoelectric substrate. This makes disposable acoustic tweezers possible."" Huang believes that the disposable plastic portion of the device can be manufactured for as little as 25 cents per unit. Even with the addition of electronics for diagnosis, which could be easily added off the shelf, he foresees a manufacturing cost of a few dollars for the complete permanent system, which could then be used over and over with the simple replacement of the plastic microfluidic channels. ""We want to push this toward a commercial product, something that can help people and benefit society,"" Huang said. In the prior device, the microfluidic channel was permanently bound to the substrate and the ultrasound would be radiated directly into the fluid. In the new device, there is an intervening layer, but the ultrasound force is strong enough to manipulate the cells and to pattern them. This patterning of cells is especially important in studying cell-to-cell communication in biology labs or for drug screening. ""In drug screening, you want to examine how cells respond to drugs. With our acoustic tweezers, we can create a high throughput of single cells and see how they respond to drugs. Or, we create all types of cell assemblies and see how they respond to drugs, much more like how it would work inside the body,"" said Feng Guo, a Ph.D. student in Huang's group and lead author of the paper ""Reusable acoustic tweezers for disposable devices."" In addition to its use in diagnosing diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis, both of which are endemic in resource-poor regions of the world, the device should find widespread use in hospitals, clinics, biology labs and the home due to its low cost and ease of use.","Published: December 9, 2015"

That knowledge and the cloaking proteins themselves might now be turned against the toxin the deadliest known to humankind to deliver vaccines or drugs that could prevent or treat the disease.  The key discovery was made by deciphering the atomic-scale structure of one form of the toxin bound to an associated protein. To determine these structures, the scientists studied crystallized samples of the bound toxin using x-rays at Brookhaven's National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), a DOE Office of Science User Facility, and electron microscopy. Though there are seven different types of botulinum toxin, all are released from Clostridium botulinumbacteria as a complex of the toxin plus at least one such associated protein. When people eat contaminated food, the toxin/associated-protein complex stays together in the digestive system, but splits apart to free the toxin once it moves into the bloodstream, where it goes on to disable nerve cells, causing paralysis and death.  ""We wanted to know how the toxin is protected, how the complex stays together in the harsh acidic environment of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and how the toxin comes out once it leaves the GI tract and enters the bloodstream,"" said Brookhaven Lab biologist Subramanyam Swaminathan, lead author on the paper.  The atomic-scale structures reveal the detailed mechanism of how the toxin/associated-protein complex is assembled and stays intact under acidic conditions, and also how it disassociates when it enters the neutral pH conditions of the blood.  ""As the pH changes to neutral, some of the acidic amino acids at the interface between the two proteins the toxin and the associated protein become negatively charged. The repulsion between the negative charges causes the toxin and the associated protein to separate, leading to the dissolution of the complex and the emergence of the active toxin,"" Swaminathan said.  The structures also revealed a strong similarity with one of the complexes formed by another botulinum neurotoxin, suggesting that there may be common elements across all seven varieties in the complex stage.  ""The active versions of the toxins have quite different structures,"" Swaminathan said. ""So finding any similarities among the seven varieties could help simplify the search for strategies to combat the toxin."" One promising approach, the scientists say, would be to use the toxin's own cloaking system to develop vaccines or drugs. For example, the cloaking proteins might be used to deliver inactive forms of the toxin that could trigger a protective immune response in the bloodstream in other words an easily administered oral vaccine.  The cloaking proteins might even be able to deliver a drug that could disable the toxin before it has a chance to exert its deadly effects. This would provide an antidote to a deadly toxin that currently has limited treatments. New treatments would certainly help mitigate the fears of home food canners not to mention those concerned that botulinum neurotoxin might be used as a weapon of bioterror.","Published: December 9, 2015"

Influenza vaccines have been developed to prevent the yearly outbreaks of this respiratory illness and to protect people at risk from developing severe disease. In contrast to many other vaccines, influenza vaccines need to be reformulated each year because circulating influenza viruses continuously evolve. This evolution is due to the ability of viruses to accumulate new mutations in their genome. Especially critical are those genomic regions that encode viral proteins recognized by the human immune system. World Health Organization (WHO) is responsible for predicting the influenza strains that will be most common during the next season and for giving recommendations on the particular virus strains that should be used for producing the vaccines for the next influenza season. The effectiveness of the vaccines varies from year to year and was modest for the previous season. This could be due to antigenic mismatch between the circulating influenza viruses and the vaccine strains recommended by the WHO. Researchers from the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, FIMM, the University of Helsinki, have now analysed thousands of complete genome sequences of influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) strains representing different geographic regions. The study was done in collaboration with researchers from Singapore and United Kingdom. By utilizing biostatistical methods, the team was able to identify several genetic variants that changed the structure of the influenza proteins and that were present in surprisingly many of the strains studied. -  We named these characteristic variants as evolutionary markers as they seemed to contain valuable information regarding the viral evolution, explains Denis Kainov, the leader of the research team. Furthermore, the group was able to show that both influenza subtypes acquired their own sets of these evolutionary markers. Importantly, many of these markers were not present in the virus strains used for the vaccine development during the last season. - We believe that our results and methodology could further improve vaccine strain selection process and, thereby, enhance vaccine efficacy. Each year a substantial number of Finns gets influenza. We estimated that if the vaccination efficacy increases by 50%, this would save up to 8 000 people from getting the disease in Finland alone. Our team proposes using the strains containing all the identified evolutionary markers as vaccine candidates for upcoming influenza seasons, Kainov continues.","Published: December 9, 2015"

But because tumor cells may metastasize at different times and the rate of spread is difficult to assess, the relationship between tumor size and the relative risk of recurrence after surgery is challenging to calculate. Writing in the journal Cancer Research, scientists at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) and Inria, the French National Institute for computer science and applied mathematics in Bordeaux, France, demonstrate that mathematical models can provide useful clues about the impact of surgery on metastasis and may help to predict the risk of cancer spread. The scientists generated a mathematical model using the key parameters of primary tumor size and metastatic spread based on data generated from laboratory models designed to mimic cancer s progression in humans. They used tumor cells engineered to express a luminescent marker, allowing for the tracking and quantification of these otherwise-undetectable cancer cells. The mathematical modeling confirmed a strong dependence between presurgical primary tumor size and postsurgical metastatic growth and survival. However, some surprising developments were noted.  We found that this relationship was not simply dependent on size,  says the study s corresponding author,Sebastien Benzekry, PhD, a Research Scientist on the Modeling in ONCology (MONC) team at the Inria Bordeaux Research Center, which is affiliated with the Institute of Mathematics of Bordeaux (University of Bordeaux).  The models indicate that in the case of tumors that are either very large or very small, tumor size does not significantly impact on survival, and therefore loses its predictive value. This, in turn, could impact how treatment decisions, such as the optimal time to start and stop therapy, are made.  Recent advances allowed the research team to, for the first time, integrate data-based mathematical models for predicting post-surgery disease growth patterns into preclinical animal models.  These findings represent a novel use of clinically relevant models to assess the impact of surgery on metastatic potential, and may guide the optimal timing of treatments in both the presurgical and postsurgical settings to maximize patient benefit,  notes the study s senior author, John Ebos, PhD, Assistant Professor of Oncology in the departments of Cancer Genetics and Medicine at Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, N.Y.

Disruption or loss of some microRNAs has been linked to cancer, raising the possibility of treating tumors by adjusting microRNA levels. Developing such treatments requires delivering microRNA to tumors, which has proven difficult. However, researchers from MIT have now shown that by twisting RNA strands into a triple helix and embedding them in a biocompatible gel, they can not only deliver the strands efficiently but also use them to shrink aggressive tumors in mice. Using this technique, the researchers dramatically improved cancer survival rates by simultaneously turning on a tumor-suppressing microRNA and de-activating one that causes cancer. They believe their approach could also be used for delivering other types of RNA, as well as DNA and other therapeutic molecules.  This is a platform that can deliver any gene of interest,  says Natalie Artzi, a research scientist in MIT s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) and an assistant professor of medicine at Brigham and Women s Hospital.  This work demonstrates the promise of local delivery in combating cancer. In particular, as relates to gene therapy, the triplex structure improves RNA stability, uptake, and transfection efficacy.  Artzi is the senior author of a paper describing the technique and the study s lead author is IMES postdoc Jo o Conde. Local delivery The new technique reflects a shift among cancer researchers toward designing more targeted and selective treatments, Artzi says.  Cancer is perceived as a systemic disease that mandates systemic treatment. However, in some cases, solid tumors can benefit from a local therapy that may include gene therapy or chemotherapy,  she says. To create their new system, the researchers took advantage of a material previously developed by Artzi and her colleagues, made from two polymers known as dextran and dendrimer, as a tissue glue. In the new study, Artzi and Conde exploited the ability of dendrimer to form a self-assembled structure with the microRNAs of interest. First, they wound three strands of microRNA together in a triple helix, creating a molecule that is much more stable than a single or double RNA strand. These triplexes then bind to dendrimer molecules, some of which form nanoparticles, and when dextran is added the injectable formulation gels on top of the solid tumor. Once placed on the tumor, the gel slowly releases microRNA-dendrimer particles, which are absorbed into the tumor cells. After the particles enter the cells, enzymes cut each triple helix into three separate microRNA strands. MicroRNA alters gene expression by disrupting messenger RNA molecules, which carry DNA s instructions to cells  protein-building machinery. The human genome is believed to encode more than 1,000 microRNAs, and many of these can cause disease when not working properly. In this study, the researchers delivered two targeted microRNA sequences, plus a third strand whose only function is to keep the helix stable. One of the strands mimics the actions of a naturally occurring microRNA called miR-205, which is frequently silenced in cancer cells. The other blocks a microRNA called miR-221, which is often overactive in cancer cells. The researchers tested the microRNA delivery platform in mice implanted with triple-negative breast tumors, which lack the three most common breast cancer markers: estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Her2. Such tumors are usually very difficult to treat. Treating these mice with microRNA delivered as a triple helix was far more effective than standard chemotherapy treatments, the researchers found. With the triple helix treatment, tumors shrank 90 percent and the mice survived for up to 75 days, compared with less than a week for other treatments (including single and double strands of the same microRNAs). The microRNA combination used in this study appears to work by interfering with cancer cells  ability to grow and to stick to other cells, the researchers found.  This is a great proof of principle,  says Mauro Ferrari, the president and CEO of the Houston Methodist Research Institute, who was not involved in the study.  In many ways microRNA is the ultimate opportunity for targeted cancer therapy, but the problem of delivering it has been intractable.  Identifying targets Artzi and Conde now plan to look for combinations of microRNA that could combat other types of tumors. This delivery technique will likely work best with accessible solid tumors, such as breast, colon, and possibly brain tumors, Artzi says. This type of microRNA therapy could also be used to prevent tumors from spreading throughout the body. Several microRNA sequences have already been found to play a role in this process, known as metastasis.  There are so many microRNAs that are involved in metastasis. It s really an underexplored field,  Conde says. The researchers are also looking into using this technique for delivering other types of nucleic acids, including short interfering RNA for RNA interference and DNA for gene therapy.  We really want to identify the right targets and use this platform to deliver them in a very effective way,  Artzi says.","Published: December 9, 2015"

Now the results of new research, described in the journal Nature Neuroscience, have identified brain processes in mice that may help explain how those differences happen.  In everyday life, we experience weak stimuli all the time,  says senior researcher Daniel O Connor, PhD, assistant professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  Did I hear my name being called? Do you smell smoke? Is that an oasis up ahead or a mirage? When the brain receives weak information through the senses, it can interpret that information in multiple ways, and we wanted to understand what determines the resulting perception.  To find out, O Connor and his team used a simple model: the gentle tickling of a single mouse whisker, a sensory organ common to many animals.  The stimulation is faint enough that sometimes the mice perceive it, and sometimes they don t,  explains O Connor.  Why is that?  To get at the answer, the researchers had to train the mice to indicate when they felt tickled. First, they positioned the mice close to a waterspout. After they tickled a whisker, they gave the mouse a  reward,  a bit of water from the spout. If they didn t tickle a whisker, no water. So the mice learned to only lick the spout after perceiving a whisker tickle. Using high-resolution microscopy with an engineered protein that fluoresces when a nerve cell is active, O Connor s team members monitored the activity of hundreds of neurons in the part of the brain responsible for feeling touch. They then paired that data with the animals  licking responses. Studies in primates already had shown that activity in the primary sensory areas of the brain s cerebral cortex lines up with perception, and they found this to be true in the mice too. When the mice correctly perceived a tickle and licked the spout ( hits ), there were higher levels of activity in the cortex than when they didn t perceive a tickle ( misses ).  The cortex s response to exactly the same stimulus wasn t always the same, but it correlated with the animals  licking,  says O Connor. So why the difference in response when the stimulation is the same? The researchers began searching for that answer by monitoring the activity of the neurons that connect to individual whiskers. Those neurons turned out to respond equally to all tickles, whether the mice perceived them or not. After those first neurons fire in response to a tickle, however, the signal travels to the brainstem and then on to another part of the brain, the thalamus. So the research team repeated its activity monitoring there and saw a small, brief increase in neuron activity strength during the hit trials. The team thought the response seemed too small and brief to be responsible for the larger, longer hit signals seen in the cortex, though. To get a clearer picture of the relationship between the two signaling patterns, the scientists used a beam of light to artificially enhance the signals sent from the thalamus to the cortex, but even strong light produced only weak activity peaks in the cortex and didn t help the mice perceive whisker tickles. Finally, they returned to the cortex to look for the cause of the variability. Their previous experiments had focused on the primary sensory area of the cortex (S1). Deeper into the brain, however, is another set of neurons involved in  higher  aspects of perception, cognition and memory (S2). When the scientists monitored activity sent  backward  from these S2 neurons to those in S1, they saw patterns that did indeed predict and align with an animal s perception.  That implies,  says O Connor,  that the activity in S1 is being shaped by S2, a finding that adds cellular details to our understanding from psychology that what we perceive is not a fixed thing based only on sensory input but is influenced by our prior experiences and the current state of our brain.  O Connor says far more research is needed to determine what precisely accounts for the differences in S2 signaling. He expects that a  host  of factors will be identified, including memories and what the brain is paying attention to.Johns Hopkins Medicine   press release Yang H et al.

According to a report presented today at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology annual meeting in Hollywood, Florida, delay discounting is strongly influenced by our genetic makeup. That is, it is a trait that can be inherited. Identifying the 'delay discounting' genes, and the proteins they code for, will be important for understanding the basis of a variety of psychiatric disorders, especially addictions and other disorders that involve impulsive decision-making. In a study of 602 twins, Dr. Andrey Anokhin and his colleagues at Washington University School of Medicine found that delay discounting gradually improves as teens get older, such that 18 year-olds have a greater ability or tendency to wait for the larger delayed reward, as compared to younger teens. Apart from age, genes accounted for about half of the difference among individuals in their level of delay discounting. Many genes are likely to influence delay discounting; and some of Dr. Ahokhin's preliminary data suggest that these 'impulsivity genes' may include genes coding for enzymes that synthesize the neurotransmitter serotonin and receptors where serotonin binds in the brain. While it is tantalizing to speculate that the associations between delay discounting and serotonin-related genes may ultimately point the way to new treatments for addictions and other disorders involving impulsive choice, Dr. Anokhin cautions that ""it is very early to link this speculation to a clinical application."" Ongoing studies by investigators across the country, including Drs. Abraham Palmer and James MacKillop, who also participated in today's conference, involve analysis of DNA and questionnaire responses from as many as 25,000 human subjects in order to identify specific genes involved in delay discounting. These studies offer to further our understanding of a behavioral trait that can have profound effects on daily life and psychiatric well-being.

A hallmark of severe mental illness, psychosis is marked by hallucinations and delusions, or false, irrational beliefs. ""The biotypes were more biologically homogeneous than categories based on observable symptoms,"" explained Bruce Cuthbert, PhD, acting director of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which funded the study. ""Just as fever or infection can have many different causes, multiple psychosis-causing disease processes operating via different biological pathways can lead to similar symptoms, confounding the search for better care."" The results lend support to the institute's Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDoC) initiative, which frees scientists from designing research based on traditional diagnostic categories, encouraging them to explore groupings based on genomics, behavioral dimensions, physiological traits, or brain imaging findings. More precise diagnosis is expected to lead to improved treatments. NIMH-funded researchers Carol Tamminga, MD, of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas; Brett Clementz, PhD, of the University of Georgia, Athens; and colleagues at other research centers, report on their multi-site study  in the American Journal of Psychiatry. The new findings come from a project called The Bipolar Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (BSNIP). They add to increasing evidence of biological overlap between traditional, symptom-based diagnostic categories for disorders in which patients experience psychotic symptoms. The BSNIP study used sophisticated statistical approaches to sort such cases into homogeneous subgroups, based on multiple neurobiological measures and levels of analysis. Color coding illustrates the relationship between biotypes and diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and psychotic bipolar disorder in study participants. Each disorder includes patients with each of the three biotypes. The biotypes vary along two key dimensions: cognitive control and sensorimotor reactivity. Credit B.Clementz, PhD, University of Georgia  The researchers examined key biological and behavioral measures linked to psychosis in 1,872 participants patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder with psychosis, their first-degree relatives and healthy control subjects. Measures such as performance on thinking, planning and memory tasks, eye-tracking, inhibition, and brainwave responses to auditory stimuli identified sets of biomarkers that differentiated subgroups of patients. Three distinct psychosis-related biotypes emerged that cut across clinical diagnosis boundaries. These subsets of biomarkers differentiated groupings of psychosis cases from each other considerably better than did traditional clinical diagnoses. External measures social functioning, brain structure, and rates of psychosis-related illness and biomarker patterns in patients' first-degree relatives also validated the neurobiological distinctiveness of the biotype subgroups more than they did the distinctiveness of symptom-based categories. People with different biotypes differed in their mix of psychosis-related impairments. For example, cases classified as Biotype 1 showed the most severe impairment in a set of brain functions that the researchers distilled into a construct they call ""cognitive control"" - the ability to flexibly exert control over attention and information processing to meet one's goals. Biotype 1 cases were also the most socially impaired. Biotype 2 cases showed intermediate levels of impaired cognitive control, but had normal to accentuated brain responses to sensory inputs and fast visual orienting, a set of brain functions called ""sensorimotor reactivity"" - the ability to detect and process sensory stimuli. Those classified as Biotype 3 showed normal cognitive control, modestly impaired sensorimotor reactivity, were the least socially impaired and had the lowest positive (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) and negative (e.g., blunted emotion) symptoms. Each biotype overlapped with the traditional diagnostic categories. For example, among Biotype 1 cases, 59 percent had a schizophrenia diagnosis, while among Biotype 3 cases 44 percent had a bipolar disorder with psychosis diagnosis.. Among Biotype 3 cases, 32 percent had schizophrenia, and among Biotype 1 cases, 20 percent had bipolar disorder with psychosis.

RIGHT: Psychosis cases similarly graphed by biomarker constructs show much less distinct clusters when grouped by the traditional diagnostic categories schizophrenia (sz), schizoaffective disorder (SZaff), and bipolar disorder with psychosis (BDP). Credit B.Clementz, PhD, University of Georgia  Differences in brain structure also distinguish the three biotypes, further validating the categorizations. On brain MRI scans, Biotype 1 cases - and to a lesser degree Biotype 2 cases - showed reduced gray matter, the brain's working tissue, across several areas of the cortex, or outer mantle, known to process higher-order information. By contrast, in Biotype 3 cases, the largest of the groups, such reduced gray matter was mostly localized in emotion-processing areas in deeper brain regions. No brain structural differences distinguished the traditional categories of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder from each other. Unaffected first-degree relatives of psychosis cases tended to show similar, but reduced, abnormalities in cognitive control, sensorimotor reactivity, social functioning and brain structure, suggesting that they may harbor ""constitutional"" risk factors for the biotypes. The different patterns of biomarkers across the biotypes may help to explain discrepancies in replicating biomarker studies across different clinical research centers, say the researchers. For example, since they tend to be the most compromised, Biotype 1 cases are more likely to be recruited in inpatient settings, while Biotype 2 and -3 cases are more likely to be found in outpatient settings. So even if patients have the same nominal diagnosis, they might tend to have different underlying illness processes. Similarly, researchers with mostly Biotype 3 cases might conclude that not much can be learned from studying first-degree relatives (their relatives were largely normal on the biomarkers) and/or that a large portion of the genetic risk for psychosis comes from spontaneous mutations. ""The biotypes outcome provides proof-of-concept that structural and functional brain biomarker measures can sort individuals with psychosis into groups that are neurobiologically distinctive and appear biologically meaningful,"" said Dr. Tamminga. The new findings suggest several leads for future research, say the investigators. Biotypes 1 and 2 may lend themselves to genetic studies, while Biotype 3 cases may yield more leads on environmental contributions to psychosis risk. Treatments for Biotype 1 should target cognitive control and enhance brain mechanisms for discerning the relevance of environmental stimuli. Cases with Biotypes 1 and 2 might be good candidates for treatments that correct neuronal activity levels through effects on cellular potassium or calcium channels.

The risk factors and causes of SUDEP remain unclear but researchers have proposed explanations ranging from irregular heart rhythm to genetic predisposition to accidental suffocation during sleep. Three studies to be presented at the American Epilepsy Society's (AES) 69th Annual Meeting (Dec. 4-8 in Philadelphia, PA, USA) parse the contributions of genetics to SUDEP in hopes of uncovering new strategies for prevention. Researchers from the Universities of Melbourne and Sydney report (abstract 3.339|C.01) that genetic variants associated with cardiac sudden death may be to blame for SUDEP. The authors examined DNA samples from 62 people who died from SUDEP, searching for mutations in genes known to contribute to cardiac arrhythmia, respiratory function and epilepsy. Their results reveal that nearly a quarter of people who experienced SUDEP carried mutations linked to cardiac sudden death, suggesting that irregular heart rhythms may underlie a significant number of deaths in epilepsy. Furthermore, one-quarter of the cases had genetic mutations associated with epilepsy. ""These findings raise the possibility that SUDEP might be prevented in some cases by avoiding the use of anti-epileptic drugs known to alter the heart's electrical activity"" says Douglas Crompton, MD, PhD, a neurologist at the University of Melbourne. ""In some cases, it may be advisable to recommend beta blockers, pacemakers or implantable defibrillators."" In a second study, (abstract 2.348) researchers from New York University (NYU)'s Langone Medical Center find that genetic mutations altering the transmission of electrical impulses in the heart and brain may raise the risk of SUDEP in people. The authors searched for genetic mutations that might explain the disproportionately high risk of SUDEP in people with poorly controlled focal epilepsy, which, by definition stems from a specific area of the brain. To identify genetic risk factors for SUDEP, the authors analyzed brain tissue that had been removed during epilepsy surgery from 8 people who later experienced SUDEP and from seven living people with similar histories. The study found mutations in 607 genes in brain tissue from patients who died from SUDEP that were not seen in the tissue from the living people. Analysis of affected genes revealed possible functional effects from 532 of the mutations. Three of people who experienced SUDEP had mutations in six genes linked to cardiac arrhythmia. The other five people who died from SUDEP had mutations in seven genes involved in GABA/Glutamate pathways. ""Genetic testing for these mutations could potentially allow for the early identification of people with epilepsy who are at high risk of sudden death,"" notes author Daniel Friedman, MD, an assistant professor of neurology at NYU. A third study (abstract 2.052|A.08) pinpoints a specific genetic mutation that may raise the risk of SUDEP in patients with early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy a severe, drug-resistant disorder that manifests in the first 3 months of life. Researchers from the University of Michigan set out to explore whether genetic mutations in voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSCs), which promote the transmission of electrical impulses in the heart and brain, increase the risk of SUDEP in patients with early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy. The authors reproduced this disorder in mice to explore whether mutations in a particular VGSC, encoded by the SCN8A gene, increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia, which might, in turn, influence susceptibility to SUDEP. Animal experiments revealed that mice carrying a mutated SCN8A gene had reduced heart rate compared with their healthy littermates, and that administration of caffeine produced an abnormal heart rhythm known as accelerated idioventricular rhythm. Examination of cardiac cells revealed a number of molecular changes that further altered the heart rhythm. ""Taken together, our results suggest that SCN8A mutations in people with early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy may increase the risk of SUDEP by creating an environment in which the heart has a higher susceptibility to arrhythmias,"" explains author Chad Frasier, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/modified-mosquitoes-could-help-fight-against-malaria-201253,Modified Mosquitoes Could Help Fight Against Malaria The results are published in the journal Nature Biotechnology  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. For the first time, malarial mosquitoes have been modified to be infertile and pass on the trait rapidly   raising the possibility of reducing the spread of disease. The mosquito species Anopheles gambiae is a major carrier of dangerous malaria parasites in sub-Saharan Africa, where 90 per cent of annual malaria deaths occur. Malaria infects more than 200 million people each year and causes more than 430,000 deaths. Now, a team of researchers led by Imperial College London have genetically modified Anopheles gambiae so that they carry a modified gene disrupting egg production in female mosquitoes. They used a technology called  gene drive  to ensure the gene is passed down at an accelerated rate to offspring, spreading the gene through a population over time. Within a few years, the spread could drastically reduce or eliminate local populations of the malaria-carrying mosquito species. Their findings represent an important step forward in the ability to develop novel methods of vector control. Normally, each gene variant has a 50 per cent chance of being passed down from parents to their offspring. In the Imperial team s experiments with Anopheles gambiae, the gene for infertility was transmitted to more than 90 per cent of both male and female mosquitoes  offspring. The technique uses recessive genes, so that many mosquitoes will inherit only one copy of the gene. Two copies are needed to cause infertility, meaning that mosquitoes with only one copy are carriers, and can spread the gene through a population. This is the first time the technique has been demonstrated in Anopheles gambiae. The team targeted three different fertility genes and tested each for their suitability for affecting a mosquito population through gene drive, demonstrating the strength and flexibility of the technique to be applied to a range of genes.  The field has been trying to tackle malaria for more than 100 years. If successful, this technology has the potential to substantially reduce the transmission of malaria,  said co-author Professor Andrea Crisanti from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial.  As with any new technology, there are many more steps we will go through to test and ensure the safety of the approach we are pursuing. It will be at least 10 more years before gene drive malaria mosquitos could be a working intervention,  added Professor Austin Burt from Imperial s Department of Life Sciences. Many current measures to control malaria rely on reducing populations of malarial mosquitoes, such as insecticides and bed nets. These have proven very successful in reducing the spread of malaria, however these approaches face important costs and distribution challenges, as well as growing issues of resistance. A control measure relying on genetic spread through a targeted population of malaria mosquitoes could complement these interventions without adding dramatically to the health budget of resource-constrained countries.  There are roughly 3,400 different species of mosquitoes worldwide, and while Anopheles gambiae is an important carrier of malaria, it is only one of around 800 species of mosquito in Africa, so suppressing it in certain areas should not significantly impact the local ecosystem,  said lead author Dr Tony Nolan from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial. To test the gene drive, the team first identified three genes that impacted female fertility by disrupting the activity of suspected target genes. They then modified the genes with the CRISPR/Cas9 endonuclease, a type of DNA cutting tool that can be designed to target very specific parts of the genetic code. When chromosomes carrying these modified genes come into contact with chromosomes without the gene variant, an enzyme is produced that cuts it, causing a break. The broken chromosome uses the chromosome carrying the desired variant as a template to repair itself, copying in the code with the altered gene variant. The team aims to improve the expression of their gene drive elements, but also to find more genes to target, which would reduce the possibility of mosquitoes evolving resistance to the modification. Exploring target genes is also helping the researchers to learn more about basic mosquito biology.  We hope others will use our technique to understand how mosquitoes work, giving us more ammunition in the fight against malaria,  said first author Andrew Hammond, also from Imperial s Department of Life Sciences.","Published: December 8, 2015"

The software is described in a paper published in the open access journal, eLife on December 3rd by researchers at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and the Center for Information Technology (CIT); along with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York City; Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut; Zhejiang University, China; and the University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington. NIBIB is part of the National Institutes of Health. As far as biologists have come in understanding the brain, much remains to be revealed. One significant challenge is determining the formation of complex neuronal structures made up of billions of cells in the human brain. As with many biological challenges, researchers are first examining this question in simpler organisms, such as worms. Although scientists have identified a number of important proteins that determine how neurons navigate during brain formation, it's largely unknown how all of these proteins interact in a living organism. Model animals, despite their differences from humans, have already revealed much about human physiology because they are much simpler and easier to understand. In this case, researchers chose Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), because it has only 302 neurons, 222 of which form while the worm is still an embryo. While some of these neurons go to the worm nerve ring (brain) they also spread along the ventral nerve cord, which is broadly analogous to the spinal cord in humans. The worm even has its own versions of many of the same proteins used to direct brain formation in more complex organisms such as flies, mice, or humans. ""Understanding why and how neurons form and the path they take to reach their final destination could one day give us valuable information about how proteins and other molecular factors interact during neuronal development,"" said Hari Shroff, Ph.D., head of the NIBIB research team. ""We don't yet understand neurodevelopment even in the context of the humble worm, but we're using it as a simple model of how these factors work together to drive the development of the worm brain and neuronal structure. We're hoping that by doing so, some of the lessons will translate all the way up to humans."" However, following neurons as they travel through the worm during its embryonic development is not as simple as it might seem. The first challenge was to create new microscopes that could record the embryogenesis of these worms without damaging them through too much light exposure while still getting the resolution needed to clearly see individual cells. Shroff and his team at NIBIB, in collaboration with Daniel Colon-Ramos at Yale University and Zhirong Bao at Sloan-Kettering, tackled this problem by developing new microscopes that improved the speed and resolution at which they could image worm embryonic development. The second problem was that during development the worm begins to ""twitch"", moving around inside the egg. The folding and twisting makes it hard to track cells and parse out movement. For example, if a neuron moves in the span of a couple of minutes, is it because the embryo twisted or because the neuron actually changed position within the embryo? Understanding the mechanisms that move neurons to their final destination is an important factor in understanding how brains form -- and is difficult to determine without knowing where and how a neuron is moving. Finally, it can be challenging to determine where a neuron is in 3D space while looking at a two-dimensional image -- especially of a worm that's folded up. ""Imagine you're trying to keep track of everyone in a crowded auditorium, except that you can only see one person at a time, and the auditorium itself is invisible. This is what it's like trying to track how neurons in the worm relate to each other,"" said Ryan Christensen, Ph.D., the postdoctoral fellow who led the project. ""You either need the ability to see everyone at once, or make the auditorium visible so you can place each person in the proper spot and figure out everyone's movements that way. Our untwisting software allows us to make the auditorium visible and allows us to place individual people (neurons) in their proper context."" The worm embryo is normally transparent, but the researchers made several cells in the embryo glow with fluorescent proteins to act as markers. When a microscopic image of these cells is fed into the program, the computer identifies each cell and uses the information to create a model of the worm, which it then computationally ""untwists"" to generate a straightened image. The program also enables a user to check the accuracy of the computer model and edit it when any mistakes are discovered. In addition, users can also mark cells or structures within the worm embryo they want the program to track, allowing the users to follow the position of a cell as it moves and grows in the developing embryo. This feature could help scientists understand how certain cells develop into neurons, as opposed to other types of cells, and what factors influence the development of the brain and neuronal structure. Shroff and his colleagues say that such technology will be pivotal in their project to create a 4D neurodevelopmental ""worm atlas,"" (see also (www.wormguides.org)) that attempts to catalog the formation of the worm nervous system. This catalog will be the first comprehensive view of how an entire nervous system develops, and Dr. Shroff and his colleagues believe that it will be helpful in understanding the fundamental mechanisms by which all nervous systems, including ours, assemble. They also expect that some of the concepts developed, such as the approach taken to combine neuronal data from multiple embryos, can be applied to additional model organisms besides the worm.","Published: December 8, 2015"

There are approximately 820,000 births per annum in France. Adgenix has already signed up its first laboratory customer for Premaitha in France, with a signed contract for a minimum of three years to supply LaboSud with the IONA  test. LaboSud is a private group of reference laboratories in the Montpellier region of France. It provides medical and diagnostic laboratory services to clinics and hospitals from the Languedoc-Roussillon region with plans to expand its offering to all of France. The IONA  test estimates the risk of a fetus being affected by Down s syndrome and other serious genetic conditions by analyzing cell-free fetal DNA from a sample of maternal blood, known as non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). Premaitha s test is more sensitive and specific than the current combined test available and provides pregnant women and their families with a more accurate and reliable screening result, helping reduce the need for invasive procedures that carry a risk of a miscarriage. The IONA  test enables clinical laboratories to be able to offer their own decentralized NIPT in-house service. The blood sample can be analyzed in local laboratories, such as LaboSud, rather than having to be shipped outside of France. This allows pregnant women and their healthcare providers to get much faster results, giving them the information they need to make informed decisions in a shorter timeframe, thereby helping to reduce stress and anxiety. Dr Stephen Little, CEO of Premaitha said:  Securing our first French partnership with LaboSud and Adgenix is an important step forward for us as we continue to expand the reach of the IONA  test across Europe. Our NIPT test provides more accurate and faster results that will benefit more pregnant women in France.  We look forward to getting the IONA  test up and running at LaboSud with our world class technical support team and training programme. The support of Adgenix as our local distributor has also been a huge benefit in establishing this customer and we hope to continue to develop this and other relationships.

The data are from a phase 1/2a clinical study in 52 heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The data, which were presented on Sunday, December 6, 2015, at the 2015 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting (ASH), show that MOR202 was safe and well tolerated with a 2-hour infusion time. The incidence of infusion-related reactions (IRR) was very low and mainly limited to the first infusion. In this heavily pre-treated patient population, MOR202 demonstrated encouraging responses with a best-in-class tolerability profile.  We are very pleased with the updated clinical results for MOR202. The clinically relevant dose regimens show encouraging clinical efficacy combined with a very good safety profile,  commented Dr. Arndt Schottelius, Chief Development Officer of MorphoSys AG.  The clinical study will continue as planned, focusing on combination cohorts, as we see the highest potential for MOR202 in combination therapy.  The ongoing phase 1/2a, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study is being conducted in several centers in Germany and Austria. The study is evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of MOR202 as monotherapy and in combination with the immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) pomalidomide (POM) and lenalidomide (LEN) plus dexamethasone (Dex) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The primary endpoints of the trial are the safety, tolerability and recommended dose of MOR202 alone and in combination with the IMiDs. Secondary outcome measures are pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy based on overall response rate, duration of response, time-to-progression, and progression-free survival. The data presented at ASH show that MOR202 can be safely administered as a 2-hour infusion and is well tolerated. Infusion-related reactions occurred in only 1 patient (6%) in the cohorts treated with the clinically relevant dose regimens. Patients has received a median of 4 prior therapies. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has not been reached. In the monotherapy group, comprising patients treated with the clinically relevant dose regimens, 3 out of 9 patients (33%) achieved an objective response rate, with the other 6 patients showing stable disease. In the early combination cohorts at 8 mg/kg MOR202 with IMiDs (n=6), 1 very good partial response (VGPR; to be confirmed in next response assessment), 2 partial responses (PR) and 1 minimal response (MR) were reported. In upcoming cohorts, patients will receive 16 mg/kg MOR202 in combination with pomalidomide (POM) and lenalidomide (LEN) plus dexamethasone. In addition, confirmatory cohorts are planned to validate the recommended dose of MOR202 as monotherapy and in combination with POM/Dex and LEN/Dex. MorphoSys also presented promising preclinical data demonstrating synergy of MOR202 in combination with different compounds representative of drug classes commonly used in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Another set of pre-clinical data focused on MOR202 s ability to kill targeted cells via ADCC. While MOR202 showed a level of killing of multiple myeloma cells equivalent to that of surrogates of daratumumab and isatuximab, it exhibited significantly reduced killing of NK cells. These results suggest that MOR202 may show a more durable clinical response than other compounds of its class, by sparing the NK cells needed for ADCC.","Published: December 8, 2015"

The study will be led by Tim Dudderidge MB ChB MSc FRCS (Urol) at the Southampton General Hospital and follows on from the recent successful screening trial involving 350 haematuria patients, which indicated the Mcm5-ELISA test has a Sensitivity of 83% Specificity of 77% and Negative Predictive Value of 98%. Roughly 65% of bladder cancer cases recur within five years and patients are routinely monitored on a periodic basis after treatment. Currently, this is done using cystoscopy, which is expensive and uncomfortable for patients. Arquer is developing a simple urine based test which aims to reduce the number of cystoscopies each bladder cancer patient undergoes. Arquer s Mcm5-ELISA diagnostic test detects the presence of minichromosome maintenance complex component 5 (Mcm5) protein in urine. MCM proteins are shed into urine by both prostate and bladder tumours and are known to be excellent biomarkers of cancer - being directly involved in cell replication. Arquer s diagnostic test originates from work conducted by Cambridge University and Cancer Research Technology (CRT), the development and commercialization arm of Cancer Research UK, and has been improved significantly during the last couple of years by the Arquer team led by CEO, Dr. Ian Campbell and Chairman, Dr. Sandy Primrose. The new study will involve at least 40 patients with diagnosed bladder cancer. The level of Mcm5 in their urine will be measured prior to treatment, and each time they return for follow-up over a six month period. It is hoped that the study will demonstrate the utility of the Mcm5-ELISA test both as a bladder cancer screening tool, and for the detection of bladder cancer in patients previously diagnosed and treated for the condition. Dr Ian Campbell, CEO, Arquer Diagnostics, commented:  We are committed to improving outcomes for bladder and prostate cancer patients. At present, over 150,000 cases of bladder cancer are diagnosed in Europe annually, and this number is increasing. The health economic benefits of our Mcm5-ELISA test would enable accurate, non-invasive close monitoring of the disease at low cost.  Dr Tim Dudderidge, Principal Investigator, commented:  There is currently an unmet need for a test that would allow for more screening and enable earlier detection of bladder cancer. The Mcm5-ELISA test has the potential to provide patients with a simple and non-invasive solution for screening, and for the detection of recurrence. ","Published: December 8, 2015"

Researchers have used fetal material, which is difficult to obtain and of variable quality. Embryonic stem cells represented a tremendous innovation, but making dopamine neurons from stem cells is a long process with a low yield. These issues have driven researchers to try to develop ways to turn cells that are easy to obtain, such as skin cells, into dopamine neurons, which are normally hidden in the brain. But here, too, it has been difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of neurons. Now, Parkinson's disease researchers at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo (UB) have developed a way to ramp up the conversion of skin cells into dopamine neurons. They have identified and found a way to overcome a key obstacle to such cellular conversions. At the same time, the researchers say the finding has profound implications for changing the way scientists work with all cells. The new research, published in Nature Communications, revolves around their discovery that p53, a transcription factor protein, acts as a gatekeeper protein. ""We found that p53 tries to maintain the status quo in a cell, it guards against changes from one cell type to another,"" explained Jian Feng, PhD, senior author and professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB. ""We found that p53 acts as a kind of gatekeeper protein to prevent conversion into another type of cell. Once we lowered the expression of p53, then things got interesting: We were able to reprogram the fibroblasts into neurons much more easily."" The advance has importance to basic cell biology, Feng said. ""This is a generic way for us to change cells from one type to another,"" he said. ""It proves that we can treat the cell as a software system, when we remove the barriers to change. If we can identify transcription factor combinations that control which genes are turned on and off, we can change how the genome is being read. We might be able to play with the system more quickly and we might be able to generate tissues similar to those in the body, even brain tissue. ""People like to think that things proceed in a hierarchical way, that we start from a single cell and develop into an adult with about 40 trillion cells, but our results prove that there is no hierarchy,"" he continued. ""All our cells have the same source code as our first cell; this code is read differently to generate all types of cells that make up the body."" Timing was key to their success. ""We found that the point in the cell cycle just before the cell tries to sense its environment to ensure that all is ready for duplicating the genome, is the prime time when the cell is receptive to change,"" said Feng. By lowering the genomic gatekeeper p53 at the right time of cell cycle, they could easily turn the skin cells into dopamine neurons, with transcription factor combinations discovered in previous studies. These manipulations turn on the expression of Tet1, a DNA modification enzyme that changes how the genome is read. ""Our method is faster and much more efficient than previously developed ones,"" said Feng. ""The best previous method could take two weeks to produce 5 percent dopamine neurons. With ours, we got 60 percent dopamine neurons in ten days."" The researchers have done multiple experiments to prove that these neurons are functional mid-brain dopaminergic neurons, the type lost in Parkinson's disease. The finding enables researchers to generate patient-specific neurons in a dish that could then be transplanted into the brain to repair the faulty neurons. It can also be used to efficiently screen new treatments for Parkinson's disease. University at Buffalo  Original reporting by: Ellen Goldbaum Jiang H et al.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/the-virushost-arms-race-211990,The Virus Host Arms Race Not every virus wants to go viral   at least  not immediately  Some want to slip in quietly  Hide  Wait for the perfect opportunity to attack  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In order to do so, the virus has to find a way to enter the cells of the human body without tripping the alarm, and stay there without notice. It's how HIV works, and also how viruses in the herpesvirus family, like human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), do their business. In a new study, a group of University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers show that individual cells in the human body have an armament designed to prevent HCMV from achieving and maintaining this latency, to shine a spotlight on the virus so the immune system knows to fight. But the virus, in turn, has developed ways to thwart these defenses. ""We call it an arms race,"" says study leader Rob Kalejta, professor of molecular virology and oncology at UW-Madison. ""Virus evolves a mechanism to persist, human cells evolve a way to defeat that mechanism, virus evolves a way to defeat what the cell just evolved."" The study shows there are potential ways to intervene in that process, says Albright. Its co-lead authors are UW-Madison graduate student Emily Albright and former postdoctoral researcher Song Hee Lee. HCMV infects people at high rates all around the world. People with compromised or weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable. In newborn babies, the virus can cause deafness, intellectual disability and learning disorders. Other viruses in the herpesvirus family can cause cancer, shingles and mononucleosis. Once people are infected, they will have the virus their entire lives, due to its ability to cycle between latent and active states in the body. ""Our immune system does a pretty good job at fighting lytic (active) herpesviruses, but it has no chance against the latent reservoir,"" says Kalejta. The human immune system is made of two main branches: innate and adaptive. One is more general - the immediate response to a cut in your skin - and the other more specialized, responding specifically to a variety of pathogens that invade the body. But there is a third, more recently described, arm called intrinsic immunity, where individual cells in the body protect themselves from infection without calling on the body's immune defenses. Active HCMV is obvious to the body's innate and adaptive immune systems, producing proteins and other viral material that serve as red flags to the body's security system. But latent HCMV shuts down the processes that allow it to be found.  Previous studies in the lab showed that once HCMV is inside the cell, it quickly becomes latent by entering the cell's nucleus and co-opting a cellular protein called Daxx - part of the intrinsic immune system - to shut down its own replication, the process of reproducing its genetic material to make more copies of itself. This process would otherwise trigger a healthy immune system to respond. Instead, it can hide and wait for a time when a person's immune system is weakened. In the new study, expanding upon what scientists previously understood about intrinsic immunity, the researchers found that cells can subsequently respond to latent HCMV by employing other cellular proteins called lysine demethylases to reactivate the virus. ""When you think about defending yourself against a virus, you usually think about turning it off, but this is what the virus wants to do when it goes latent,"" Kalejta says. ""So this intrinsic immune system is trying to convert it from a latent to a lytic infection so that we at least have a fighting chance against it."" But the wily virus fights back.  The research team learned the virus brings with it to the cell a protein called UL138 that blocks the cellular lysine demethylases from turning the virus back on. ""We showed that UL138 prevents the cellular proteins from getting to the viral genome, and if they can't get there, they can't turn it on,"" says Albright. The researchers are not yet sure how UL138 accomplishes this. The cellular proteins are located in the nucleus of the cell, where the virus maintains its genetic material. But UL138, the viral protein, is actually located outside the nucleus, at a cellular component called the Golgi. The viral protein outside the nucleus is somehow preventing the cellular proteins in the nucleus from accessing the viral genome, which is also in the nucleus. ""We'd like to know how that works,"" Albright adds. The study of HCMV is revealing new ways in which human cells function, highlighting the role of proteins and other factors that have never been described in these ways before. It is opening new avenues of scientific inquiry. ""We've shown that cells can defend themselves against latent viruses,"" says Kalejta. ""So if cells can do that, maybe scientists can, too. We are years away from that, but it gives us hope that cures are possible.""

A cancer cell that has spread to another part of the body needs help from the tissue that surrounds it to become established and form a new tumour. When a cell has the environment it needs, it will start to grow. The researchers showed in mice that cancer cells that are able to spread easily produce a protein called THSB2 which helps them to make their new environment more welcoming   allowing tumours to grow. THSB2 does this by activating cells called fibroblasts, which normally help to build tissue in the body but can also support cancer growth. Lead investigator Dr Ilaria Malanchi, Cancer Research UK scientist and group leader at The Francis Crick Institute, said:  If we can find a way to block the ability of a cancer cell to adapt to a new environment then this could slow down the growth of cancer to other parts of the body.  The more THSB2 protein the cell produces, the faster the new tissue environment will change to give the best conditions for cancer growth.  This is an exciting first step and what we need now is to find drugs that could stop cancer cells producing this protein and see if this reduces their ability to spread to new part of the body.  Professor Nic Jones, Cancer Research UK s chief scientist, said:  One of the biggest challenges in successfully treating cancer is stopping it from spreading to other parts of the body. It s a complicated process and research like this brings us a small step closer to understanding how we might stop it from happening and so save more lives. ","Published: December 7, 2015"

Many people have experience with antibiotics being ineffective at alleviating the symptoms of an infection, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria are becoming increasingly concerning,  says Ms Richter, who is based at the Basil Hetzel Institute for Translational Health Research and is working alongside leading University of Adelaide ENT surgeon, Professor Peter-John Wormald.  Severe and chronic infections present as a cluster of bacterial cells covered in a slimy matrix (biofilms). Biofilms act like an armour and protect the bacteria from the immune system and medications   the thicker the biofilm, the less likely antibiotics will work.  Due to the spread of antibiotic resistance, millions of people suffer and die from devastating and recurring biofilm infections, like endocarditis, chronic wounds, cystic fibrosis or osteomyelitis,  she says. Ms Richter says her new treatment captures the food source required for bacteria to survive and grow.   I ve identified pathways which are essential for bacterial growth and survival,  says Ms Richter.  From this finding, I ve discovered how to attack biofilms with two compounds that are not based on antibiotics. The first compound depletes nutrients from bacteria, leaving the cells vulnerable, while the second kills the bacteria.  And, because this treatment works differently to antibiotics, we haven t faced any resistant bacteria yet,  she says. Ms Richter s research is specifically looking at how to combat chronic sinus infections, which are highly prevalent and affect people of all ages.  One in six Australians suffers from a chronic infection of the sinuses and the primary goal of my PhD research is to improve medical therapies for the treatment of severe and recurring sinus infections,  says Ms Richter.  My results have been very promising and show that this combination therapy is an efficient and safe way to kill bacterial biofilms. And based on my research, TQEH ENT Surgery Department will commence the first human trial next year.  The trial will combine the two compounds in a drug-delivery device to aid wound healing and combat disease causing bacteria.  A successful clinical trial will hopefully lead us to further refine the treatment so it can eventually be used to treat people suffering from a broad range of chronic infections,  she says.

It also found that new funding for Ebola R&D mobilised in response to the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak was entirely responsible for the $150m increase in neglected disease R&D funding in 2014, with funding for all other neglected diseases essentially unchanged (down $14m, or 0.4%). The report found that a total of $165m was invested in Ebola R&D in 2014, more than for any other neglected disease except HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis (TB) and diarrhoeal diseases. Most of this funding came from the US Government, whose $101m contribution represented 86% of all public funding for Ebola R&D in 2014. ""This represents significant new investment in Ebola R&D, which was mobilised very quickly,"" said report co-author Dr. Nick Chapman, Director of Research at Policy Cures. ""The challenge will be to make sure that this attention and funding is maintained as the epidemic subsides, to ensure that these products complete development."" This was the first year that Ebola has been included in the G-FINDER report, but past investment has generally been minimal, at a little over $10m per year globally. The report also noted that when Ebola is excluded, public funding for neglected disease R&D was actually at its lowest level in seven years, with public funding for non-Ebola R&D dropping by $62m in 2014. As the world's biggest funder of neglected disease R&D, much of this decline has been driven by the US Government. US Government funding for non-Ebola neglected disease R&D fell again in 2014 - further extending the large sequester-related cuts of the previous year - to be nearly a quarter of a billion dollars ($221m) below its 2009 peak. Dr. Chapman said: ""The response to Ebola has shown us what is possible. There would be a huge impact if we could translate this political and financial commitment to other neglected diseases - many of which cause more deaths in developing countries every year than Ebola, but received a fraction of the funding that Ebola did in 2014."" After the last G-FINDER report highlighted concerns about the declining pharmaceutical industry contribution to neglected disease R&D funding, this year's report found that industry investment in neglected disease R&D increased by more than a quarter from the previous year, only partly due to Ebola. This $98m increase was the first since 2010, and resulted in the largest industry investment in neglected disease R&D in the history of the G-FINDER survey. However the industry withdrawal from TB R&D continued, with industry TB investment now a third lower than its peak in 2010. ""The significant new industry investment in R&D for Ebola, malaria and HIV/AIDS shows that industry can contribute significant financial resources - as well as product development expertise - in the right conditions,"" Dr Chapman said. ""But the challenge is ensuring that this investment happens. The ongoing cuts in industry investment in TB remain a concern, given increasing rates of drug resistance."" In positive news, funding for product development partnerships (PDPs) increased for the second year in a row, driven by increased funding from the Gates Foundation. PDPs are instrumental in the development of new tools to fight neglected diseases of patients in developing countries, and are involved in nearly every second product in the neglected disease pipeline, despite receiving just 16% of global funding.","Published: December 7, 2015"

The findings suggest that therapies could one day treat the root cause of cystic fibrosis, not just the symptoms.  The proteins and the interactions we ve identified really fuel the pipeline for new drug targets to treat cystic fibrosis,  said Casimir Bamberger, a research associate in the lab of TSRI Professor John R. Yates and co-first author of the new study with TSRI Staff Scientist Sandra Pankow. The Root Cause of Cystic Fibrosis People with cystic fibrosis suffer from persistent infections and mucus build-up in the lungs. While there are treatments to deal with the symptoms such as antibiotics for infections there are no therapies that fully restore lung function. Bamberger, Pankow and their colleagues believe a better understanding of a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) could be the key to developing new treatments. Most patients with cystic fibrosis have a mutation, called  F508, in the gene that encodes CFTR, keeping CFTR from folding properly and being processed correctly in cells. Interestingly, previous studies showed that mutant CFTR regains normal functions at low temperatures.  Freezing people is not a practical treatment, of course, but this showed us mutant CFTR can be functional,  said Pankow.  So the idea behind our new study was to find new drug candidates that could mimic what we see at low temperatures.  Finding Drug Targets In the new study, the researchers analyzed cell samples with a tool called Co-Purifying Protein Identification Technology (CoPIT), a new method they developed to identify proteins and analyze data. With CoPIT, they identified almost every protein CFTR interacted with even tracking the secondary and tertiary protein interactions. The results were surprising. While it was thought that most mutant proteins just lack one or two crucial interactions, the  F508 CFTR mutant had acquired an entirely new  disease-specific  interaction network.  Three hundred proteins changed their level of interaction, and an additional 200 proteins interacted with the mutated CFTR,  said Pankow.  It s like the wrong people are talking to the mutated CFTR all the time.  The researchers narrowed these mutant protein interactions to just eight key disruptive proteins. The team then used a gene silencing approach to remove or  knock down  those proteins and block the interaction of these proteins with  F508 CFTR. They found that without the additional interactions,  F508 CFTR partially returned to normal function. Pankow and Bamberger said the next step in this research is to look for small molecule drug candidates that could target these disruptive proteins. The researchers have also released their raw CoPIT data publicly so other scientists can explore the clinical implications of CFTR interactions.","Published: December 7, 2015"

By preventing significant damage and inflammation of the appendix during a bacterial attack, ILCs safeguard the organ and help it to perform an important function in the body, as a natural reservoir for  good  bacteria.  Professor Gabrielle Belz, a laboratory head in the institute s Molecular Immunology division, said the study s findings show that the appendix deserves more credit than it has historically been given.  Popular belief tells us the appendix is a liability,  she said.  Its removal is one of the most common surgical procedures in Australia, with more than 70,000 operations each year. However, we may wish to rethink whether the appendix is so irrelevant for our health.  We ve found that ILCs may help the appendix to potentially reseed  good  bacteria within the microbiome   or community of bacteria   in the body. A balanced microbiome is essential for recovery from bacterial threats to gut health, such as food poisoning.  Professor Belz said having a healthy appendix might even save people from having to stomach more extreme options for repopulating   or  balancing out    their microbiomes.  In certain cases, people require reseeding of their intestines with healthy bacteria by faecal transplant   a process where intestinal bacteria is transplanted to a sick person from a healthy individual,  Professor Belz said.  Our research suggests ILCs may be able to play this important part in maintaining the integrity of the appendix.  We found ILCs are part of a multi-layered protective armoury of immune cells that exist in healthy individuals. So even when one layer is depleted, the body has  back ups  that can fight the infection.  In people who have compromised immune systems   such as people undergoing cancer treatment   these cells are vital for fighting bacterial infections in the gastrointestinal system. This is particularly important because ILCs are able to survive in the gut even during these treatments, which typically wipe out other immune cells.  Professor Belz has previously shown that diet, such as the proteins in leafy green vegetables, could help produce ILCs.  ILCs are also known to play a role in allergic diseases, such as asthma; inflammatory bowel disease; and psoriasis,  she said.  So it is vital that we better understand their role in the intestine and how we might manipulate this population to treat disease, or promote better health. ","Published: December 7, 2015"

The concept is known as programmed cell death (PCD). Since the early 2000s, when PCD was confirmed, research has focused mainly on finding genes and proteins that trigger it. However, processes aiding cell survival have not been well understood. A recent paper published by researchers from Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), establishes that in mouse cells, proteins comprising the CCR4-NOT complex are actively involved in regulation of a form of PCD called necroptosis.  It is one step toward deciphering the mechanisms of cell death,  says Dr Toru Suzuki, group leader at the Cell Signal Unit, led by Prof. Tadashi Yamamoto. Suicidal Programmes The most studied form of PCD is apoptosis   a process of cellular self-destruction, distinguished by fragmentation of nuclear DNA and cell shrinkage. Initially it was thought to be the only suicidal mechanism cells possess. Another well-known cell suicidal programme is autophagy, in which a cell cannibalises itself by degrading its proteins into amino acids. About 10 years ago another form of PCD was discovered. It was named necroptosis, as it shares some characteristics of apoptosis, such as rigorous gene-level regulation, and necrosis, an inflammatory cell death in which the cell membrane swells and later breaks, leaking its contents into the intercellular space. Necroptosis can be a fail-safe mechanism in case apoptosis is inhibited, for example, by bacteria or viruses.PCD is an important mechanism in organismal development, tissue homeostasis, and elimination of old cells, which are incapable of maintenance or division, or potentially harmful cells. When suicidal programmes go awry, things start to break down. For example, neurodegeneration results from too many cells being culled by PCD and leads to incurable diseases such as Huntington s, Alzheimer s, and Parkinson s. Understanding the mechanisms of PCD may yield keys to curing the above-mentioned and many other diseases. Suicide Prevention Complex Dr Suzuki proposes that one of the possible mechanisms triggering necroptosis is the suppression of degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA), which transports the encoded protein sequence (the message) from the cell nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where the proteins are actually synthesised. As long as a given mRNA persists in the cytoplasm, it can be used to produce more protein that it encodes. Thus, regulation of the lifespans of mRNAs is a way of controlling protein synthesis. The CCR4-NOT complex regulates gene expression by processing, controlling quality, and marking mRNAs for destruction by shortening their poly(A) tails   chains of adenine nucleotides at the end of mRNA molecules. One of the key elements in CCR4-NOT s regulatory activity is one of its component proteins, CNOT3. Experiments conducted by Dr Suzuki s group showed that suppression of CNOT3 in mouse cells leads to necroptosis. In the CNOT3-depleted cells the stability and expression of  mRNAs encoding RIPK1 and RIPK3 proteins, which are directly associated with necroptosis, are increased. This leads to build-up of death-triggering proteins and cell demise. These results suggest that some human inflammatory diseases associated with necrotic cell death, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, may be caused by deregulation of the CCR4-NOT complex. Analysis of other components of the CCR4-NOT complex in CNOT3-deficient cells suggests that this protein plays a vital role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the entire complex and that it is crucial for cell viability. Moreover, only normal, intact CNOT3 protein can rescue dying cells  viability and growth. A mutant form of the protein, missing its C-terminal amino acids   a docking station for other proteins of the CCR4-NOT complex   was unable to aid cell survival. Dr Suzuki s research indicates that cell viability is regulated by both life- and death-inducing molecules. It is one step forward in the fight with diseases associated with unnecessary cell death or long-lived abnormal cells.","Published: December 7, 2015"

The new findings suggest that the Musashi genes, MSI1 and MSI2, act in a path parallel to the Wnt pathway and may be equally important for driving colon cancer. The work also indicates that the two genes, which encode RNA-binding proteins, are functionally redundant.  The data suggest that either MSI protein is sufficient to support cancer,  Lengner said.  If you want to use these proteins as a drug target, you d have to design a drug that will inhibit both of them. While researchers have known for some time that MSI1 was expressed in colon cancer, the mechanism by which it acted and its functional requirement for the disease were not well understood. The related protein MSI2 had not been rigorously examined in the context of colon cancer until earlier this year, when a paper by Lengner and colleagues found that it could trigger activation of cellular metabolic processes that fuel cancerous cells in the intestines.  Considering the expression patterns of these two proteins during homeostasis, or normal conditions, you would expect their function when they were hijacked by cancer could be similar in supporting tumor growth,  said Ning Li, first author on the study and a postdoctoral fellow in Lengner s lab. The current work took both proteins into account. Whereas the prior paper found that MSI2 was consistently overexpressed in intestinal cancer tissue, Lengner and colleagues found that MSI1 was more variable, overexpressed in some samples and underexpressed in others, compared to normal tissue. When they bred mice in which they could induce overexpression of MSI1 in the intestine, the cells of the intestine began to divide rapidly and lost their ability to differentiate, just as mice with inducible overexpression of MSI2 had. They found that inducing MSI1 turned on a similar set of genes as MSI2 overexpression did, including genes related to RNA processing and translation, necessary processes for manufacturing the required components for cancer s rapid cell growth. The analysis also revealed that activating MSI1 caused a set of genes to be expressed that match the effect of losing the function of APC, a tumor suppressor gene that is inactivated in more than 80 percent of cases of human colon cancer. As they had done with MSI2, the researchers also conducted an experiment that reveals the RNA transcripts to which MSI1 binds, and they found high levels of similarity to the set of transcripts bound by MSI2. Notably, both proteins bind tumor suppressors, such as Pten, which activates cellular metabolism through a protein complex called mTORC1. Further experiments confirmed MSI1 promoted mTORC1 activity.  We concluded that these proteins are functioning in the same pathways and acting redundantly not only because they are binding similar proteins but also because when you overexpress them, the phenotype is identical,  Lengner said.  They appear to have identical oncogenic properties.  To confirm whether both MSI1 and MSI2 are necessary for tumor formation, the researchers inhibited one or the other or both in several human colorectal cancer cell lines. Whereas inhibiting only MSI1 blocked growth of some cell lines but not others, inhibiting both MSI1 and MSI2 together effectively blocked cell growth in all of them. Adding an inhibitor of  -catenin, the downstream mediator of the Wnt pathway, synergized with MSI inhibition to completely block tumor cell growth. The research team performed a similar experiment in vivo, developing mice that had only one copy of APC, and were thus at a heightened risk of developing colorectal tumors, and could be induced to either lack MSI1, MSI2 or both in their intestinal tissue. While knocking out one or the other MSI proteins didn t affect tumor formation, knocking out both genes markedly reduced the tumors in these mice. Performing the same experiments in mice that develop an inflammation-induced form of colorectal cancer that more closely resembles the human disease, the team again found Msi loss was completely protective against tumor formation.  By deleting both MSIs we find that it completely blocks the tumors from forming, but other than that the tissue seems to be perfectly normal,  Lengner said.  This is interesting because it s what one would look for in an ideal cancer target, something that, when you inhibit it, it can block cancer progression without adversely effecting the normal tissue.  Lengner also noted that blocking the mTORC1 pathway might be another viable strategy for targeting the downstream activity of the MSI proteins, perhaps in combination with an inhibition of Wnt/ -catenin, a pathway the researchers believe may act distinctly but parallel to MSI activity.  There are already mTORC1 inhibitors in existence, so one could imagine a combined approach could be an effective strategy,  Lengner said. Moving forward with this work, Lengner and colleagues plan to investigate which specific cell types the MSI proteins act upon and to delve deeper to understand how APC inactivation triggers colon cancer through  -catenin and other avenues.","Published: December 7, 2015"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/purity-of-tumor-samples-may-significantly-bias-genomic-analyses-206505, Purity  Of Tumor Samples May Significantly Bias Genomic Analyses Non cancerous tumor components influence research findings  clinical classifications  study shows  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A new study by UC San Francisco scientists shows that the proportion of normal cells, especially immune cells, intermixed with cancerous cells in a given tissue sample may significantly skew the results of genetic analyses and other tests performed both by researchers and by physicians selecting precision therapies. It has long been known that tumors may contain a variety of healthy cells as well as cancerous cells, and it is believed that this heterogeneity underlies resistance to various cancer therapies. But this problem has not been thoroughly investigated, said the researchers, who show that factoring precise measures of tumor ""purity"" into common analytical techniques may clarify some basic principles of cancer biology as well as open new therapeutic avenues for patients. (In research parlance, pure tumors are those that are entirely, or mostly, composed of cancer cells.) In one medically relevant example from the new work the team found that measures used to predict the effectiveness of checkpoint-inhibitor drugs, the most widely used form of cancer immunotherapy, are accurate only when the extent of infiltration of immune cells into the tumor was explicitly quantified. When this aspect of tumor purity was not accounted for, estimates of the likely success of immunotherapy were either too high or too low.  Tumor purity is a big problem when you re dealing with fresh tissue from real patients rather than with cell lines, and there has been no systematic analysis of this issue,  said first author Dvir Aran, PhD, a postdoctoral associate in the laboratory of Atul Butte, MD, PhD, director of UCSF s Institute for Computational Health Sciences (ICHS).  In the case of immunotherapy, it s an expensive treatment and it can have side effects,  Aran said,  so it s important to know which patients are most likely to benefit. If we pay more attention to the immune cells that are actually in tumors we may have more success.  For their study, the research group   which also included ICHS member Marina Sirota, PhD, assistant professor of pediatrics at UCSF   made use of a massive dataset known as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a joint initiative of the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute. The TCGA dataset is derived from samples of tumors and normal tissue from 11,000 patients, and represents 33 types of cancer. Using this resource, the team used four different methods to measure tumor purity in more than 10,000 TCGA samples representing 21 cancer types, and examined how purity might affect the reliability of three of the most common genomic methods used in cancer research: correlation, clustering, and differential analysis. Correlational techniques reveal so-called co-expression networks   genes that tend to be expressed together most frequently in tumor samples   with the aim of identifying molecular pathways that drive malignancy and metastasis. In a type of bladder cancer known as bladder carcinoma, for example, two genes called JAK3 andCSF1R tend to be jointly expressed at high levels, which suggests that they somehow act together to drive the cancer. But the UCSF team found that the tandem expression of JAK3 and CSF1R in bladder carcinoma varied widely if tumor purity was taken into account   in the purest samples there was little correlation between the expression of the two genes, calling their potential joint role in a cancer-driving pathway into question. Similar potentially disruptive effects of tumor purity were seen in clustering, which groups cancers into subtypes based on molecular markers, with the hope of arriving at more precise treatments, and in differential analysis, which compares gene expression in tumors and normal tissue in order to uncover genetic flaws distinctive to cancer. In their analyses of samples of lung cancer, kidney cancer, and thyroid cancer, the group found that, if tumor purity were not taken into account, differential analysis could yield misleading results on the relative expression of proteins called CTLA-4 and CD86, both important targets in cancer immunotherapy. A high ""mutational burden"" in a given tumor, essentially a higher number of cancer-driving genes carrying mutations, is often thought to be a genetic signature that predicts a positive response to immunotherapy, but again the UCSF team found that this measure is highly correlated with the purity of a given sample: purer tumor samples that consisted mostly of cancerous cells had a lower overall mutational burden. Since inflammatory responses induced by immune cells are known to increase mutation rates in cancer cells, the team proposes that tumors carrying more mutations may respond better to immunotherapy simply because more immune cells are already present in the tumor, and can be activated against it.  Mutational burden is a useful measure, because it identifies genes and pathways that may lead tumors to respond to conventional targeted drugs,  said Sirota.  But if it is the greater infiltration of immune cells in a tumor that makes it more sensitive to immunotherapy, we should try to measure that directly as well.  To that end, Aran said that he hopes that simple and inexpensive tests of tumor purity might soon be built into genomic studies in both the laboratory and the clinic.  Cancer isn t just one big blob,  said Butte, a member of the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.  Instead, tumors are a complex microenvironment containing a number of cell types   normal and cancerous   that all act upon one another. If we hope to advance our understanding of cancer and to devise new treatments we need to truly understand how tumors are made up, and to take that makeup into account when we do genomic studies.  The scientists said that their findings underscore the power of computational approaches to health in general, and the importance of large, open-access datasets like TCGA in particular.  Datasets are the ultimate commodity,  Butte said.  Unlike oil or water, which can only be used once, data can continually generate new insights.  And, added Sirota,  though each research team may be looking at the same dataset, they can ask completely different questions. ","Published: December 7, 2015"

The funding will be used to support the development and launch of LindaCare s product in key markets in Europe. LindaCare s first version of the product is a web-based software platform for the tele-monitoring of patients suffering from chronic heart failure (CHF) and cardiac arrhythmia with Cardiac Implanted Electronic Devices (CIED), estimated at about 10 million patients worldwide. Part of the proceeds will also be used to extend the software tele-monitoring platform into other chronic disease areas such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). LindaCare started off with the concrete frustrations of a nurse, Linda, confronted on a daily basis with the complexity of having to manage a variety of different tele-monitoring systems from several vendors in order to properly follow up large numbers of patients. The current patient follow-up process using tele-monitoring is very inefficient and human resource intensive. It creates a potential risk factor in quality of patient care and is an obstacle for extending the enrolment of tele-monitored patients.  By simplifying patient tele-monitoring, LindaCare will help healthcare professionals and hospitals reduce cost of delivery of care, improve quality of care and patient safety for chronic disease management,  states Shahram Sharif, CEO and founder of LindaCare.  LindaCare s ambition is to be the leading integrator solution partner for all tele-monitoring needs for hospitals and care providers, across a range of tele-monitoring devices covering multiple chronic disease domains. Capricorn s investment, as well as earlier incubation support from iMinds (selected into iStart incubation program) and Microsoft Innovation Center (winning project MIC Hack For Health), helped enable us to achieve this ambition,  concludes Shahram Sharif.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/drugging-bacteria-192894,Drugging Bacteria Commonly used diabetes drug impacts gut bacteria more than disease itself  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Metformin, the drug most often used to treat type 2 diabetes, has a greater effect on gut microbes than the disease itself. The finding, by scientists at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany, and colleagues in the EU-funded MetaHIT consortium, has implications for studies searching for links between our microbiomes and disease. Published in Nature, the study points to new approaches for understanding how metformin works, and minimizing the side effects of a drug that patients take in high doses for many years.  It s surprising that this single drug triggers such a noticeable change in our microbes,  says Peer Bork, who led the work at EMBL.  Now think how many drugs are out there, and how many people take several drugs daily: even if only a fraction of drugs have this big an impact, they could still be dramatically shaping people s gut.  Metformin is a drug commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes, to help control blood sugar levels. It is typically administered in relatively high doses. And, as type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease, patients usually take the drug for years. But exactly how it acts inside patients  bodies is not yet entirely clear. The scientists compared stool samples from over 700 people, including patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy people. The team found that, based on the communities of microbes present in a person s stool, they couldn t reliably tell if the person had diabetes or not   unless the person took metformin. Patients who took the drug had considerably more E.coli and fewer I. bartletti bacteria than healthy people and patients who did not take metformin.  The differences we observed in microbial communities could explain some of metformin s side effects, which means anyone trying to minimize those side effects could think about acting on the microbes in the gut,  says Kristoffer Forslund, from Bork s lab. Someday, a person taking metformin might conceivably also get a yoghurt or dietary supplement to help maintain the balance of their inner microbial community, the scientists postulate. The findings also explain the contradictory results of previous studies trying to establish how the community of microbe species in the gut differs between healthy people and people with type 2 diabetes. The fact that different studies found different microbial communities associated with diabetes was probably because more patients took metformin in one study than in another. For scientists searching for bacterial  fingerprints  that could be used to diagnose or treat diseases such as diabetes, the current study highlights the importance of considering whether treatments are influencing   and potentially confounding   the results.  Our study sets a new standard for exploring the impact of various disorders on the human gut microbiota,  says Oluf Pedersen, who led the study at Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Metabolic research at University of Copenhagen.  Ideally, future studies should be run in treatment-na ve patients to avoid confounding effects of medications on disease-specific imbalances of intestinal microbes.   This work really highlights the importance of the gut microbiome, not just in keeping us healthy but also in influencing how we react to treatments,  says Dusko Ehrlich, from the French Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA), in France, who led the MetaHIT consortium.  These findings really show we re not alone: the medicines we swallow don t just affect us directly. They can have a profound impact on our microbial  inhabitants , too,  Bork concludes.","Published: December 5, 2015"

A step towards gene therapy against intractable epilepsy By delivering genes for a certain signal substance and its receptor into the brain of test animals with chronic epilepsy, a research group at Lund University in Sweden with colleagues at University of Copenhagen Denmark has succeeded in considerably reducing the number of epileptic seizures among the animals. The test has been designed to as far as possible mimic a future situation involving treatment of human patients.   Prenatal maternal iron intake shown to affect the neonatal brain In the first study of its kind, researchers have shown that inadequate maternal iron intake during pregnancy exerts subtle effects on infant brain development. The findings have been published in the journal Pediatric Research. The research indicates the potential significance for the child of even modest changes in maternal dietary health.   Cannabis increases the noise in your brain Several studies have demonstrated that the primary active constituent of cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (?9-THC), induces transient psychosis-like effects in healthy subjects similar to those observed in schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not clear. A new study, published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, reports that ?9-THC increases random neural activity, termed neural noise, in the brains of healthy human subjects.

But some infants who recover from repairs to their hearts later show the effects of delays in brain development, including impairments to cognitive, language and social functioning. Such impairments can affect how well these children do in school and in the workplace; they can even diminish their overall quality of life. Epidemiological studies have given numbers to what doctors and families have long observed: The risk of neurodevelopmental delays is tenfold higher for children with moderate to severe congenital heart disease than for other children. Over the years, those who study these phenomena have considered several possible reasons. Do the rigors of open-heart surgery so soon after birth play a role? Could heart defects limit nutrients and oxygen needed by the fetus? Or could spontaneous genetic mutations cause congenital problems that affect both the heart and the brain of a child? Now, the 'why' may have been answered by the efforts of the Pediatric Cardiovascular Genetics Consortium, led by a team of Harvard Medical School scientists. In a recent issue of Science the consortium reported exome sequence analyses of more than 1,200 children and their parents and showed that children with both congenital heart disease and neurodevelopmental delays share certain genetic mutations that thwart the normal development of both the heart and the brain. Using a mathematical model created by co-authors Kaitlin Samocha and Mark Daly of the Analytical and Translational Genetics Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, the team analyzed mutations in the protein-coding portion of the genomes of children with congenital heart disease that were not present in their parents' genomes. They found that these children have more of these de novo mutations in genes that are highly expressed in the developing heart, compared to a control cohort of children without congenital heart disease. The de novo mutations were also found to be more frequent in children with congenital heart disease plus another birth defect, either neurodevelopmental delay or more-subtle abnormalities of finger or ear shape. These findings bolster the case for shared genetic causes of the cardiac and extra-cardiac abnormalities rather than surgeries or environmental factors. ""We're homing in on a set of genes that have multiple different roles in multiple different tissues during development: heart tissue, brain tissue, other developing organs, limb tissue,"" said Jason Homsy, an HMS LaDue Fellow who trained at Mass General and co-lead author of the Science paper. ""Our study shows a common genetic link for the development of these diseases."" According to Homsy and co-senior author Christine Seidman, the HMS Thomas W. Smith Professor of Genetics and Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, these findings could lead to early testing that would help identify newborns with congenital heart disease who are at high risk of neurodevelopmental difficulties. ""We can pretty clearly tell the parents of children with congenital heart disease what's going to happen after the heart surgery, but there's always a big question: Will my kid learn well in school?"" Seidman said. ""If we could identify children at high risk for neurodevelopmental delays, they could receive increased surveillance and earlier interventions than occur now."" The mutations primarily affected genes involved in three areas: morphogenesis, chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation. If any one of these processes is perturbed even slightly at a critical time in development, the heart is malformed; sometimes another developmental defect occurs, such as a missed connection in the brain. ""These genes are not just involved in shaping the heart,"" Seidman said. ""They are master regulators of organ development."" One of the mutated genes is RBFOX2, which encodes a molecule that regulates RNA splicing. Although RBFOX2 has not been previously implicated in congenital heart disease, de novo mutations were identified in multiple affected children. ""There are still many unanswered questions, including why the same mutation can cause very different clinical manifestations,"" Seidman said. Perhaps additional genetic variants in the multiple layers of transcriptional regulation allow compensation for some mutations but worsen the consequences of others. For now, Seidman said, knowing that a genetic mutation is present is different from knowing the outcome. ""It's a long, long, long way down the road,"" Seidman said, ""but we'd like to believe that if you knew the steps by which these mutations perturbed the regulation of gene expression, there might even be ways to actually treat it.""

A geneticist from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) in the United States has used powerful internet and social media tools to find doctors and researchers in nine US states and eight other nations to help him confirm, document and describe in precise clinical detail a new genetic syndrome in young boys that he first came across five years ago. Still lacking a name, the rare syndrome causes developmental delays and intellectual disability (ID), usually severe. Affected children also often have a characteristic set of facial malformations and weak muscle tone throughout the body, a condition doctors call generalized hypotonia. A paper appears in the American Journal of Human Genetics and describes 14 cases, involving boys from 11 unrelated families. ""Informally, we call this 'TAF1 syndrome,' because the TAF1 gene, located on the X chromosome, is mutated in all patients,"" says CSHL Assistant Professor Gholson Lyon, MD, PhD. A child psychiatrist as well as a genetics researcher, Lyon first began thinking about the syndrome in 2010, when he was introduced to a family in Utah with two young boys who were both seriously ill, in similar ways. ""The boys, two years apart, suffered from intellectual disability,"" Lyon notes, ""but they also had other symptoms in common, including particular facial dysmorphologies, that were not quite like anything described in the medical literature. Since then, I've been working in various ways to understand the condition, including finding other physicians and geneticists who may have seen similar patients."" Lyon, who in 2011 reported the discovery of another rare genetic illness called Ogden Syndrome, uses what he calls a ""genotype-first"" approach. It has become increasingly fruitful as the cost of genome sequencing has rapidly declined over the last half decade. In many medical practices in the US and overseas it is now routine to conduct genome scans of children who are observed early in life to be experiencing developmental delays. Although there are many possible causes, one is the mutation of genes that play critical roles in development. In boys, so-called X-linked syndromes are among the logical suspects. They have been firmly associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability, among other symptoms. Girls have 2 copies of the X chromosome, while boys have only one - their other ""sex"" chromosome being a Y. Having two ""X""s, girls have a backup copy if a gene on one of their X chromosomes is mutated. Having only one ""X,"" boys have no backup, so any X-linked mutations have the potential to cause serious biological problems. After finding single-""letter"" DNA mutations within the TAF1 gene in both brothers from Utah, Lyon was encouraged to reach out to colleagues to find boys with similar symptoms, figuring that perhaps they too had telltale X-linked mutations. He attended medical genetics conferences as often as his other obligations permitted, trading notes at these gatherings with other experts in childhood disorders. He posted tweets and an entry about the suspect gene, TAF1, on Wikipedia, hoping to attract others interested. One powerful tool proved to be a website called BioRxiv (""bioarchive""), begun in 2014 by CSHL. There he posted what scientists call a preprint of a paper he hoped to later publish. It detailed the one TAF1 mutation of which he was by then aware in the Utah brothers. This proved a key step in assembling a cohort of similarly ailing children. ""Once our hypothesis and preliminary data were posted to BioRxiv,"" says Lyon, ""we began finding people all over the world we may never have found any other way. I heard from doctors in Colombia, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK."" ""It was very exciting. It was clear we were all on to something and that we could now really do something to help the families affected. Until this point, the family of an affected child would not even have a name for the condition that was causing their loved one to suffer."" Lyon led a team that includes 47 other doctors and scientists who in their paper not only describe characteristic features of the new syndrome, but also offer a hypothesis about how it is caused. They note that the TAF1 gene is affected in every patient, 12 of whom have a mutation in a single DNA letter within the gene, and two of whom have a genome defect called a copy number variation (CNV) affecting the region including TAF1. CNVs are areas of the genome that are either deleted, or in which extra copies of one or more genes appear. Both affected boys with CNVs have extra copies of the TAF1 gene. It is less clear how problems with the gene generate biological problems. Lyon and colleagues note, however, that the TAF1 gene encodes the largest section, or subunit, of a protein called TFIID (TF-TwoD). It is a transcription factor - a molecule that attaches to the double helix and helps to initiate the process, called transcription, by which a gene generates a message instructing a cell to manufacture a specific protein. ""TAF1 is the largest subunit of a transcription factor complex TFIID, which binds to what we call a core promoter a place where it activates transcription. What's fascinating is that when other components of TFIID malfunction, this causes related disease. It is largely unknown how these malfunctions cause disease or how these diseases are related, it really opens up a new area of research for us"", says lead author Jason O'Rawe."" Work on the molecular mechanisms associated with TAF1 mutations and other biological aspects of the new syndrome is sure to continue. For now, however, Lyon says he is pleased to have joined with colleagues to arrive at a point ""where we are able to inform multiple families what is affecting their children, why they are not well.""

The test has been designed to as far as possible mimic a future situation involving treatment of human patients. Many patients with epilepsy are not experiencing any improvements from existing drugs. Surgery can be an alternative for severe epilepsy, in case it is possible to localize and remove the epileptic focus in the brain where seizures arise. ""There is a period between the detection of this focus and the operation when the gene therapy alternative could be tested. If it works well, the patient can avoid surgery. If it doesn't, surgery will go ahead as initially planned and the affected part will then be removed. With this approach, the experimental treatment will be more secure for the patient"", says Professor Merab Kokaia. He and his group are working on a rat model that mimics temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common type of epilepsy. The test animals are given injections of the epilepsy-inducing substance, kainate, in the temporal lobe of one the cerebral hemispheres. Most of the animals had seizures of varying degrees, whereas some had no seizures, which Merab Kokaia considers a good result, as it is similar to the situation among people. Brain damage resulting from various accidents has very different consequences for different patients, as some develop epilepsy, whereas others do not. The rats that developed epilepsy were then given gene therapy in the part of the brain in which the kainate had been injected, and where the seizures arose. Genes were delivered for both the signal substance (neuropeptide Y) and one of its receptors. The idea was that the combination would create a larger effect than only delivering the gene for the signal substance itself. Neuropeptide Y can bind to several different receptors and in the worst case it binds to a receptor that promotes increase in the number of seizures instead of decrease. The study results have so far been positive. The increase in the frequency of seizures that has been seen among the control animals that were treated with inactive genes was halted after the treatment with combination of active genes, and for 80 % of the animals the number of seizures was reduced by almost half. ""The test must be repeated in more animal studies, so that the possible side effects, on memory for example, can be studied. But, we regard this study as promising proof of concept, a demonstration that the method works,"" states Merab Kokaia. He expects that the first gene therapy treatments will be carried out on patients who have already been selected for surgical procedures. In the long term, however, gene therapy will be of the greatest benefit to those patients who cannot be operated on. There are patients with severe epilepsy whose epileptic focus is so badly placed that an operation is out of question since it can impair e.g. speech or movement. These patients can therefore never undergo a surgical procedure, but could be helped by gene therapy in the future. Lund UniversityNikitidou Ledri L et al.

The findings have been published online by the journal Pediatric Research. The research led by principal investigators Bradley S. Peterson, MD, director of the Institute for the Developing Mind at The Saban Research Institute of Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Catherine Monk, PhD, of Columbia University Medical Center indicates the potential significance for the child of even modest changes in maternal dietary health. Dietary iron is required for normal growth and development, and for optimal brain growth in utero. But 35 to 58 percent of healthy women have some degree of iron deficiency, especially in pregnancy. Worldwide, nearly half of pregnant women are anemic, and this severe maternal iron deficiency can have adverse consequences for the developing fetus. Past animal studies have shown that prenatal brain iron deficiency leads to impaired functioning of the hippocampus, adversely affecting learning and memory, and with delayed maturation of white matter in the brain. Consistent with these findings, it has been shown that newborns with a low iron profile lagged in general motor and neurocognitive development. In this study, the researchers looked at the organization of newborn brain tissue using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique. The DTI images taken at an average of 20 days after birth were used to associate maternal iron intake during pregnancy to differences in cortical gray matter and, to a lesser extent, in major axonal pathways within the underlying white matter of the brain. The scientists found that maternal iron intake correlated inversely with fractional anisotropy (FA) a unit of measurement in DTI that is a useful measurement of tissue organization in the brain at locations scattered throughout the gray matter of the brain. This suggests that higher dietary iron intake is associated with greater complexity and therefore greater maturity of cortical gray matter and, conversely, that lower dietary iron is associated with lesser complexity and more immaturity of the developing gray matter shortly after birth. ""These findings are consistent with our expectations,"" said Peterson, who is also a professor of professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. ""Neurons become increasingly more complex in their extensions and connections as the brain matures, and the maturational delays reported previously in animal models and human behavioral studies of iron deficiency would predict that lower iron intake would produce neurons in cortical gray matter that are structurally less complex and more immature. That is what our DTI findings suggest is the case.'"" These correlations were detected in the newborn infants of a sample of 40 healthy adolescent mothers who were adhering to prenatal care and across a range of iron intake. Despite their prenatal care, 14 percent still met clinical criteria for mild anemia, underscoring the health risks in adolescent mothers and their newborn children. Peterson says that the technical nature of MRI brain assessments limited the number of adolescent women and their infants who could be studied, the findings bear further investigation.

Based on new studies of stress responses, this insight may have broad implications for human psychology and for the biology of psychiatric and neurological diseases. A pioneering scientist in mitochondrial medicine has led research in animals showing how alterations in mitochondrial function lead to distinct physiological changes in hormonal, metabolic and behavioral systems in response to mild stress. ""Our findings suggest that relatively mild alterations in mitochondrial genes, and hence mitochondrial physiology, have large effects on how mammals respond to stressful changes in their environment,"" said Douglas C. Wallace, Ph.D., director of the Center for Mitochondrial and Epigenomic Medicine at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ""This has profound implications for the hereditary basis of neuropsychiatric diseases and for the role of stress in human health."" Wallace, who has investigated the genetics of mitochondria and their role in health for over 40 years, has long argued that a traditional biomedical approach focused on anatomy and thus, on the organ exhibiting the most prominent symptoms of a disease, overlooks the key role played by systematic bioenergetics in health. At the core of bioenergetics are the mitochondria, residing in large numbers outside the nucleus of every cell. Mitochondria contain their own DNA, which codes for essential energy genes and which exchanges biological signals with the more familiar DNA housed in the cell nucleus. Those interactions affect physiological networks essential for health. In this current study, the researchers subjected the mice to a standardized psychological stress: placing them in restraint for a brief period. They then measured the effects of this stressor on the animals' neuroendocrine, inflammatory, metabolic and gene transcription systems. In humans, all of these systems are involved in behavioral responses to stress and long-term susceptibility to stress-related diseases. Wallace and colleagues showed that in the mice, relatively mild mutations in mitochondrial genes, located in either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA, produced unique whole-body stress-response signatures, indicated by physiological and gene expression patterns. These differential responses to stress due to mitochondrial variation provide a physiological explanation for a 2012 observation by Wallace's laboratory team. That research, published in Cell, involved mixing two normal but different mtDNAs in a mouse model, thus thwarting the usual strict maternal inheritance of the mitochondrial DNA. Simply mixing those two mtDNAs resulted in hyper-excitable mice with severe learning and memory defects. While researchers have long recognized individual differences in response to environmental cues such as stress, identifying the genetic and physiological basis for these individual differences has eluded scientists. Although he emphasizes that much more research remains to be done on the role of mitochondria on human behavior, Wallace postulates that the current study indicates that an important reason for our limited progress in understanding the genetic and biologic basis of psychology is our lack of appreciation for the importance of systematic alterations in energetic metabolism. ""The brain, constituting only 2 percent of human body weight, consumes 20 percent of the body's energy,"" he said. ""Hence, mild variations in mitochondrial bioenergetics will have significant effects on the brain."" It is well known that frequently activating stress responses can inflict long-term damage in mammals and humans. Under the framework of mind-body connections, stress researchers refer to allostatic load: the cumulative wear and tear on the body that can result in both psychological disorders and human diseases such as diabetes and age-related cognitive decline. As Wallace and associates point out, ""Scientists have long known that stressful experiences, on their own, do not cause disease; it's our responses to stress that have the potential to culminate in disease."" They conclude, ""In this emerging paradigm, mitochondria are at the interface of genetic and environmental factors contributing to disease trajectories."" One implication of this new study, said Wallace, is that identifying the altered mitochondrial states associated with neuropsychiatric diseases may help suggest new therapies. These may permit physicians to more effectively ameliorate the effects of environmental stressors on human health. This could make people more resilient in environmental changes, reduce the long-term burden of stress-related diseases and produce more effective therapies for psychiatric disorders. Wallace concludes, ""While human differences in behavior and its relation to predisposition to mental illness as well as to a wide varied of pediatric and adult neurological diseases has been the subject of intense investigations for over a century, we still have a rudimentary understanding of the physiological, genetic, and environmental factors that mediate mental health and illness. Our recent papers strongly suggest that by reorienting our investigations from the anatomy of the brain and brain-specific genes to the mitochondria and the bioenergetics genes, we may have a more productive conceptual framework to understand neuropsychiatric disease. If so, this will spawn a whole new generation of neuropsychiatric therapeutics.""","Published: December 4, 2015"

But when moist conditions prevail in the vineyard, Botrytis spawns noble rot's evil twin, the so-called ""bunch rot."" Bunch rot is a destructive disease that inflicts severe crop losses in all grape-growing regions worldwide. The UC Davis team found that during noble rot infection, Botrytis induces metabolic processes in white grape berries normally seen only during the ripening of red-skinned grapes. This was a novel observation, because white berries are, in fact, developmental mutants that cannot activate several ripening pathways such as the synthesis of anthocyanins, the molecules that impart the red color in the skin of red grape berries. The research also confirmed that the reprogramming of grape metabolism by Botrytis results in the accumulation of key aroma and flavor compounds that make sweet wines made from botrytized grapes so special. ""This study demonstrates how effective it is to integrate genomics and metabolomics in analyzing the impact of plant-microbe interactions on plant metabolism under field conditions,"" said plant biologist Dario Cantu of the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology. The work also may lead to new approaches to improving quality traits in grapes and other fruit, said Cantu, who led the study along with postdoctoral researcher Barbara Blanco-Ulate. Botrytis has long history in winemaking Winemakers have made use of the beneficial impacts of Botrytis cinerea -- in the form of noble rot -- since the 1500s. For example, white-skinned grape berries, naturally infected with noble rot, have been used to produce some of the world's highest quality dessert wines, referred to as botrytized wines. These wines were first produced in specific regions of Hungary, Germany and France, but now are also made in Italy, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and California. Botrytized wines are valued for their natural sweetness and distinctive flavor and aroma profiles, which include raisin, pineapple, apricot, pear and honey features. Systems biology explains how grape berries change during noble rot In the newly published study, the researchers collected berries of a white-skinned grape variety called Semillon over three years at the same time the grapes were being harvested for winemaking. They then used state-of-the-art RNA sequencing and metabolomics approaches, as well as enzymatic assays, on those grapes to demonstrate that noble rot: * induces grape stress responses involved in generating aroma and flavor metabolites; and * triggers regulators of metabolic pathways that are typically associated with red-skinned grape berry ripening. The researchers also profiled the metabolites of commercial botrytized wines produced from the same vineyard where the grape berries were collected and verified that key compounds that result from noble rot are carried over to the wines.","Published: December 4, 2015"

Craig Venter, who led one of the two teams of scientists that achieved this remarkable feat, said that having access to this information held  the potential to reduce the number of cancer deaths to zero during our lifetimes . And President Bill Clinton claimed that  it is now conceivable that our children s children will know the term cancer as only a constellation of stars . Fifteen years later, you don t need to be a scientist to realise that this isn t quite what has happened. So what went wrong? Are the huge promises made by Venter and others more rhetoric than reality, or is there still hope for personalised medicine? Your genetic code is unique to you, unless you are an identical twin. It specifies exactly why each part of your body is the way it is. But as well as controlling why your hair is brown and not black, variations to your genetic code also determine the risk you have of developing certain diseases, and why you might respond well to some drugs and not others. The publication of the human genome sequence at the turn of the century heralded a new era of medicine, where therapies would be tailored to each person s unique genetic code, making indiscriminate and damaging treatments like chemotherapy a thing of the past. So, if the technology is available to sequence everyone s genome, why don t doctors now ask for a DNA sample as part of a routine diagnosis? Not all junk DNA is rubbish It s because, over a decade after the first draft of the human genome was published, we still really don t have any idea of what most of it actually does. One of the most surprising outcomes of the completion of the first draft of the sequence was that there are far fewer genes than anyone anticipated. In fact, genes make up only 2% of the human genome, with the remaining 98% often dismissed as  junk  DNA. The next surprise came when, after sequencing the genomes of thousands of patients suffering from a variety of genetic disorders, scientists discovered that 88% of changes to the genetic code that correlated with the disease were found in the junk DNA. So now we scientists have a major problem. We can sequence a patient s genome efficiently and economically, we can process the data rapidly, and we can identify changes to the DNA that are associated with the disease in question. But, in most cases, we have no idea how those changes cause the symptoms of the disease. Cracking the code There is now a major drive among researchers in the genomics field to develop tools to address this issue. It is known that one thing harboured in this junk DNA are switches that tell certain genes when and where in the body to turn on (this is why you only have one nose, and don t start sprouting eyes on your elbow). It is also known that many disease-causing changes to your DNA are found within these switches, so that a given gene doesn t turn on or off at the right time, or turns on at the wrong time somewhere in the body where it shouldn t be active. If the gene in question controls how cells grow, the result of the broken switch can be cancer. However, identifying these switches and linking them to the genes they affect is not a trivial task. It requires enormously complex experiments with rare and precious tissue samples donated by patients, and then a vast amount of computing power to sequence, analyse and interpret the results. The Wellcome Trust has just awarded a  3m grant to the institute where I work, the MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Oxford, to process samples of DNA from patients known to have a given genetic disease, identify the changes to the DNA which underlie the condition in question, and try and link these changes to genes which may cause the diseases themselves. With this strategy, we hope to add functionality to the DNA sequence information, and try to work out what that 98% of junk DNA actually does and how it contributes to disease progression. Personalised medicine remains an achievable goal, but this is why the promises made by Venter, when the draft sequence was first published over a decade ago, have yet to be fulfilled. Yes, we can read the human genetic code, but we are a long way from understanding what it means.","Published: December 4, 2015"

For more 30 years, scientists have failed to target Ras, as the protein is known, but now researchers from U of T have  turned this protein off with an experimental drug.  The inhibitors  results were incredible,  said Michael Ohh, a professor in the Faculty of Medicine s department of laboratory medicine and pathobiology.  We were shocked. Nothing has had the same effect.  Normally, Ras promotes cell growth, but it can also cause uncontrolled growth when mutated or deregulated. As a result, this protein is involved in many forms of cancer and is mutated in over 90 per cent of pancreatic tumours   one of the deadliest forms of cancer. The researchers discovered that another protein, called SHP2, turns Ras off.  Our lab is known for another area of cancer biology,  Ohh explained.  But at the request of a colleague, we entered the Ras field about five years ago to study mutations in a rare form of childhood leukemia.  Working with researchers from Indiana University and Toronto s University Health Network, the team tested a SHP2 inhibitor on mice with glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive type of brain cancer. Remarkably, the inhibitor reduced these tumours by over 80 per cent.  We were surprised to find that nobody had identified SHP2 as a switch that regulates Ras,  Ohh said. Next, the team will work with a cancer surgeon at the University of North Carolina to treat mice that have human pancreatic tumours. If the SHP2 inhibitor is effective, the researchers will use this evidence to support human clinical trials.  In addition to being a researcher, I m also a gastroenterologist and I see a lot of patients with pancreatic cancer,  said Dr. Yoshihito Kano, co-author of the publication along with primary author Severa Bunda (who is, like Kano, a postdoctoral fellow).  These patients usually die within one year, even with chemotherapy, so this drug could potentially change lives.  While their research is still in its early stages, Ohh and his team hope that their discovery will open up new perspectives in the field and potentially change cancer treatment.  By understanding how this cancer-causing protein works, we hope to target it much more precisely than before,  said Ohh.  At the end of the day, we want other researchers to build on our fundamental discovery, providing more options for patients. ","Published: December 4, 2015"

The study focuses on interactions of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with their signaling mediators known as G proteins. GPCRs currently accounting for about 40 percent of all prescription pharmaceuticals on the market play key roles in many physiological functions because they transmit signals from outside the cell to the interior. When an outside substance binds to a GPCR, it activates a G protein inside the cell to release components and create a specific cellular response.  Until now, it was generally believed that GPCRs are very selective, activating only a few G proteins they were designed to work with,  said TSRI Associate Professor Kirill Martemyanov, who led the study.  It turns out the reality is much more complex.  Ikuo Masuho, a senior research associate in the Martemyanov lab, added,  Our imaging technology opens a unique avenue of developing drugs that would precisely control complex GPCR-G protein coupling, maximizing therapeutic potency by activating G proteins that contribute to therapeutic efficacy while inhibiting other G proteins that cause adverse side effects.  The study found that individual GPCRs engage multiple G proteins with varying efficacy and rates, much like a dance where the most desirable partner, the GPCR, is surrounded by 14 suitors all vying for attention. The results, as in any dance, depend on which G proteins bind to the receptor and for how long. The same receptor changes G protein partners and the signaling outcome depending on the action of the signal received from outside of the cell. This finding was made possible by novel imaging technology used by the Martemyanov lab to monitor G protein activation in live cells. Using a pair of light-emitting proteins, one attached to the G protein, the other attached to what s known as a reporter molecule, Martemyanov and his colleagues were able to measure simultaneously both the signal and activation rates of most G proteins present in the body.  Our approach looks at 14 different types of G proteins at once and we only have 16 in our bodies,  he said.  This is as close as it can get to what is actually happening in real time.  In the accompanying commentary in Science Signaling, Alan Smrcka, a professor at University of Rochester Medical School and a prominent GPCR researcher, wrote,  [The findings] suggest the power of the GPCR fingerprinting approach, in that it could predict the G protein coupling specificity of a GPCR in a native system, which was previously undetected by conventional analysis. This could be very helpful for identifying previously unappreciated signaling pathways downstream of individual GPCRs that could be useful therapeutically or identified as potential side effects of GPCRs.

After successfully establishing our fill-finish portfolio, we also strengthen our line competence in downstream processes,  says Klaus Ullherr, product manager at Bosch Packaging Technology.  Two steps are required: the rod has to be inserted and the pre-filled syringes have to be inspected. The USD de-nester and the RIL rod insertion and labelling machine are ideal additions to our filling and closing machines, such as the recently launched FXS Combi.  First machine combinations are already in operation in Europe and Asia. Gentle removal and transportationThe syringes filled with liquid pharmaceuticals are either manually or automatically placed on the infeed belt of the de-nester in tubs. Using a gripper, the USD removes the syringes in rows and gently transfers them to a horizontal single-lane transport belt. The products remain in a safe and controlled position at all times. Depending on the model, the USD de-nester achieves an output of up to 400 syringes per minute. In combination with the respective inspection machines for particle and cosmetic inspection as well as leak detection, a ZPS buffer system and a RIL rod insertion and labelling machine, lines for middle and high performance can be implemented. Safety for products, operators and patientsThe high-performance machines of the RIL series accomplish exact and gentle rod insertion, and provide for reliable labelling of the syringes. First, the transport belt transfers the syringes to a segment wheel, which ensures that screwing in of the rod is done at optimum conditions in standstill mode. A separate sorting device conveys the rods to a star wheel, which positions the rods and inserts them accurately into the rubber stoppers. The torque control makes sure that the stoppers do not move. In the next step, the segment wheel transfers the syringes to the labelling station, where the labels are applied and checked with a control sensor. A number of additional options are available to read out label data or inspect the quality, readability and coding of the labels. To ensure optimum product and operator safety as well as high product quality, the RIL models are equipped with a tip closure control, which checks the presence of the protecting cap on the injection needle. All defect syringes are conveyed to a customer-specific reject station via a star wheel. After rod insertion, labelling and inspection, the processed syringes can be additionally equipped with a backstopper on the RIL. Designed for patient safety and ease of use, the stopper prevents the plunger head from being pulled out of the syringe and also broadens the finger flange. First machine combinations in operation The downstream equipment is an important part of our line competence for syringes,  says Klaus Ullherr.  The new models meet the requirements in the European, as well as in the growing Asian market. Our specialists have already delivered, installed and put into operation several machines together with our customers.  Further steps for a consequent portfolio expansion are in the planning stage, such as the integration of so-called safety devices for syringes.","Published: December 4, 2015"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-to-wake-a-sleeping-cancer-cell-197290,How to Wake a Sleeping Cancer Cell  Cancer cells that lie  snoozing  in the skeleton can be awakened   or left to slumber on   by changes in the bone that surrounds them  Australian scientists have shown   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In a world first, researchers from the Garvan Institute of Medical Research have used state-of-the-art microscopy techniques to watch cancer cells sleep within living bone over a period of months. They show that cancer cells can be 'woken up' when bone tissue is broken down around them, suggesting new possibilities for treating metastatic cancer in bone. In several cancers (including breast and prostate), cancer cells can spread from the original tumour site into bone. Once there, they settle in 'for the long haul', remaining inactive for months or even many years. Eventually, though, some of these cells can 'wake up' and begin dividing, forming secondary cancers (or metastases) in bone and dramatically worsening the prognosis of cancer patients. ""Once a cancer spreads to bone, it becomes notoriously difficult to treat,"" says Professor Peter Croucher, Head of Garvan's Bone Biology Division and the study's lead investigator. ""So, it's important to establish exactly what wakes those cells in bone. Is it some signal within the cells themselves, or is it a change in their environment?""You could compare it to how we ourselves wake in the morning. Some of us wake naturally, but others need an external signal, whether it's an alarm clock or sunshine streaming through the window."" The research team set out to discover which scenario holds true for cancer cells in bone.  Using a groundbreaking technique called intravital two-photon microscopy, the researchers tracked the fate of sleeping cancer cells in the tibia (the main bone in the long part of the leg) of a living mouse. They introduced cells from multiple myeloma (a cancer of blood cells that arises in bone) into the mouse, and watched as a small number of the cells lodged in the tibia and 'went to sleep'. These vanishingly rare sleeping cells could be detected because they contained a fluorescent dye that was lost rapidly from dividing (wakeful) cells. Dr Tri Phan, who co-led the study, says, ""Because we were looking at a long bone like a tibia (rather than the skull, which is more commonly studied), we could watch the same sleeping cancer cells, in the same bone, in the same mouse, over a long period of time - and this is something that hasn't been done before."" Prof Croucher says that studying the same set of cells over a period of months gave vital clues about what caused them to reactivate. ""Because we've done it this way, we can show that there are a great many dormant cells - yet only some of them get woken up, and those that do wake, wake at different times. We even saw some cells that woke then went back to sleep again. ""The fact that these myeloma cells behave so differently, despite coming from the same cancer cell line, gave us our first clue that it is a signal from outside the cells that is controlling when they wake."" The next challenge was to work out the precise nature of the 'wake-up call' from bone. Dr Michelle McDonald, a bone biologist on the research team, says, ""In this study, we've shown that bone's dynamic process of building up and breaking down can send signals to cancer cells to stay sleeping or to wake. ""Cells known as 'osteoblasts' are known to help build new bone, while 'osteoclast' cells break down bone. ""We were able to show that myeloma cells are usually kept asleep by close association with a layer of osteoblast-like cells, called bone-lining cells, in the endosteum (an internal surface within bone). The bone-lining cells are essentially inactive, so we can think of them as providing a quiet environment in which myeloma cells sleep undisturbed. ""Crucially, we can wake those myeloma cells by activating osteoclasts, which break down bone tissue. We think the osteoclasts are physically changing the local environment of the cancer cells and waking them up in the process - as if they were literally throwing them out of bed. ""We know that bone remodelling is going on in all of us - so a myeloma cell could be woken in an essentially random fashion, by having its local environment remodelled by osteoclasts. Essentially, a cancer cell could be woken by being in the wrong place at the wrong time."" What does this mean for treating secondary cancers in bone? Prof Croucher says, ""Now we can see that the cancer cells are woken by changes in the surrounding bone, we can think in a whole new way about treating bone metastasis - and there are two treatment approaches in particular that have promise. ""The first is that we could inhibit the breakdown of bone by osteoclasts so as to keep cancer cells in long-term hibernation. In fact, there are already drugs that can do this, such as bisphosphonates (used to protect bone in individuals with osteoporosis), and there's already evidence that these drugs do improve survival in breast cancer patients. ""The other, more radical, option is to do the opposite - to wake the sleeping cells by activating osteoclasts and driving the breakdown of bone. Most cancer treatments target active, dividing cells, so waking the sleeping cells should make them susceptible to those therapies - and, ultimately, could eradicate any residual disease.""

It s based on the content in fingerprints   specifically amino acids. According to known literature, amino acid levels in the sweat of females are about twice as high as in males. There s also a slightly different distribution, due mostly to hormonal differences. The same is true for amino acids left behind in fingerprints. Hal mek s research team has devised a simple method to back up these claims. As a starting point, Hal mek s team extracts amino acids from a fingerprint by transferring it onto a piece of plastic wrap. A hydrochloric acid solution is then placed onto the fingerprint, followed by heating. This process allows for the water-soluble amino acids to migrate into the acidic solution. From there, the team can easily view amino acid levels, distinguishing sex. Hal mek and his colleagues first tested this method on  mimicked fingerprint samples,  which they found to have a 99 percent accuracy of correct sex classification. From there, they set up a real crime scene scenario. Three female volunteers placed their fingerprints on five different surfaces, including a doorknob and a computer screen. Regardless of the surface type, Hal mek s team found it was possible to tell the fingerprint belonged to a woman.  One of the main goals for this project was to move toward looking at the chemical content within the fingerprint, as opposed to relying on simply the fingerprint image,  Hal mek said.  We do not intend to compete with DNA analysis or the databases used for identification. Insteadwe are aiming at differentiating between demographic groups, and more importantly, we are aiming at making use of fingerprints that are smudged/distorted or that don t have an existing match.  According to Hal mek, this is only the beginning of his research. He s currently in the process of developing additional identification methods for other forensically-relevant attributes, as well as improving on the current fingerprint concept.","Published: December 4, 2015"

Today s population is taller, heavier and matures earlier than older populations, which means that the odds of identifying someone using those methods is less likely,  Stull said.  Hopefully we will increase identification of unidentified sub-adults with the success of this grant.  The department will collect 2,500 multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) scans from medical examiners offices in Albuquerque and Baltimore. Multi-slice computed tomography is a type of advanced imaging technique that takes many cross-sectional  slices  or images of the body. This enables anthropologists and, primarily, clinicians, to see the internal elements without needing to do any cutting or require a body donation. The sample includes individuals from birth to 25 years of age.  Because forensic anthropologists require large sample sizes from modern populations and our body donation programs do not grow or change at the same rate as the larger population, using MSCT images allows us to obtain a large sample,  Stull said. Currently in biological and forensic anthropology, there is no appropriate method to estimate age and sex of an unknown individual in the United States that is younger than approximately 20 years of age. The previous techniques were developed from antiquated samples, which are not appropriate for modern populations. Co-principal investigators are at Mercyhurst University. Stull applied for the grant in April 2015, and the grant will run from Jan.1 to Dec. 31, 2017. ISU was one of 60 schools to receive the federal funding. The total amount of money distributed was about $29 million.  We were up against all other fields in forensic sciences,  Stull said.","Published: December 4, 2015"

""We isolated four distinct circulating tumor cell subsets, one of which marks genes known to be directly implicated in tumor cell dormancy,"" said Dario Marchetti, PhD, director of the Biomarker Research Program at the Houston Methodist Research Institute. ""This is a significant step forward to better understanding the mechanisms of CTCs in clinical breast cancer dormancy, and a first step in deciphering why breast cancer or metastatic breast cancer recurs in patients decades after resection of the primary tumor."" Even after a primary tumor is surgically removed, breast cancer cells can remain clinically dormant for 20 years or more. While treating breast cancer metastatic disease would be more effective for long-term patient survival, these scattered cells are often undetectable by traditional clinical tools. Researchers from Houston Methodist Research Institute, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine report their findings in the journal Scientific Reports. The CTC subsets isolated by Marchetti and his colleagues were cells that (1) did not express a protein known as epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), and (2) either did or did not express a combination of proteins known as urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and beta-1 integrin ( 1int). ""We found that EpCAM negative and uPAR/ 1int positive CTCs were detected in the blood of patients whose breast cancer had metastasized to the brain, while the EpCAM positive and uPAR/ 1int negative cells did not,"" Marchetti said. ""Moreover, we didn't see any CTCs that were EpCAM positive in these patients. Therefore, we concluded that uPAR/ 1int expression along with EpCAM negativity may be key for allowing or controlling breast cancer recurrence to the brain."" However, Marchetti said the team was unable to induce breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) clusters of CTCs made from the EpCAM negative, uPAR/ 1int expressing cells they isolated. ""This was likely due to the difficulty of growing CTCs in large enough quantities to properly mimic the course of breast cancer progression,"" he explained. ""We have gained a tremendous amount of information about CTCs from the ones grown in our lab, and we can use this knowledge to develop tests for detecting these cells early and customizing treatments against them."" Marchetti said upcoming studies will try to better comprehend the mechanisms responsible for both BCBM and dormancy, as well as the importance of uPAR/ 1int in defining biomarkers for both states. Then they can determine if blocking the expression of uPAR/ 1int leads to tumor dormancy. ""We are uniquely positioned to perform this research because of our access to an extensive cohort of blood samples from patients diagnosed with and without BCBM, along with the availability of multiple CTC technologies and human CTC lines that our lab was the first to develop,"" he said.

These findings, published in Pyschosomatic Medicine, represent one of the largest reported impacts of depression on cancer survival. Although depression can have obvious detrimental effects on an individual's quality of life, the impact on that of cancer patients is becoming more apparent, explained Eileen Shinn, PhD, assistant professor, Behavioral Science, MD Anderson, and lead author of the study. There is increasing evidence for modest associations between elevated symptoms of depression and increased mortality risk in lung, breast, ovarian and kidney cancer. To clarify the influence of depression on survival, the research team focused their analysis on a single cancer type. By limiting the sample set and adjusting for factors known to affect outcome, such as age, tumor size and previous chemotherapy, they were able to uncover a more profound effect of depression. The researchers followed 130 MD Anderson patients newly diagnosed with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a type of head and neck cancer in which the tumor originates at the back of the throat and base of the tongue. At the beginning of their radiation therapy, patients completed a validated questionnaire to identify those with symptoms of clinical depression. Researchers monitored the participants, all of whom completed treatment, until their last clinic visit or death, a median period of five years. ""The results of this study were quite intriguing, showing depression was a significant factor predicting survival at five years, even after controlling for commonly accepted prognostic factors,"" said senior author Adam Garden, M.D., professor, Radiation Oncology. In fact, depression was the only factor shown to have a significant impact on survival. Patients scoring as depressed on the questionnaire were three-and-one-half times less likely to have survived to the five-year interval, compared to those who were not depressed on this scale. The degree of depression was also found to be significant, as every unit increase on this scale resulted in a 10 percent higher risk for reduced survival. The results were replicated with a different psychological health survey and were not influenced by how soon following diagnosis the depression assessment was done. According to the authors, OSCC is diagnosed in 10,000-15,000 Americans each year. Several major risk factors are known to be associated with OSCC, including smoking and tobacco use, alcohol consumption and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. In fact, the incidence of OSCC has doubled in the last 20 years due to rising HPV infection rates, said Shinn. Neither alcohol nor tobacco use, also surveyed in this group, had a significant impact on survival. HPV infection status, when available, did not appear correlated either. Despite a high cure rate for OSCC, normally between 60-80 percent, there is an unusually high rate of recurrence in these patients of about 30 percent. As depression was connected to survival, the researchers also investigated a potential link to disease recurrence. ""When we controlled for all variables, depression was linked with a nearly four times higher risk of recurrence,"" said Shinn. ""Also, those who had never smoked, compared to current smokers, had a 73 percent lower chance of recurrence."" Those were the only two factors associated with cancer recurrence. While the researchers stress caution in generalizing these results to other cancer types, the results do suggest an important role for depression in influencing OSCC patient outcome. Although the current study does not address potential psychotherapy interventions, screening for depression in this population may be appropriate, explained Shinn. ""Regardless of depression's impact on cancer outcome, all patients should seek help for prolonged and elevated levels of depression as effective medications and therapeutic options are available,"" said Shinn. Looking ahead, the researchers would like not only to replicate the findings in a larger sample but also to determine the biological reason depression makes this cancer more lethal. Possible mechanisms include poor lifestyle behaviors associated with depression, or a different biological response to chronic inflammation that affects cancer biology. These questions, however, will need to be answered in future research. University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center  press release Shinn E et al. Depression and Oropharynx Cancer Outcome.

However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not clear. A new study, published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, reports that ?9-THC increases random neural activity, termed neural noise, in the brains of healthy human subjects. The findings suggest that increased neural noise may play a role in the psychosis-like effects of cannabis.  At doses roughly equivalent to half or a single joint, ?9-THC produced psychosis-like effects and increased neural noise in humans,  explains senior author Dr. Deepak Cyril D Souza, a Professor of Psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine.  The dose-dependent and strong positive relationship between these two findings suggest that the psychosis-like effects of cannabis may be related to neural noise which disrupts the brain s normal information processing,  added first author Dr. Jose Cortes-Briones, a Postdoctoral Associate in Psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine. The investigators studied the effects of ?9-THC on electrical brain activity in 24 human subjects who participated in a three-day study during which they received two doses of intravenous ?9-THC or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over, and counterbalanced design. If confirmed, the link between neural noise and psychosis could shed light on the biology of some of the symptoms associated with schizophrenia.  This interesting study suggests a commonality between the effects on the brain of the major active ingredient in marijuana and symptoms of schizophrenia,  stated Dr. John Krystal, Editor of Biological Psychiatry.  The impairment of cortical function by ?9-THC could underlie some of the cognitive effects of marijuana. Not only does this finding aid our understanding of the processes underlying psychosis, it underscores an important concern in the debate surrounding medical and legalized access to marijuana.

The team of researchers, led by Dr. Neda Bernasconi, a neuroscientist specializing in the neuroimaging of epilepsy and co-founder of the Neuroimaging of Epilepsy Laboratory (NOEL) at The Neuro, set out to build and share a detailed model of the substructures making up one of the key centers of the brain involved in epilepsy: the hippocampus. The goal of their project, published in Scientific Data, is to improve the tools available to researchers and clinicians working in the field around the globe. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by a sudden, brief change in the brain, expressed as a seizure. According to Epilepsy Canada, approximately one percent of Canadians suffer from the condition and more than 30% of patients with epilepsy do not respond to anti-epileptic drugs. For these individuals, the surgical removal of the brain tissue causing seizures is the only known effective treatment for controlling the condition and improving quality of life. In order to compile this hippocampal atlas, researchers used MRI imagery from a sample of 25 healthy individuals. They then used their expertise in brain anatomy to label all the substructures composing the region, providing a model of an average, healthy hippocampus. The end result is analogous to a Google street view of this particular part of the brain. With this tool, researchers will be better able to assess the pathology of their patients by comparing their data to the atlas and will more clearly be able to locate the areas in need of surgical intervention. ""Our primary purpose was epilepsy. We wanted to be able to detect and identify different substructures in the hippocampus to enable us to be a lot more precise in our diagnosis and to pinpoint the affected region to better target treatments"", said Dr. Bernasconi. ""With this new submillimetric dataset, made available through open science, we are not just sharing MRI images, we are also transferring anatomical knowledge and providing a statistical map that can be used by researchers and clinicians of different levels of expertise anywhere in the world."" These tools hold promising therapeutic implications for epilepsy, but also for other neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and depression. Crucially, the atlas provides researchers with a non-invasive way to assess the impact of therapies targeting this region of the brain and to thus develop better treatments to improve the quality of life for their patients.

Using newly developed tools for manipulating specific populations of neurons, the researchers have for the first time observed direct evidence of synaptic plasticity changes in the strength of connections between neurons in the fruit fly brain while flies are learning.  We showed something that people have been hoping to see for a long time,  says the team leader, CSHL Associate Professor Glenn Turner,  and we showed it quite definitively.  The results appear in the journal Neuron. Due to the relative simplicity of fruit fly neural anatomy there are just two synapses separating odor-detecting antenna from an olfactory-memory brain center called the mushroom body the diminutive insects have provided a powerful model organism for studying learning.  Historically, researchers have monitored neurons in the mushroom body, as well as others to which they send signals, using a technique called calcium imaging. This approach enabled previous researchers to observe changes in neural activity that accompany learning. However this technique doesn t reveal precisely how the electrical activity of the neurons is modified, since calcium is not the only ion involved in neuronal signaling.  Additionally, it was unclear how the changes that had been seen were related to the behavior of the animal.  Turner and colleagues at CSHL and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Janelia Research Campus were able to zoom in to a particularly important part of the fly brain where they were able to connect neural activity to behavior. Toshihide Hige, the lead author of the paper, used his expertise in electrophysiological recordings to directly examine changes in synaptic strength at this site.  The researchers exposed fruit flies to a specific test odor and a very short time later subjected them to an artificial aversive cue. To do so they fired tiny beams of laser light at dopamine-releasing neurons in the mushroom body that were genetically engineered to become active in response to the light. Just like our own neurons, dopamine-releasing neurons in the fly are involved in reward and punishment.  Presenting the smell of cherries, for example, which is normally an attractive odor to flies, while at the same time stimulating a particular dopamine neuron, trains the fly to avoid cherry odor,  Turner explains. In addition to the dopamine neurons, the team identified neurons that represented the test odor and neurons that represented the flies  behavioral response to that odor. These neurons are connected to each other, while the dopamine neurons, which represent the punishment signal, modulate that connection. The team then made recordings of the neurons representing the behavior. This enabled them to discover any changes to the synaptic inputs those neurons received from the odor-representing neurons before and after learning. Strikingly, the team found a dramatic reduction in the synaptic inputs upon subsequent presentations of the test odor, but not control odors. This drop reflected the decrease in the attractiveness of the odor that resulted from the learning.  The average drop in synaptic strength was around 80 percent that s huge,  says Turner. In future studies, Turner plans to exploit powerful tools available for studying fruit fly genetics to better understand the genetic components of learning.  We now have a way of investigating synaptic changes with genetic tools to identify molecules involved in learning and really understand the phenomenon at a level that bridges molecular and physiological mechanisms,  he says.   That mechanistic level of understanding is going to be really important,  he adds.

Chemotherapy for breast cancer is often associated with cognitive problems in patients. However, it is unclear whether certain regimens are associated with greater cognitive difficulties than others. Shelli R. Kesler, PhD, of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, and Douglas W. Blayney, MD, of the Stanford University School of Medicine, California, compared the effects of anthracycline and nonanthracycline chemotherapy regimens on cognitive status and functional brain connectivity in a small study. The authors used cognitive tests and imaging data from 62 primary breast cancer survivors (average age nearly 55) who were, on average, more than two years off therapy to examine cognitive status and functional brain connectivity. Of the women, 20 received anthracycline-based chemotherapy as part of their primary treatment, 19 received nonanthracycline regimens and 23 did not receive any chemotherapy. Women treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy had lower verbal memory, including immediate recall and delayed recall, compared with the other two groups of women. The anthracycline regimens also were associated with lower default mode brain network connectivity, suggesting a decreased efficiency of information processing, according to the study. Patient-reported outcomes of cognitive dysfunction and psychological distress were elevated in both groups of women treated with chemotherapy compared with patients treated without chemotherapy, the results indicate. ""These results should be considered preliminary given the study limitations of small sample size and retrospective, cross-sectional design, Larger, prospective studies are needed that include pretreatment and posttreatment assessments so that patients' individual cognitive and neurobiologic trajectories can be evaluated with respect to potential ANTHR [anthracycline]-related neurotoxic effects,"" the study concludes.

Scientists have come to understand much about this internal time-keeping system, but one important aspect, its complex response to temperature, remains enigmatic. The reason is that while warming and cooling cause the clock to shift forward or backward, they cannot shorten or lengthen its 24-hour cycle. New research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, explores how this is possible.  Our research suggests an explanation: The internal gears within the clock the cyclical activity of genes and concentrations of proteins do not change with temperature, so the length of the cycle stays the same,  says senior author Eric Siggia, Viola Ward Brinning and Elbert Calhoun Brinning Professor at Rockefeller s Center for Studies in Physics and Biology.  Meanwhile, the core mechanisms of the clock appear to be linked to external pathways that are sensitive to temperature. This external coupling can cue the clock to skip ahead or backward,  Siggia says. This study is the result of a collaboration between Siggia s lab and Michael W. Young s Laboratory of Genetics. It builds upon growing evidence calling into question a model that has, for decades, been used to explain temperature-induced shifts. In recent decades, researchers have uncovered the genetic processes that drive the clocks of many different species. In fruit flies, for example, a pair of proteins called Period and Timeless are transcribed from their genes, and after a series of steps, eventually repress their own production. This cycle takes approximately 24 hours, regardless of the temperature at which an organism lives. This makes the circadian clock an oddity, since temperature alters the rate at which most biological processes take place. For decades, the dominant explanation for 24-hour period s independence from temperature, a phenomenon known as temperature compensation, relied on the heat-sensitivity of the chemical reactions that run the time-keeping cycle. According to this theory, the effects of temperature on the many chemical reactions in the circadian cycle cancel each other out, leaving the period unaffected by changes in temperature. But increasingly, studies have suggested something else is going on. For example, a 2010 study showed that in fruit flies whose protective heat and stress response has been inhibited, the clock hardly shifts with temperature changes. Since the conventional model predicts that everything is temperature sensitive, no single pathway should be this influential. Previous work in Siggia s lab suggested an alternative explanation. The investigators used computational tools to simulate the evolution of gene networks, including a model of the circadian clock. Their findings suggested that temperature-induced shifts of the clock involve genetic pathways separate from the molecular cycles at the core of the clock, but linked to them, and that the core clock is actually insensitive to temperature. The recent study s lead author, Philip Kidd, a postdoc in the labs of Siggia and Young, set out to test this hypothesis. Using a conceptual model and molecular experiments in flies, he examined how the oscillations of individual components of the clock, such as concentrations of the protein Timeless, changed with temperature.  If our prediction is correct, and the core mechanism of the clock does not respond to temperature, then the fluctuations in a particular component at different temperatures should remain proportional to one another that is, we should be able to rescale them so they align,  Kidd says.  And when we examined the transcription rate of Timeless, as well as its subsequent levels at three temperatures, that was precisely what we found.  Meanwhile, in a fly with a mutation that allows the length of the clock s period to change with temperature, the curves describing fluctuations in Timeless at the three temperatures shifted around and changed shapes, and were no longer proportional, confirming the premise of Siggia s earlier model.  The mechanism by which the clock can partially ignore temperature has remained a key problem for those of us seeking to understand how it functions. Our work, and that of others, points to a general system that could explain this mystery and lead to a comprehensive understanding of these clocks,  says Young, a study co-author and the Richard and Jeanne Fisher Professor.Rockefeller University   press release Kidd PB, Young MW, Siggia ED.

New research by behavioral neuroscientists Michael Steinman, Brian Trainor and colleagues at UC Davis suggests oxytocin may have different effects in men and women and in certain circumstances the hormone may actually trigger anxiety. In a series of experiments at the UC Davis Department of Psychology, the team administered doses of oxytocin with a nasal spray to male and female mice. Some of the mice were bullied by an aggressive mouse, an experience that reduces motivation to associate with unfamiliar mice. Consistent with previous studies, oxytocin increased the motivation for social interaction in stressed males. However, in stressed females, oxytocin had no effect. When non-stressed females received oxytocin, social motivation was reduced. This effect of oxytocin is similar to the effect of social stress.  Reduced social motivation can be part of a depression-like syndrome,  said Trainor, an associate professor of psychology. Trainor and colleagues found important differences in how stress affected the production of oxytocin. After stress, nerve cells in the brain produced more oxytocin in females but not in males. Steinman used a molecular marker to show that these oxytocin-producing cells were also more active in females that experienced stress. Steinman suggests,  This may help explain why oxytocin nasal spray makes females avoid social contact even though they did not experience social stress.  Clinical studies have found that women with depression or PTSD have elevated oxytocin levels. Usually this result has been thought to reflect an increased drive for social support. The results of Trainor and colleagues suggest an alternate possibility.  Our results show that stressed females have both reduced social motivation and increased oxytocin. It s possible that oxytocin might contribute to a depression-like syndrome in females,  Trainor said.  If correct, inhibiting oxytocin action might have unanticipated benefits.  The surrounding environment also influenced the effects of oxytocin. If mice were tested in a familiar home cage instead of a new environment, oxytocin reduced stress-related behaviors in males and females. This finding shows that the effects of oxytocin depend whether the environment is familiar or unfamiliar. Trainor said his lab s findings have implications for studies investigating the utility of oxytocin as a therapeutic.  Most clinical studies investigating oxytocin as a treatment for depression or anxiety include only males,  he said.  It s important to include both men and women in these studies. The effect of oxytocin may be different if administered by an unfamiliar person or by a person with whom the patient has a personal relationship.

The presynaptic terminal stores vesicles containing neurotransmitters, while the postsynaptic terminal contains neurotransmitter receptors. A dense collection of proteins is present in these terminals, however the functional role of many of these proteins remains unknown. In particular, the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting proteins (GITs) exert a critical control in synaptic transmission, since deletions of these proteins are lethal or cause sensory deficits and cognitive impairments in mice. In particular, GIT proteins and the pathways they regulate have been implicated in neurological disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Huntington's disease. Several studies have demonstrated the role of GITs in the postsynaptic terminal, but very little is known about their role in the presynaptic terminal.

The advance here is that we have a drug-delivery technique that may enhance the effectiveness of the drugs being delivered, can help doctors locate tumors, can be produced in bulk, and appears to be wholly biodegradable with very low toxicity,  says Zhen Gu, corresponding author of a  paper on the work and an assistant professor in the joint biomedical engineering program at NC State and UNC-CH.  And one of the advantages of this technique is that these liquid metal drug carriers   or  nano-terminators    are very easy to make.  To create the nano-terminators, researchers place the bulk liquid metal (gallium indium alloy) into a solution that contains two types of molecules called polymeric ligands. The solution is then hit with ultrasound, which forces the liquid metal to burst into nanoscale droplets approximately 100 nanometers in diameter. The ligands in the solution attach to the surface of the droplets as they break away from the bulk liquid metal. Meanwhile, an oxidized  skin  forms on the surface of the nanodroplets. The oxidized skin, together with the ligands, prevents the nanodroplets from fusing back together.The anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox) is then introduced into the solution. One of the ligands on the nanodroplet sucks up the Dox and holds on to it. These drug-laden nanodroplets can then be separated from the solution and introduced into the bloodstream. The second type of ligand on the nanodroplets effectively seeks out cancer cells, causing receptors on the surface of the cancer cell to latch on to the nanodroplets. The cancer cell then absorbs the nanodroplets. Once absorbed, the higher level of acidity inside the cancer cell dissolves the oxidized skin of the nanodroplets. This releases the ligands, which will go on to release the Dox inside the cell.  Without the oxidized skin and ligands, the nanodroplets fuse together, forming larger drops of liquid metal,  says Michael Dickey, a co-author on this paper and professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at NC State.  These larger droplets are fairly easy to detect using diagnostic techniques, which can potentially help doctors locate tumors.  Meanwhile, the liquid metal continues reacting with the acidic environment in the cancer cell and dissolves, releasing gallium ions. Interestingly, these gallium ions enhance the performance of anticancer drugs   including their effectiveness against drug-resistant cell lines. In addition, this process gradually degrades the metal, minimizing long-term toxicity.  Based on in vitro tests, we believe the liquid metal degrades completely in a matter of days into a form that the body can successfully absorb or filter out, without notable toxic effects,  says Yue Lu, a Ph.D. student in Gu s lab. The researchers have tested the liquid metal technique in a mouse model, and found that it is significantly more effective than Dox alone at inhibiting the growth of ovarian cancer tumors. Importantly, the researchers tracked the mice for up to 90 days, and found no signs of toxicity related to the liquid metal.  This was a proof-of-concept study, but very encouraging,  Gu says.  Like the fictional Terminator, this carrier is transformable: smashed from bulk material, fused inside cancer cells and eventually degraded and cleared. We are hoping to do additional testing in a large animal study to get closer to potential clinical trials. ","Published: December 3, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/growing-stem-cells-faster-on-seaweed-196537,Growing Stem Cells Faster on Seaweed Fraunhofer scientists use the gel like mass from Chilean seaweed as the substrate for stem cells   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. For the drug tests of the future, the pharma industry needs large quantities of pluripotent stem cells. These stem cells have the potential to transform themselves into any kind of somatic cell, such as the cells of inner organs. Many thousands of stem cell lines from a huge variety of patients are currently being built up in biobanks, where doctors can access perfect models of the genetic illnesses of these patients. Using these stem cells, doctors and pharmaceutical companies can test new drugs better and more quickly than before. Scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Biomedical Engineering IBMT in Sulzbach have identified seaweed from Chile as a particularly efficient source of nutrients for the expansion of pluripotent stem cells. Over the past few years, they have developed a controlled and documented production process for alginate, the seaweed s supporting structure. The process encompasses everything from harvesting the seaweed on Chilean beaches and in the seas off Chile, to importing the granulated and dried seaweed, to manufacturing the alginate and using it in cell culture to grow pluripotent stem cells at the institute in Saarland. British pharma companies are currently validating the process in their laboratories.  The first concrete trials with partners from the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) are planned for next year,  says Prof. Heiko Zimmermann, Managing Head of Fraunhofer IBMT.  The goal is to demonstrate that we can use the process to produce stable pluripotent stem cells. At the institute, we ve already managed to do just that for many individual stem cell lines.  The Fraunhofer scientists at Sulzbach developed the production process and the technology platform jointly with their colleagues in Chile and the United Kingdom. Alginate from two Chilean seaweed types particularly suitable Two seaweed species that grow on the coast of Chile form the source material: Lessonia trabeculata and Lessonia nigrescens. Supporting structures in the cell walls of the seaweed are made of alginate, which is particularly suitable for stem cell cultivation: it consists of a highly aqueous gel that is more viscous than honey. When cross-linked with calcium or barium, it is both stable and flexible   like the jello you find in your dessert bowl   and also permeable for nutrients and important factors.  Cells feel especially at home in elastic 3D environments such as are found inside the body. It s precisely this environment that can be simulated perfectly using alginate,  explains Prof. Zimmermann. This is an ideal environment particularly for heart muscle cells, which contract regularly. The scientists flexibly set the elasticity through the mixture of seaweed species and produce the alginate in beads of any size.  After all, different cells need different culture conditions,  says Prof. Zimmermann.  We also introduce active ingredients into the alginate and release them in a controlled manner.  Examples of such ingredients are substances that transform pluripotent stem cells into certain somatic cells.  In the future,  continues Prof. Zimmermann,  the alginate will not only act as a passive substrate, but will also actively influence the growth of the stem cells.  The absence of autofluorescence in the elastic biomass is a further advantage and is important for optical analysis techniques.  The stem cells grow better on our alginate   and particularly well in automated bioreactors. They differentiate better into the desired somatic cells than on the plastic substrates generally used today,  says Prof. Zimmermann. Harvesting the seaweed is subject to rigorous controls: there are special licenses for Chilean fishers, who harvest only the seaweed that is suitable for manufacturing the alginate, and only as much as permits sustainable resource management on the Chilean coast. In a laboratory operated by IBMT and Fraunhofer Chile at UCN University in Coquimbo, the seaweed is individually peeled, shredded, and completely dried. This is all done within 24 hours to prevent the material from becoming contaminated. The seaweed granulate is then exported to Germany, where IBMT scientists separate out the alginate in the institute s cleanroom. After this process, it is available in liquid form and can be shaped into beads using a strong jet of air.  The beads are rendered more stable in a barium bath, as barium tends to remain in the seaweed mass. The trick is to make the material stable, but not too hard,  says Prof. Zimmermann. The researchers place the protein-coated alginate into a bioreactor, which provides the optimum temperature and CO2 environment and continuously stirs the nutrients and cells. Measuring around 200 micrometers, each individual alginate bead performs the role of a Petri dish. The stem cells grow over the alginate in the containers in three to seven days, propagating as they do so.  Because the alginate volumes in the reactors can be increased slightly, we can grow pluripotent stem cells in greater quantities and in smaller spaces,  says Prof. Zimmermann","Published: December 3, 2015"

Now, researchers led by UCLA s Amy Rowat have developed a screening method that utilizes this information to classify many more different types of cancer cells and that could ultimately lead to better treatments for cancer, diabetes, malaria and other diseases. Cancer cells are generally two to five times squishier than normal cells, with a pliability similar to that of a wobbly Jell-O, said Rowat, senior author of the research and an assistant professor of integrative biology and physiology.  We want to screen cells based on their squishiness or stiffness,  said Rowat, who is also a member of UCLA s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.  We created a technology to probe the deformability of hundreds of cell samples at the same time, so we can identify compounds that make the cells stiffer. Our hope is that we can identify new compounds that can help to prevent the spread of cancer.  Rowat calls the approach the parallel microfiltration method, or PMF. Researchers place a mixture of cells and liquid on a porous membrane, and apply air pressure to force the mixture down through tiny pores that have a smaller circumference than the cells. Stiffer cells block the pores so that not much liquid can filter through; for squishier cells, more of the cell-and-liquid mixture passes through. Researchers can use parallel microfiltration to test many different small molecules at once by measuring the filtration of fluid into individual compartments.  The team found that drug-resistant human ovarian cancer cells are softer than their drug-sensitive counterparts, and that more-invasive cancer cells are softer than less-invasive ones. In future research, Rowat hopes to establish whether squishier cancer cells are in fact more harmful than stiffer cancer cells, and whether their softness can be reversed.  It s easy to imagine softer cells can spread more easily through the body to invade distant tissues, but this is still a hypothesis,  she said. Some chemotherapy drugs make cancer cells stiffer because they help to stop cells from dividing, Rowat added. But it isn t clear whether this stiffening of the cells is a key mechanism for preventing the spread of cancer or simply a byproduct of the cells being blocked from dividing. Parallel microfiltration may also have broader applications, including the ability to screen molecules that can alter particular genes and protein levels inside a cell, which could be useful in treating a variety of other diseases, Rowat said.","Published: December 3, 2015"

This also explains why we do not constantly get ill despite the viruses around us. Fever, sore muscles and other influenza-like symptoms are typical signs that your immune system is fighting against viruses and bacteria. The unpleasant condition is, among other things, due to the body forming a substance called interferon, which must defeat the virus. For many years researchers and doctors have assumed that this was the body's earliest response when attacked by various infections. But new research shows that the body's very first defence mechanism is not interferon, but rather a hitherto unknown mechanism, which begins working even earlier. The newly discovered immune reaction is activated when the body s mucous membranes are disrupted, as they are when viruses and bacteria attempt to establish an infection. The immune system recognises the virus and produces a substance that neutralises the uninvited guest. The process goes on continuously without us being aware of it. If this first immune reaction is not sufficient to suppress the virus, the infection establishes itself in the body. This in turn triggers the next reaction involving interferon, which not only helps to fight the virus, but also means we become ill.  Alters our understanding of the immune system The discovery alters the way in which researchers and doctors previously understood the immune system. ""Our study fundamentally alters our understanding of how the body begins its defence against viruses. This can help to explain how we can be constantly exposed to the viruses and bacteria that always surround us, without activating the entire immune system every time, something that would lead to more frequent influenza-like symptoms,"" says S ren Riis Paludan, professor at the Department of Biomedicine at Aarhus University. He has headed the research project in Aarhus, while also collaborating with researchers from the University of Copenhagen as well as from universities in the USA and Germany. May explain serious diseases Experiments on mice have shown that mice, lacking this first defence mechanism, become ill if they are exposed to herpes virus, while normal mice remain healthy. ""We do not yet know the precise significance of this mechanism, but it may explain why some people become more ill from viral infections such as influenza than others. The same may apply to other viral infections that are initiated on mucous membranes such as HIV and herpes. We will now begin to map out the molecules that are involved. Once we have done this, it will be possible to identify people with defects in the mechanism, just as there is a potential to develop new forms of treatment. At the same time, the mechanism may turn out to have significance also for non-viral diseases, so continued research into this area shows great potential,"" says S ren Riis Paludan.

The refined technique addresses one of the major technical issues in the use of genome editing. The CRISPR-Cas9 system works by making a precisely targeted modification in a cell's DNA. The protein Cas9 alters the DNA at a location that is specified by a short RNA whose sequence matches that of the target site. While Cas9 is known to be highly efficient at cutting its target site, a major drawback of the system has been that, once inside a cell, it can bind to and cut additional sites that are not targeted. This has the potential to produce undesired edits that can alter gene expression or knock a gene out entirely, which might lead to the development of cancer or other problems. In a recently published paper Feng Zhang and his colleagues report that changing three of the approximately 1,400 amino acids that make up the Cas9 enzyme from S. pyogenes dramatically reduced  off-target editing  to undetectable levels in the specific cases examined. Zhang is the W.M. Keck Career Development Professor in Biomedical Engineering in MIT s departments of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Biological Engineering, and a member of both the Broad Institute and McGovern Institute. Zhang and his colleagues used knowledge about the structure of the Cas9 protein to decrease off-target cutting. DNA, which is negatively charged, binds to a groove in the Cas9 protein that is positively charged. Knowing the structure, the scientists were able to predict that replacing some of the positively charged amino acids with neutral ones would decrease the binding of  off target  sequences much more than  on target  sequences. After experimenting with various possible changes, Zhang s team found that mutations in three amino acids dramatically reduced  off-target  cuts. For the guide RNAs tested,  off-target  cutting was so low as to be undetectable. The newly-engineered enzyme, which the team calls  enhanced  S. pyogenes Cas9, or eSpCas9, will be useful for genome editing applications that require a high level of specificity. The Zhang Lab is immediately making the eSpCas9 enzyme available for researchers worldwide. The team believes the same charge-changing approach will work with other recently described RNA-guided DNA targeting enzymes, including Cpf1, C2C1, and C2C3, which Zhang and his collaborators reported on earlier this year. The prospect of rapid and efficient genome editing raises many ethical and societal concerns, says Zhang, who is speaking this morning at the International Summit on Gene Editing in Washington.  Many of the safety concerns are related to off-target effects,  he says.  We hope the development of eSpCas9 will help address some of those concerns, but we certainly don t see this as a magic bullet. The field is advancing at a rapid pace, and there is still a lot to learn before we can consider applying this technology for clinical use.","Published: December 3, 2015"

Upon infection, many viruses remain in the tissues and their DNA can be analysed even decades thereafter. Although their genetic material has been found in many organs, the researchers show that viral DNA is also present in bone. ""Human tissue is like a life-long archive that stores the fingerprint of the viruses that an individual has encountered during his or her lifetime,"" describes Klaus Hedman, professor of clinical virology. The finding has important implications since bone is most likely to be preserved after death, thus opening the door to the study of the viruses that caused infections in the past. In a publication the researchers show that this is indeed the case. They document the presence of parvovirus DNA in the bones of Finnish World War II casualties who remained exposed to diverse climatic conditions in former Finnish, current Russian territory, until recent years when they were repatriated to their homeland. The study involved bone samples from 106 deceased, and the viral DNA was discovered in nearly half of them. ""By mapping and analysing the viral genes in old human samples, we can deepen our understanding of the way viruses develop and spread. The results can be compared to those with contemporary viruses and their virulence, improving our ability to prevent and eradicate infectious diseases,"" the scientists explain. A unique DNA fingerprint The bones of two of the casualties contained DNA from a type of parvovirus that has never circulated in the Nordic countries. This information, together with the human DNA profiles of these individuals, suggested that they were likely soldiers of the Red Army.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/red-means-go-to-therapeutic-viruses-207050,Red Means  Go  to Therapeutic Viruses Rice University scientists use light to switch viral activity and deliver cargoes to cells  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Light is helping Rice University scientists control both the infectivity of viruses and gene delivery to the nuclei of target cells. The researchers have developed a method to use two shades of red to control the level and spatial distribution of gene expression in cells via an engineered virus. Although viruses have evolved to deliver genes into host cells, they still face difficulties getting their payloads from the cytoplasm into a cell s nucleus, where gene expression occurs. The Rice labs of bioengineers Junghae Suh and Jeffrey Tabor have successfully found a way to overcome this critical hurdle. The result from labs at Rice s BioScience Research Collaborative combines Suh s interest in designing viruses to deliver genes to target cells with Tabor s skills in optogenetics, in which light-responsive proteins can be used to control biological behavior.They built custom adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors by incorporating proteins that naturally come together when exposed to red light (650-nanometer wavelengths) and break apart when exposed to far red (750-nanometer wavelengths). These naturally light-responsive proteins help the viral capsids   the hard shells that contain genetic payloads  enter the host cell nuclei. AAV has been the vector of choice for gene editing by way of CRISPR/Cas9, a technique that shows promise for curing some genetic diseases, but cell nuclei present a problem, Suh said.  Viruses in general are relatively efficient at delivering genes into cells, but they still experience great limiting barriers,  she said.  If you add these viruses to cells, most of them seem to hang out outside of the nucleus, and only a small fraction make their way inside, which is the goal.  She said the team drew upon the Tabor lab s expertise in optogenetics to increase the AAVs  efficiency.  Jeff works with many different types of light-responsive proteins. The particular pair we decided upon was first identified in plants.  Light is really nice because you can apply it externally and you can control many aspects: at what areas the light is exposed, the duration of exposure, the intensity of the light and, of course, its wavelength,  she said. The protein pair comprises phytochrome B and its binding partner phytochrome interacting factor 6 (PIF6), both found in thale cress. The researchers generated host cells that express phytochrome B tagged with a nuclear localization sequence, a small peptide known to help shuttle proteins into the nucleus more effectively. The smaller PIF6 was then attached to the outside surface of the virus capsid.  When the viruses get internalized into a host cell, they accumulate around the nucleus naturally,  Suh said.  Under nonactivated conditions, most of the viruses are stuck there. But when we shine activating red light on the cells, these two plant proteins dimerize   they come together   and because of the nuclear localization tag on the phytochrome B, the virus is dragged into the nucleus.  This is the first time optogenetic proteins have been used to control the infectivity of viruses, she said, adding,  We didn t think it would work as well as it did.  Lead author Eric Gomez, a graduate student in Suh s lab, and co-author Karl Gerhardt, a graduate student in Tabor s lab, demonstrated the technique by activating patterns of AAV-infected cells in petri dishes by shining red light at them through masks. Suh said the platform may be used in the future to control what cells and tissues express a gene and at what level. The strategy could also find use in tissue-engineering applications like bioscaffolds for implantation.  Here, you might want to coax stem cells to develop into the right cells in some kind of spatially coordinated fashion,  she said. Use in the body is further off, because externally applied red light only goes so far through tissue to reach targets.  Ultimately, it s going to depend on the device you use to deliver the light,  she said.  But we imagine cases where you could use a catheter to go to the spot where you want the viruses to be much more infectious.  Suh said the Rice labs are working to make the next generation of capsids both more effective and more deliverable.  This is just the first step,  she said.  We have a lot of questions, like  Can we really do this in vivo?  kind of questions.  There have been a handful of papers trying to make the virus-infectious process responsive to light, but they were before the era of optogenetics,  Suh said.  They were using other types of synthetic molecules to make viruses light-responsive.  It seems using what Mother Nature has already provided in the form of light-responsive proteins works really well for us. ","Published: December 3, 2015"

Infection often leads to symptoms so severe that it was once called ""breakbone fever"" for the pain it causes, or even death. It's the fastest-growing and most prevalent mosquito-borne virus in the world, and although a third of the world's population is at risk of infection, there currently aren't any effective antiviral treatments or vaccines. A new study of the virus, led by Judith Frydman, a professor of biology and of genetics at Stanford, shows how disrupting a critical cellular pathway in the host can block the virus's life cycle at multiple steps. Drugs targeting this pathway could prevent virus infection in human and mosquito cells without eliciting drug resistance, the main problem in most antiviral therapies. This strategy could offer novel therapies against the dengue fever virus, also known as DENV, as well as other related human pathogens, such as West Nile virus, yellow fever and tick-borne encephalitis. Shutting down the chaperone Like all viruses, DENV relies heavily on the host to replicate. In particular, the infected host's cellular machinery is essential to produce and manage the viral proteome   the proteins that the virus expresses in order to survive and thrive in an infected host. By studying how the virus manipulates this machinery, the Frydman lab obtained insights into a new strategy to fight viral infection. Frydman's group focused on Hsp70, a type of protein found in most organisms and known as a ""chaperone."" Hsp70's main job is to help other proteins fold into their functional shape, and to then protect them from damage by environmental stresses. DENV, like many other viruses, also relies on Hsp70, to help replicate the viral genome, and ultimately produce the viral proteins it needs to take control of the host cells and spread infection. By defining how Hsp70 helps the virus replicate, the Frydman lab identified a strategy to block viral replication with very little toxicity to the host cell. In collaboration with labs at the University of California, San Francisco, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, they tested a series of drugs that target the host activities required by the virus, and showed that the virus is much more dependent on this chaperone than the host. This produces a very good therapeutic window against the virus with little toxicity. In the lab, Frydman's team found that inhibiting Hsp70 in human blood cells could block several strains of dengue, without harming the host cells. The result, Frydman said, provides a promising roadmap for addressing a virus for which there is currently no preventative treatment. Outmaneuvering the virus A constant challenge with developing preventive therapies for DENV and other viruses, however, is that they can rapidly produce a mutant strain that becomes resistant to the drug. Restricting Hsp70 proves to be an attractive antiviral approach for a number of reasons. First, because Hsp70 is involved in so many steps of the viral cycle, the virus could not produce mutant strains resistant to the drug, even after multiple attempts. ""This unusual lack of DENV drug-resistance to Hsp70-targeting compounds opens the way to both therapeutic and prophylactic use for short courses of treatment without losing effectiveness due to resistance, the major concern of most existing antivirals,"" Frydman said. ""We feel this important study targets a field of biology that is very poorly explored and will provide a new paradigm for a new way of thinking about antiviral drugs."" Second, because these compounds modulate Hsp70 rather than fully block its activity, they exhibit negligible toxicity to the relevant human target cells at concentrations that completely block virus production. Third, in the case of DENV, the antiviral dampened the release of small virally-induced proteins called cytokines, which can contribute to severe disease and create the ""cytokine storm"" associated with hemorrhagic fever forms of dengue. Perhaps most excitingly, Frydman said, the compounds are effective against different types of DENV and even different insect-borne flaviviruses, including West Nile virus, yellow fever and tick-borne encephalitis. The broad-spectrum action of this class of inhibitors suggests a strategy for pan-flavivirus antivirals with low potential for resistance. ""Our findings have major implications for our understanding of the interface between viral and chaperone biology, and provide a new way of thinking about strategies to develop a novel class of antivirals that will not be rendered ineffective by the emergence of drug-resistance,"" Frydman said. ""This unique property of targeting viral proteostasis therapeutically may close a fundamental gap in antiviral drug development.""","Published: December 3, 2015"

This opens up a wealth of future possibilities, such as using structures in the body to guide drug delivery, or cracks in rocks to direct environmental clean-up and exploration. These devices, which are a similar size to cells and bacteria -- around a hundredth of the average diameter of a strand of human hair -- could be used to deliver drugs to a specific location inside the body or outside of the body to diagnose diseases in blood samples. Examples include finding proteins indicating cardiac problems or looking for circulating tumour cells that can indicate the spread of cancer. When working with devices on a micron scale, it's very challenging to produce motion from moving parts due to the properties of the fluid -- it's similar to humans trying to run through treacle. Previous research has focused on using external magnetic fields to guide the devices, but this requires constant observation so that the device can be guided manually. The research conducted at Sheffield uses a new method, giving the devices a catalytic coating on one side, which creates a chemical reaction when fuel molecules are added, causing the device to move automatically on a pre-determined route, using natural structures as a guide. Dr Stephen Ebbens, Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Sheffield, said: ""When you're dealing with objects on such a small scale, we found that although our method of moving the devices using a coating and chemical reaction worked very effectively, it was difficult to control its direction, due to other molecules in the fluid jostling it. ""We've been working on ways to overcome this and control the movement of the devices along a path using physical structures to direct them. ""We are now working on applications for using these devices in the body, in the shorter term focusing on using them for medical diagnosis"" In addition to medical applications, these devices could be used in other fields, such as to locate indicators of contamination in environmental samples or to deliver neutralising chemicals to areas affected by oil spills, by using crevices in rocks as the structural guide.","Published: December 3, 2015"

Now a team at MIT has come up with an innovative approach that, unlike most traditional desalination systems, does not separate ions or water molecules with filters, which can become clogged, or boiling, which consumes great amounts of energy. Instead, the system uses an electrically driven shockwave within a stream of flowing water, which pushes salty water to one side of the flow and fresh water to the other, allowing easy separation of the two streams. The new approach is described in a paper by professor of chemical engineering and mathematics Martin Bazant, graduate student Sven Schlumpberger, undergraduate Nancy Lu, and former postdoc Matthew Suss. This approach is  a fundamentally new and different separation system,  Bazant says. And unlike most other approaches to desalination or water purification, he adds, this one performs a  membraneless separation  of ions and particles. Membranes in traditional desalination systems, such as those that use reverse osmosis or electrodialysis, are  selective barriers,  Bazant explains: They allow molecules of water to pass through, but block the larger sodium and chlorine atoms of salt. Compared to conventional electrodialysis,  This process looks similar, but it s fundamentally different,  he says. In the new process, called shock electrodialysis, water flows through a porous material  in this case, made of tiny glass particles, called a frit   with membranes or electrodes sandwiching the porous material on each side. When an electric current flows through the system, the salty water divides into regions where the salt concentration is either depleted or enriched. When that current is increased to a certain point, it generates a shockwave between these two zones, sharply dividing the streams and allowing the fresh and salty regions to be separated by a simple physical barrier at the center of the flow.  It generates a very strong gradient,  Bazant says. Even though the system can use membranes on each side of the porous material, Bazant explains, the water flows across those membranes, not through them. That means they are not as vulnerable to fouling   a buildup of filtered material   or to degradation due to water pressure, as happens with conventional membrane-based desalination, including conventional electrodialysis.  The salt doesn t have to push through something,  Bazant says. The charged salt particles, or ions,  just move to one side,  he says. The underlying phenomenon of generating a shockwave of salt concentration was discovered a few years ago by the group of Juan Santiago at Stanford University. But that finding, which involved experiments with a tiny microfluidic device and no flowing water, was not used to remove salt from the water, says Bazant, who is currently on sabbatical at Stanford. The new system, by contrast, is a continuous process, using water flowing through cheap porous media, that should be relatively easy to scale up for desalination or water purification.  The breakthrough here is the engineering [of a practical system],  Bazant says. One possible application would be in cleaning the vast amounts of wastewater generated by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. This contaminated water tends to be salty, sometimes with trace amounts of toxic ions, so finding a practical and inexpensive way of cleaning it would be highly desirable. This system not only removes salt, but also a wide variety of other contaminants   and because of the electrical current passing through, it may also sterilize the stream.  The electric fields are pretty high, so we may be able to kill the bacteria,  Schlumpberger says. The research produced both a laboratory demonstration of the process in action and a theoretical analysis that explains why the process works, Bazant says. The next step is to design a scaled-up system that could go through practical testing. Initially at least, this process would not be competitive with methods such as reverse osmosis for large-scale seawater desalination. But it could find other uses in the cleanup of contaminated water, Schlumpberger says. Unlike some other approaches to desalination, he adds, this one requires little infrastructure, so it might be useful for portable systems for use in remote locations, or for emergencies where water supplies are disrupted by storms or earthquakes. Maarten Biesheuvel, a principal scientist at the Netherlands Water Technology Institute who was not involved in this research, says the work  is of very high significance to the field of water desalination. It opens up a whole range of new possibilities for water desalination, both for seawater and brackish water resources, such as groundwater.  Biesheuvel adds that this team  shows a radically new design where within one and the same channel ions are separated between different regions.   I expect that this discovery will become a big  hit  in the academic field.   It will be interesting to see whether the upscaling of this technology, from a single cell to a stack of thousands of cells, can be achieved without undue problems. ","Published: December 3, 2015"

Dr J rgen Beck has been appointed as VP Clinical and Medical Affairs and Patrick Stragier as VP Operations. These appointments bring more than 45 combined years of experience in biopharmaceutical industry leadership to Promethera. They also bring a proven track record of success in cell therapy as well as wider areas of the medical affairs and clinical research, also including international, operational and managerial experience. One of the initial tasks for J rgen Beck will be to drive forward the clinical development of Promethera s lead product HepaStem in its current target of inborn errors of liver metabolism. He will also expand the focus of HepaStem to a wider target of acquired liver diseases and will contribute to the expansion of the Promethera product pipeline in large indications. Patrick Stragier will be responsible for developing the Promethera production and operations strategy. In the short term, he will be in charge of the production of HepaStem for ongoing clinical trials. In addition, he will be responsible for the strategy for scaling up production for later stage clinical trials, market needs and commercialization. Patrick will utilize his broad experience specifically in the cell therapy industry to contribute to the optimization of Promethera s production processes. These will need to meet Promethera s high industrial standards whilst maintaining affordable costs both for the patient and the community. ""Promethera has made these two key appointments to complete its management team. The appointments add a substantial skillset and expertise with both clinical development and operations/manufacturing,  said Dr John Tchelingerian, Chairman and CEO, Promethera.  Pushing forward the development of Promethera s lead product HepaStem in its current indication UCD, as well as expanding the targets and markets for our product portfolio is now a key task for the company. Both J rgen and Patrick have been specifically appointed by Promethera to use their expertise and international experience to achieve this.   I consider Promethera s product portfolio, especially its lead product HepaStem, has the potential to change the landscape of treatment in those adult liver diseases with a high unmet medical need and poor prognosis such as Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF),  said Dr J rgen Beck, VP Clinical and Medical Affairs.  As a result, I look forward to contributing to Promethera extending its clinical development beyond the diseases of inborn errors of liver metabolism. This could directly affect the improval of survival and improve the quality of life for patients with a range of conditions who currently have no or no satisfactory alternative treatment options.   This is a critical time for Promethera to develop manufacturing and industrialization processes. As the stem cell therapy industry is still developing, there are few manufacturing templates in existence for the sector. By uniquely targeting liver diseases, Promethera has to develop its own manufacturing rule book to enable long term continued supply of therapeutic cells at the highest quality standards in large amounts,  said Patrick Stragier, VP Operations.  It is an honour for me to be part of an innovative company whose mission is to improve the therapeutics efficacy and the quality of human life using advanced therapeutic medicinal products.  J rgen Beck has acquired more than 20 years of experience in medical affairs and clinical research in companies such as Boehringer Ingelheim, Synth labo, Epigenomics and InterMune. He also spent 5 years in clinical neurology and psychiatry. J rgen obtained a medical doctor degree from Heidelberg University and an MBA degree from Hagen University. Patrick Stragier is a biochemist with more than 25 years of international operational and managerial experience. He has worked for biopharmaceutical companies such as Solvay, DSM-Biologics, Genzyme and Lonza. Since 2009, Patrick has been working as a consultant specializing in cell therapy.

Dr Chalker says the new polymer is cheap to produce due to the global abundance of waste sulphur and limonene. That makes it affordable for use in large-scale environmental clean-ups, to coat water pipes carrying domestic and waste water, and even in removing mercury from large bodies of water. This has significant implications for human health and wellbeing as mercury exposure   whether through the skin or through ingestion, such as eating contaminated fish, is proven to damage the central nervous system and is particularly dangerous to pregnant women and children.  Mercury contamination plagues many areas of the world, affecting both food and water supplies and creating a serious need for an efficient and cost effective method to trap this mercury,  says Dr Chalker.  Until now, there has been no such method, but the new sulphur-limonene polysulfide addresses this urgent need.  More than 70 million tonnes of sulphur is produced each year by the petroleum industry, so there are literally mountains of it lying, unused, around the globe, while more than 70 thousand tons of limonene is produced each year by the citrus industry (limonene is found mainly in orange peels).  So not only is this new polymer good for solving the problem of mercury pollution, but it also has the added environmental bonus of putting this waste material to good use while converting them into a form that is much easier to store so that once the material is  full  it can easily be removed and replaced.  Another bonus that comes with Dr Chalker s polymer is that it has been found to remove toxic metals from water   and even in small amounts can be used as a mercury detector in areas where pollution is suspected because of the chemical reaction which causes it to turn yellow.","Published: December 3, 2015"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/the-manufacturing-challenges-of-nanotechnology-211606,The Manufacturing Challenges of Nanotechnology Head of NanoManufacturing at the Department of Engineering s Institute for Manufacturing  IfM  Dr Micha l de Volder explains why manufacturing carbon nanotubes is so difficult   and so important   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. We all know that graphene is the new wonder material   a sheet of carbon just one atom thick which is unbelievably strong, amazingly lightweight, virtually transparent and brilliant at conducting electricity and heat. It has the potential to revolutionise the way we store our energy, clean our drinking water and create a whole new generation of flexible electronic devices. Nanotechnology, in short, is the future. And all this will come from particles which are a hundred thousand times smaller than the width of a human hair. While much of the hype has tended to be around  two-dimensional  graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs)   rolled up sheets of graphene   have been quietly stealing a march. In fact, CNTs have been with us a lot longer than graphene. We know that hollow carbon nanofibres were observed as far back as the 1950s and researchers have been actively researching CNTs since the early 1990s. As a result, the manufacturing techniques for CNTs are comparatively mature, with several thousand tons being produced each year   unlike high quality graphene which is still very difficult to manufacture in large quantities. But this is by no means the end of the story. While this advance in production capacity is impressive, there are still major challenges to overcome before carbon nanotubes can really start to fulfil their potential. Most engineering applications need materials which are made up of multiple carbon nanotubes   and therein lies the difficulty. While an individual nanoparticle displays all those extraordinary properties, put one next to lots of others without carefully engineering the interactions between them and they start to lose their special powers. In fact, the mechanical and electrical figures of merit of a collection of nanoparticles drop off by at least an order of magnitude when compared to a single particle. We understand how to make carbon nanotubes and can do so in relatively large quantities. What we now need to learn is how to structure and organise them in such a way that they retain their properties when assembled into a device. And this, to a large extent, is a manufacturing challenge. At the moment, most carbon nanotube products are processed using traditional manufacturing techniques, such as injection moulding of CNT-polymer composites which do not give us any structural control over how the nanoparticles are arranged   and limit the material properties they can deliver. By developing new technologies which allow us to make devices containing well-organised nanoparticles we should be able to achieve a dramatic improvement in their performance and open up a whole raft of new application possibilities. Which is exactly what the IfM s NanoManufacturing Group is trying to do. The team was founded just two years ago and is itself a demonstration of rapid scale up, with five engineers, four chemists, two physicists and two material scientists already in post. The nanomanufacturing challenge is such a complex one that we need a multidisciplinary team to address it, as well as the collaboration of other universities, a broad spectrum of industries, and closer to home, collaborators in the Departments of Engineering, Materials Science, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and the Cavendish Laboratory. We also work very closely with other research centres at the IfM which are similarly engaged in developing new advanced materials and manufacturing processes. A good example of this collaborative approach is the EPSRC-funded project,  Advanced Nanotube Application and Manufacturing Initiative , which is bringing together engineers and materials scientists from the Universities of Cambridge and Ulster with a group of industrial partners to scale up a unique method for fabricating sheets and yarns of aligned carbon nanotubes. These will be used in next-generation lightweight composites, and can provide a much lighter alternative to copper wires in, for example, aerospace applications and high performance electric motors. The IfM s NanoManufacturing Group is also focusing on the development of technologies which can organise nanoparticles into hierarchical superstructures. To achieve this, we are researching how to simultaneously optimise material properties at three length scales: at the nanoscale on surface chemistry, at the microscale on form and structure and at the large scale to integrate the particles into devices. With funding from the European Research Council, the European Union s Marie Curie scheme and the EPSRC, the Group is exploring new ways of fabricating such carbon nanotube-based devices by, for instance, combining lithography with chemical engineering techniques. We have already made a significant breakthrough in the manufacturing of microstructured surfaces, which was published in a recent issue of Nature Communications. Microstructured surfaces can exhibit a variety of useful properties, including controllable mechanical stiffness and strength. They can even replicate the intricate structures found on the skins of certain plants and animals, making it possible to produce surfaces which have, say, the water-repellent or adhesive characteristics displayed by some insects. This particular technique works by causing carbon nanotubes to bend as they grow and form controllable complex shapes in three dimensions (see right). The process could also be used to engineer other properties, such as electrical and thermal conductivity and chemical reactivity, by attaching various coatings to the carbon nanotubes. In the meantime, our technique is already being put to good use, making surfaces which are being used as chemical microsensors, batteries and biomimetic smart surfaces. The promise of nanotechnology is such that billions of dollars of public money have been and continue to be spent on research by national governments. We are now reaching a tipping point where we understand the physical properties of many nanoparticles and how to produce them sufficiently well to start them on their journey to commercialisation. Indeed, it may come as a surprise to learn that CNTs are already being used commercially in a variety of products ranging from sporting goods and batteries to cars and bullet proof vests. This is only the beginning: we will soon see these small but mighty structures being put to many different uses.","Published: December 3, 2015"
6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/finding-even-the-tiniest-plastics-in-the-sea-194555,Finding Even the Tiniest Plastics in the Sea Two students havedeveloped a method that can measure the microplastics that other methods overlook  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Studies have estimated that each year between 4 and 12 million tonnes of plastics end up in the sea, and that the figure is expected to double over the next ten years. But we have only begun to learn what happens with the plastics afterwards. Using a filtration system mounted on the stern tube water intake of the marine research vessel Dana, the two students Robin Lenz and Kristina Enders collected microplastics on a route from northern Denmark across the Atlantic to the Sargasso Sea and back again. This enabled researchers from DTU Aqua to determine the volume of plastics in the sea.  This is the first time that the nearly invisible microplastics have been quantified so comprehensively. And we found microplastics everywhere along the almost 10,000 km long route,  says Professor Torkel Gissel Nielsen, DTU Aqua, co-author of two articles on the collection, which has just been published in Marine Pollution Bulletin:  There's a lot of focus on plastics in the sea just now, but there are still many unknowns. Therefore, there is a great need to develop new methods to examine the extent of the problem and understand what actually happens with the plastics that end up in the sea. For although plastics are everywhere, we do not find them in the quantities to be expected based on the the large quantities that every year is led out into sea, and the big question is what becomes of it?  asks the professor. Dana s expedition passed through very different marine areas from coastal zones across the open ocean to the famous vortices (gyres) in the Sargasso Sea. The highest concentrations of microplastics were found close to the coasts, i.e. in the English Channel and at the Azores as well as in the vortices in the Sargasso Sea, says research assistant Kristina Enders, DTU Aqua:  Despite sailing through the large areas with vortices, the so-called  gyres , we found that macro- as well as microplastics accumulate here, and large pieces of plastic were floating by every other minute, but it is wrong to refer to them as  plastic islands . On the other hand, we found microplastics in all samples from 13 to 501 pieces per cubic metre of water, i.e. up to 1 particle for every 2 litres of water. And there was a majority of the smallest plastic particles and fibres."" Microplastics overlooked While the traditional nets for examining volumes of plastics in the sea typically collects plastics larger than 300  m on the surface, the team from DTU has developed a method which can collect microplastics down to a depth of five metres while the ship is sailing. In this case, plastics down to 10-100  m, i.e. up to one and a half times the thickness of a human hair. ""We found microplastics everywhere along the almost 10,000 km long route."" Professor Torkel Gissel Nielsen, DTU Aqua  There are fundamental differences between how small and large microplastics are distributed in the sea. Our calculations show that the smaller the microplastics, the more they are distributed also down through the water, so that the larger pieces are on the surface and the smaller pieces are found at greater depths,"" explains Kristina Enders. Half of the microplastic particles and fibres were of the types that are lighter than water (polyethylene and polypropylene) and therefore remained on the surface for a longer period of time. In general, there is a need to develop appropriate methods, also when it comes to assessing what is, in fact, plastics in the samples collected. In this connection, the group tested the common method of counting the pieces of plastics under a microscope to subsequently verify, using Raman spectroscopy in collaboration with DTU Nanotech, whether it in reality was plastics that had been found. Research Assistant Robin Lenz, DTU Aqua:  Only slightly more than 60 per cent of the particles between 10 and 100  m that we tested in our samples turned out to be microplastics. Our experiments showed that visual determination only works for microplastics greater than 100  m. If it is smaller, it is too difficult to see the structure. Is it a piece of mineral, sand, organic material or plastics? When sufficiently small, everything looks the same.  Plastics estimates not adding up All in all, the research team did not find plastics in the magnitudes they would have expected in their examinations.  There is something in the plastics estimates that does not add up if what we learned in school about plastics taking twenty years to decompose is true. There is a lot to suggest that it depends on the conditions and that there are some processes in the sea that we are yet unable to explain, for example that plastics are broken down into microparticles that are mixed into the deep waters and is involved in various processes.  But are plastics in the sea even a problem?  The problem is that we know that there will be more, but we do not know what happens with it. We humans impact the sea. We find plastics everywhere in everything from copepods to fish but we do not know what they do and how they affect marine life and ecosystems. And once they has entered the sea as microplastics, there is nothing we can do to remove them again. So, if they in twenty years turns out to be a problem, we are stuck with them until nature removes them,  says Professor Torkel Gissel Nielsen.","Published: December 3, 2015"

Previous studies have demonstrated that these chemicals appear to be harming bees, birds and other wildlife. The new study is the first scientific evidence of a possible negative impact on widespread UK butterflies. The chemicals remain in the environment and can be absorbed by the wildflowers growing in field margins, many of which provide a nectar source for butterflies and food-plants for their caterpillars. Researchers at the Universities of Stirling and Sussex, in partnership with Butterfly Conservation and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, found population trends of 15 species - including Small Tortoiseshell, Small Skipper and Wall - showed declines associated with neonicotinoid use. The study is based on data gathered by volunteers from more than 1,000 sites across the UK as part of the long-running UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS). Dave Goulson, Professor of Biology at Sussex, said:  Many of us can remember a time when our meadows and hedgerows had far more butterflies, bees and other insects than today. This study adds to the growing mountain of evidence that neonicotinoids are one of the causes of these declines.  Ecologist Dr Andre Gilburn of the University of Stirling, who led the study, said:  Our study not only identifies a worrying link between the use of neonicotinoids and declines in butterflies, but also suggests that the strength of their impact on many species could be huge.  Dr Tom Brereton, Head of Monitoring at Butterfly Conservation, said:  We are extremely concerned with the findings of the study and are calling for urgent research to see whether the correlations we found are caused by neonicotinoid use, or some other aspect of intensive farming.  Widespread butterflies have declined by 58 percent on farmland in England over the last 10 years, giving concern for the general health of the countryside and for these and other insects in particular.

These bacteria cause a range of respiratory infections, including sinusitis, bronchitis, ear infections, pneumonia, meningitis and septicaemia. Respiratory infections are one of the biggest killers in the western world, and pneumococcal infections can range from mild to potentially deadly. Children and older people are most at risk, as well as those with compromised immune systems. Scientists from Diamond and the University of St Andrews have used crystallographic techniques on the synchrotron s MX beamlines to uncover the structure of NanC, a type of enzyme known as a  neuraminidase . These enzymes help the bacteria to grow and spread and are an important target for future antibiotics. S. pneumoniae bacteria contain up to three neuraminidase enzymes, Nan A, B and C. The scientists have already uncovered the structure of the other two neuraminidases   A and B   and the discovery of the NanC structure is the final step in identifying how these enzymes work to sustain S. pneumoniae and how they could be targeted and disabled, thus destroying the bacteria. Martin Walsh is deputy life sciences director at Diamond and lead author on the study. He comments:  With the structure of NanC, we now have a vital new piece of the puzzle which informs wider research into drug design and equips us to better tackle the pneumococcus in all its forms. The next step will be for scientists to use this structural information to aid in the design of inhibitors of the pneumococcus neuraminidases which could lead to new treatments for pneumococcal disease.  There are approximately 90 distinct pneumococcal serotypes and, although not all cause disease, this makes treatment challenging. An effective conjugate vaccine has been available since 2001. The vaccine targets 7 serotypes and has significantly reduced the invasive pneumococcal disease burden in the first world, especially for the vulnerable: the very young and old. This has recently been augmented by the introduction of a 13 serotype conjugate vaccine. However there has been a rise in antibiotic resistance in serotypes not covered by this conjugate vaccine and we are seeing previously non-infectious serotypes increasing in virulence. This makes treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia and less severe illnesses such as otitis media more difficult to manage. And so finding new approaches to combat pneumococcal disease remains a high priority. Because the pneumococcus rely on neuraminidases for survival, drugs that shut off these enzymes could aid new ways to treat infections. This approach is already used for influenza virus: both Tamiflu and Relenza target influenza neuraminidase which prevents the virus infection spreading but, as yet, no equivalent drugs exist for bacterial infections. The Diamond group s findings show that NanC does not function exactly like Nan A and B, so future antibiotics will have to work broadly enough to attack all three neuraminidases. Garry Taylor, Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Deputy Principal of the University of St Andrews, said:  With a fuller understanding of the structure and function of S. pnemoniae s three neuraminidase enzymes, we re now better equipped to design next-generation antibiotics for some of the world s most prevalent and deadly respiratory infections.
