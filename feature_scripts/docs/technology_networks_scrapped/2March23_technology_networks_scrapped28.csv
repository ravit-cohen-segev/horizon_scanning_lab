Dr Collin Becker is a mechanical engineer at the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Maryland, USA. His group studies materials for advanced lithium ion batteries and future-generation energy storage systems, such as sodium ion, magnesium ion and solid-state batteries. His research on lithium ion batteries focuses on developing high capacity anode materials to improve the overall energy density, rate of discharge and safety of electrochemical energy storage materials for electronics and vehicles. He also assists colleagues in the electrochemistry branch, characterizing materials such as novel cathode materials and solid-state electrolytes. Dr Becker investigates in situ changes in materials during battery charge and discharge with his Renishaw/Bruker combined Raman/AFM. This system unlike scanning electron microscopes (SEM) and x-ray photoelectron spectrometers (XPS) does not require samples to be in high vacuum. He can therefore use the Renishaw/Bruker system to study cells with standard electrolytes, in an inert environment provided by a glovebox. This provides the most realistic picture of the chemical and mechanical events taking place during battery cycling. He can also use the system to analyze other air and moisture sensitive samples. Speaking about the key advantage of using the Renishaw inVia system, Dr Becker said  The capability to use systems like the inVia in an argon-filled glovebox is critical for lithium ion battery materials since they are typically air and moisture sensitive. The ability to do mapping experiments and still be able to have the system coupled with the electrochemical cell used for in situ AFM is very important. ","Published: December 3, 2015"

It's such an appealing prospect that scientists who are announcing success with roundworms are keen to be clear they are a long way from achieving it in humans. ""We don't want people to get the impression they can take the drug we used in our study to extend their own teens or early twenties,"" says lead author Michael Petrascheck from The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), California. ""We may have done this in worms, but there are millions of years of evolution between worms and humans. ""We think it is exciting to see that extending lifespan by extending young adulthood can be done at all,"" he says. In the study to be published in the journal eLife, the TSRI-led team administered an antidepressant called mianserin to Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of roundworm used frequently in research. In 2007, they discovered that the drug increases the lifespan of roundworms by 30-40 per cent. Their new goal was to investigate how. The team treated thousands of worms with either water or mianserin and looked at the activity of genes as the worms aged. First, they measured the activity of genes in young adults as a reference point against which to monitor the aging process. Reproductive maturity begins in day-old roundworms and they live for 2-3 weeks on average. As the worms aged, the team observed dramatic changes in gene expression. However, the changes occurred in a way that came as a complete surprise. Groups of genes that together play a role in the same function were found to change expression in opposing directions. They have called this newly-discovered phenomenon 'transcriptional drift'. By examining data from mice and from 32 human brains aged 26 to 106 years, they confirmed that it also occurs in mammals. ""The orchestration of gene expression no longer seemed coordinated as the organism aged and the results were confusing because genes related to the same function were going up and down at the same time,"" says Petrascheck. ""Transcriptional drift can be used as a new metric for measuring age-associated changes that start in young adulthood,"" says first author Sunitha Rangaraju. ""Until now we have been dependent on measuring death rates, which are too low in young adults to provide much data. Having a new tool to study aging could help us make new discoveries, for example to treat genetic predispositions where aging starts earlier, such as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome,"" she says. Using this new metric revealed that treatment with mianserin can suppress transcriptional drift, but only when administered at the right time of life. By 10 days old, treated worms still had the gene expression characteristics of a three-day-old -- physiologically they were seven days younger. But by 12 days, the physiological changes required to extend lifespan were complete and lifelong exposure to the drug had no additional effect. Mortality rates were shifted parallel by 7-8 days across the treated worms' lifespan, confirming the finding. Mianserin blocked signals related to the regulation of serotonin and this delayed physiological changes associated with age, including the newly-identified transcriptional drift and degenerative processes that lead to death. The effect only occurred during young adulthood and the duration of this period of life was significantly extended. ""How much of our findings with regards to lifespan extension will spill over to mammals is anyone's guess, for example the extension of lifespan might not be as dramatic,"" says Petrascheck. ""However, we are already excited about the fact that we observed the phenomenon of transcriptional drift in species ranging from worms, mice to humans."" The findings have opened up many new avenues of research for the team and are likely to spawn a wealth of research by others. For example, a significant next step for the team will be to test the effect in mice and to investigate whether there are any side effects. Different environments could produce different results and this will need to be explored. They would also like to test whether the impact is different for different organs in the body. The discovery of 'transcriptional drift' raises the prospect of the phenomenon providing a new general metric for aging, but again this requires further research. In terms of extending teenage and young adult life in humans, just the idea invites a wealth of questions about the potential social implications and whether this would be as desirable as it first seems. eLifeRangaraju S et al.

Marrinucci will be honored at a gala in Washington, D.C. this evening. Marrinucci received the recognition for her efforts in developing a unique and novel approach to detect rare, circulating cancer cells through a non-invasive blood draw (also called a ""liquid biopsy""). The Epic Sciences no cell left behind  platform uses innovative imaging and software to reveal tumor cells spreading cancer through the bloodstream and analyzes each of the tumor cells identified for hallmarks of drug response and resistance. This enables real-time assessments of a patient's constantly evolving cancer and the personalization of medications from a simple blood draw. ""The platform we have developed at Epic Sciences addresses oncology's next frontier   the heterogeneity of cancer,"" says Marrinucci. ""The unfortunate reality is that tumors contain many distinct subpopulations of cells that each develop in their own way, which is why a drug may be effective against part of a tumor while the remainder continues to grow. This heterogeneity is why a single drug approach to treating cancer can be so ineffective   and why knowing the complete profile of the individual tumor cells driving disease can help identify a personalized cocktail of drugs that target as many cancer cells as possible. We are working on getting this kind of resolution starting with a simple blood draw using the Epic Sciences platform."" The Epic Sciences liquid biopsy platform stands apart from other liquid biopsy techniques because it detects circulating tumor cells (CTCs) without bias. Other approaches aim to isolate CTCs based on size or singular biomarkers, which will result in missing clinically important cell types. Epic Sciences' CTC technology has been integrated into over 60 clinical trials with more than 30 biotech and pharmaceutical companies to explore new biomarkers, understand the mechanism of action of targeted drugs and for the future development of companion diagnostic tests.

But the therapies used to keep the cancer in check have no effect on the primitive stem cells, also known as leukemia stem cells, that cause the disease in the first place - leaving patients susceptible to a relapse if they go off their meds. Now, using cells from a patient with CML, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have found the recipe to generate cells with properties of primitive human leukemia cells in the lab. The work establishes a potent model for studying CML stem cells and identifying new drugs that could potentially provide better treatment options for leukemia. ""Treatment doesn't eliminate the stem cells that cause chronic myeloid leukemia,"" explains Igor Slukvin, a UW-Madison professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and an expert on stem cells and human blood. ""We know we can treat CML, but we can't cure it. The stem cells persist."" Slukvin and his collaborators report their work online. By genetically reprogramming the patient's bone marrow cells, the Wisconsin group was able to turn back the developmental clock and make all-purpose induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which capture the underlying genetic alterations driving the leukemia. Directing the induced primitive CML cells to become early blood cells, researchers were able to generate cells that share many properties of leukemia stem cells, including increased long-term survival and proliferation as well as innate resistance to drugs. The drugs now used to treat CML are known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors; they work by stopping the progression and proliferation of the cancer cells emanating from the bone marrow. Though these drugs are very effective, patients risk relapse if they stop taking the medication. Moreover, in some patients the leukemia cells develop resistance to the drug, making it less effective. The ability to make leukemia stem cells in the lab using reprogrammed adult bone marrow cells from patients will give scientists a new way to explore the development and progression of the disease in a laboratory dish. Currently, only mouse models of leukemia stem cells are available in the lab. The advent of a human cell model opens the door to exploring the differences in how the disease manifests itself within different people. ""The induced cells capture the genetic abnormality of the individual patient,"" says Slukvin, creating the potential for more personalized treatment of the disease.  In addition, the new cell model creates a path to capture the genetic variations of the disease as it manifests itself in individual patients. Because iPSCs arise from a single cell, the selection of individual cloned iPSC cells makes it possible to capture the diversity of genetic alterations within individual stem cells and study their effects. Because the disease transitions through chronic, accelerated and acute phases in patients, the new model may also let scientists study the progression of leukemia in the lab.  ""If we make iPSCs from stored patient samples collected at different stages of diseases,"" notes Slukvin, ""we can produce from these iPSCs primitive leukemia cells that capture different stages of leukemia progression.""   An important potential application is that the lab-created human stem cells, like other types of synthesized stem cells or their derivatives, can also be used to learn more about leukemia stem cell survival factors and develop high-throughput drug screens where chemical compounds can be tested for efficacy and safety as potential drug candidates. Slukvin and his team, in fact, used the new system to discover a novel primitive leukemia cell survival factor, a protein known as olfactomedin 4.  Using drugs or antibodies to target the protein, which helps the primitive CML cells survive, may open an avenue to clear the leukemia and potentially cure the disease, although much work remains to be done to achieve such an outcome.

We used considerable computer power to provide a unified conceptual picture of the motions in proteins over a huge range of timescales, from the very shortest lengths of time at which atoms move (picoseconds) right up to the lifetimes of proteins in cells (roughly 1000 seconds). It changes what we think a protein fundamentally is.  Studying proteins their structure and function is essential to advancing understanding of biological systems relevant to different energy and medical sciences, from bioenergy research and subsurface biogeochemistry to drug design. Results obtained by Smith s UT graduate student, Xiaohu Hu, revealed that the dynamics of single protein molecules are  self-similar  and out of equilibrium over an enormous range of timescales.With the help of Titan  the fastest supercomputer in the U.S., located at the DOE Office of Science s Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility Smith s team developed a complete picture of protein dynamics, revealing that the structural fluctuations within any two identical protein molecules, even if coded from the same gene, turn out to be different.  A gene is a code for a protein, producing different copies of the protein that should be the same, but the internal fluctuations of these individual protein molecules may never reach equilibrium, or converge,  Smith said.  This is because the fluctuations themselves are continually aging and don t have enough time to settle down before the protein molecules are eaten up in the cell and replaced.  Understanding the out-of-equilibrium phenomenon has biological implications because the function of a protein depends on its motions. Two individual protein molecules, even though they come from the same gene, will not function precisely the same way within the cell.  You may have, for example, two identical enzyme molecules that catalyze the same reaction,  said Smith.  But due to the absence of equilibrium, the rate at which the catalysis happens will be slightly different for the two proteins. This affects the biological function of the protein.  The team also discovered that the dynamics of single protein molecules are self-similar, or fractal over the whole range of timescales. In other words, the motions in a single protein molecule look the same however long you look at them for, from picoseconds to hundreds of seconds.  The motions in a protein, how the bits of the protein wiggle and jiggle relative to each other, resemble one another on all these timescales,  Smith said.  We represent the shape of a protein as a point. If it changes its shape due to motions, it goes to a different point, and so on. We joined these points, drawing pictures, and we found that these pictures are the same when you look at them on whatever timescale, whether it s nanoseconds, microseconds, or milliseconds.  By building a more complete picture of protein dynamics, the team s research reveals that motions of a single protein molecule on very fast timescales resemble those that govern the protein s function. To complete all of the simulations, the team combined the power of Titan with two other supercomputers Anton, a specialty parallel computer built by D.E. Shaw Research, and Hopper, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center s Cray XE6 supercomputer located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  Titan was especially useful for us to get accurate statistics,  Smith said.  It allowed us to do a lot of simulations in order to reduce the errors and get more confident results.

Driven by the quest for eternal youth, humankind has spent centuries obsessed with the question of how it is exactly that we age. With advancements in molecular genetic methods in recent decades, the search for the genes involved in the ageing process has greatly accelerated. Until now, this was mostly limited to genes of individual model organisms such as the C. elegans nematode, which revealed that around one percent of its genes could influence life expectancy. However, researchers have long assumed that such genes arose in the course of evolution and in all living beings whose cells have a preserved a nucleus   from yeast to humans. Combing through 40,000 genes Researchers at ETH Zurich and the JenAge consortium from Jena have now systematically gone through the genomes of three different organisms in search of the genes associated with the ageing process that are present in all three species   and thus derived from the genes of a common ancestor. Although they are found in different organisms, these so-called orthologous genes are closely related to each other, and they are all found in humans, too. In order to detect these genes, the researchers examined around 40,000 genes in the nematode C. elegans, zebra fish and mice. By screening them, the scientists wanted to determine which genes are regulated in an identical manner in all three organisms in each comparable ageing stage   young, mature and old; i.e. either are they upregulated or downregulated during ageing. As a measure of gene activity, the researchers measured the amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules found in the cells of these animals. mRNA is the transcript of a gene and the blueprint of a protein. When there are many copies of an mRNA of a specific gene, it is very active; the gene is upregulated. Fewer mRNA copies, to the contrary, are regarded as a sign of low activity, explains Professor Michael Ristow, coordinating author of the recently published study and Professor of Energy Metabolism at ETH Zurich. Out of this volume of information, the researchers used statistical models to establish an intersection of genes that were regulated in the same manner in the worms, fish and mice. This showed that the three organisms have only 30 genes in common that significantly influence the ageing process. Reduce gene activity, live longer By conducting experiments in which the mRNA of the corresponding genes were selectively blocked, the researchers pinpointed their effect on the ageing process in nematodes. With a dozen of these genes, blocking them extended the lifespan by at least five percent. One of these genes proved to be particularly influential: the bcat-1 gene. ""When we blocked the effect of this gene, it significantly extended the mean lifespan of the nematode by up to 25 percent,"" says Ristow. The researchers were also able to explain how this gene works: the bcat-1 gene carries the code for the enzyme of the same name, which degrades so-called branched-chain amino acids. Naturally occurring in food protein building blocks, these include the amino acids L-leucine, L-isoleucine and L-valine. When the researchers inhibited the gene activity of bcat-1, the branched-chain amino acids accumulated in the tissue, triggering a molecular signalling cascade that increased longevity in the nematodes. Moreover, the timespan during which the worms remained healthy was extended. As a measure of vitality, the researchers measured the accumulation of ageing pigments, the speed at which the creatures moved, and how often the nematodes successfully reproduced. All of these parameters improved when the scientists inhibited the activity of the bcat-1 gene. The scientists also achieved a life-extending effect when they mixed the three branched-chain amino acids into the nematodes' food. However, the effect was generally less pronounced because the bcat-1 gene was still active, which meant that the amino acids continued to be degraded and their life-extending effects could not develop as effectively. Conserved mechanism Ristow has no doubt that the same mechanism occurs in humans. ""We looked only for the genes that are conserved in evolution and therefore exist in all organisms, including humans,"" he says. In the present study, he and his Jena colleagues from the Leibniz Institute on Aging, the Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology, the Jena University Hospital and the Friedrich Schiller University purposefully opted not to study the impact on humans. But a follow-up study is already being planned. ""However we cannot measure the life expectancy of humans for obvious reasons,"" says the ETH professor. Instead, the researchers plan to incorporate various health parameters such as cholesterol or blood sugar levels in their study to obtain indicators on the health status of their subjects. Health costs could be massively reduced Ristow says that the multiple branched-chain amino acids are already being used to treat liver damage and are also added to sport nutrition products. ""However, the point is not for people to grow even older, but rather to stay healthy for longer,"" says the internist. The study will deliver important indicators on how the ageing process could be influenced and how age-related diseases such as diabetes or high blood pressure could be prevented. In light of unfavourable demographics and steadily increasing life expectancy, it is important to extend the healthy life phase and not to reach an even higher age that is characterised by chronic diseases, argue the researchers. With such preventive measures, an elderly person could greatly improve their quality of life while at the same time cutting their healthcare costs by more than half.","Published: December 2, 2015"

The liver is the largest internal organ in the human body, serving as the main site of metabolism. Human hepatocytes   cells that comprise 85% of the liver   are routinely used by the pharmaceutical industry for study of hepatotoxicity, drug clearance and drug-drug interactions. They also have clinical applications in cell therapy to correct genetic defects, reverse cirrhosis, or support patients with a liver-assist device. Regrettably, while the human liver can rapidly regenerate in vivo, recognized by the ancient Greeks in the myth of Prometheus, this capability to proliferate is rapidly lost when human cells are removed from the body. Thus far, attempts to expand human hepatocytes in the laboratory resulted in immortalized cancer cells with little metabolic function. The scarce supply of human hepatocytes and this inability to expand them without losing function is a major bottleneck for scientific, clinical and pharmaceutical development.

Death and dysfunction of these cells cause vision loss in conditions like glaucoma and multiple sclerosis.  Our work could lead not only to a better understanding of the biology of the optic nerve, but also to a cell-based human model that could be used to discover drugs that stop or treat blinding conditions,  says study leader Donald Zack, M.D., Ph.D., the Guerrieri Family Professor of Ophthalmology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  And, eventually it could lead to the development of cell transplant therapies that restore vision in patients with glaucoma and MS.  The laboratory process entails genetically modifying a line of human embryonic stem cells to become fluorescent upon their differentiation to retinal ganglion cells, and then using that cell line for development of new differentiation methods and characterization of the resulting cells. Using a genome editing laboratory tool called CRISPR-Cas9, investigators inserted a fluorescent protein gene into the stem cells  DNA. This red fluorescent protein would be expressed only if another gene was also expressed, a gene named BRN3B (POU4F2). BRN3B is expressed by mature retinal ganglion cells, so once a cell differentiated into a retinal ganglion cell, it would appear red under a microscope. Next, they used a technique called fluorescence-activated cell sorting to separate out the newly differentiated retinal ganglion cells from a mixture of different cells into a highly purified cell population for study. The cells showed biological and physical properties seen in retinal ganglion cells produced naturally, says Zack. Researchers also found that adding a naturally occurring plant chemical called forskolin on the first day of the process helped improve the cells  efficiency of becoming retinal ganglion cells. The researchers caution that forskolin, which is also widely available as a weight loss and muscle building supplement and is touted as an herbal treatment for a variety of disorders, is not scientifically proven safe or effective for treatment or prevention of blindness or any other disorder.  By the 30th day of culture, there were obvious clumps of fluorescent cells visible under the microscope,  says lead author Valentin Sluch, Ph.D., a former Johns Hopkins biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology student and now a postdoctoral scholar working at Novartis, a pharmaceutical company. Sluch completed this research at Johns Hopkins before transitioning to Novartis.  I was very excited when it first worked,  Sluch says.  I just jumped up from the microscope and ran [to get a colleague]. It seems we can now isolate the cells and study them in a pure culture, which is something that wasn t possible before.   We really see this as just the beginning,  adds Zack. In follow-up studies using CRISPR, his lab is looking to find other genes that are important for ganglion cell survival and function.  We hope that these cells can eventually lead to new treatments for glaucoma and other forms of optic nerve disease.  To use these cells to develop new treatments for MS, Zack is working with Peter Calabresi, M.D., professor of neurology and director of the Johns Hopkins Multiple Sclerosis Center.","Published: December 2, 2015"

The gene codes for a protein that was first identified when a mutated form was shown to cause narcolepsy. Caring for patients with heart failure costs the United States $40 billion a year, according to Euan Ashley, MRCP, DPhil, associate professor of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford. Despite the condition s enormous impact, few new treatments have been developed, and those that exist produce varied responses among patients. One major challenge to the development of new treatments has been the lack of genes that can be confidently associated with heart failure. Ashley is hopeful that the new finding will open doors to evaluating possible treatments. Ashley is the senior author. The lead author is Marco Perez, MD, assistant professor of cardiovascular medicine, who said the study was motivated by the observation that individual patients with heart failure often respond differently to the same types of medical interventions.  We have noticed some patients with heart failure who get medical therapy respond really nicely,  Perez said.  Their heart function improves dramatically with medications. Whereas other patients, despite medical therapy, continue to worsen and require transplant.  Perez wondered if there were genetic reasons for the discrepancies in treatment outcomes observed in the study. He suspected genetic variation in the study s patient group might point toward a link. From men to mice The team genotyped heart-failure patients at the extremes of responses   those who had the best and worst responses to therapy. They combined these results with gene expression data from human cardiac tissue available from a large, publicly accessible data set. By combining a variety of approaches including network modeling, which looks at the relationship between genes, the team searched for genetic variants associated with heart health. Intrigued that their analyses spotlighted a gene near the region coding for the orexin receptor protein, which is known to be involved in the control of sleep, appetite and blood pressure, the team investigated further. Through a series of experiments, the researchers concluded that the gene likely regulates how much of the receptor is made in a cell. They then looked for evidence that the orexin receptor could be involved in heart function and found that its expression was increased in diseased human heart tissue. The researchers wondered whether this could mean that the receptor and its binding partner, orexin, have a protective function in the heart.  We found this new receptor that looked very promising,  said Ashley.  But what I m most proud of is that the team didn t stop there; they went on to validate it in another data set, explore its mechanism in cellular models and then test the effect in several different mouse models.  Using a mouse model that mimics heart failure through artificially elevated levels of adrenaline, the researchers examined the role of the receptor and orexin. They found that if they gave orexin to the mice with failing hearts, those mice showed better systolic heart function   relating to the contraction phase of a heartbeat   than did mice that did not receive orexin. Ultrasounds of the hearts in a different group of mice, which were missing the orexin receptor, showed that these mice had greater diastolic heart dysfunction   relating to the relaxation phase of a heartbeat   another hint suggesting that the receptor is important for healthy hearts.  The exciting thing is that this gene is in a completely different neurohormonal axis   a completely different pathway than what has been looked at previously,  Perez said.  Nobody had ever studied heart function in relation to this gene.  The project was selected to receive funding from Stanford s SPARK program, a drug and diagnostic development program that supports promising research with the potential to move from the laboratory to the bedside. Perez, whose work won him recognition as a finalist for the 2013 American Heart Association Young Investigator s Award, said he is optimistic that exploring the role of this receptor in the heart could inform new research, possibly leading to the development of novel therapies. Sleep and hearts The orexin receptor s link to narcolepsy was identified in 2000 by a research group that includedEmmanuel Mignot, MD, PhD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, but the new study marks the first time the gene and receptor have been associated with heart failure. Perez, Ashley and their team are eager to do further studies to explore this link.  The connection between sleep and the heart is fascinating,  said Ashley, who has recently been spending more time interacting with his sleep-expert colleagues in an effort to explore possible associations. In fact, the finding has raised the question of whether insomnia medications that work by blocking the function of the orexin receptor could harm the heart, although this has not yet been studied, Perez said.  We already know that sleep apnea is bad for the heart,  said Ashley.  One of the things we are now hoping to do is look at heart function in patients with narcolepsy. ","Published: December 2, 2015"

In fact, researchers found that in cell and mouse models, a treatment that employed a targeted monoclonal antibody effectively impaired the ability of CSCs to regenerate and made them easier to eradicate with existing enzyme-targeted (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) therapies.  This is the first description of cancer stem cell generation through decreased expression of a transcriptional repressor of an embryonic pattern of alternative splicing that enhances stem cell self-renewal and survival,  said senior author Catriona Jamieson, MD, PhD, associate professor of medicine, chief of the Division of Regenerative Medicine and director of Stem Cell Research at Moores Cancer Center. Rather than acquiring multiple DNA mutations, as was previously thought, cancer stem cells in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) switch to embryonic RNA splicing, which enhances their capacity to self-renew or clone themselves,  said Jamieson.  If we can detect and turn off embryonic splicing, we may be able to prevent cancer stem cells from propagating themselves.  Also, if we target embryonic versions of proteins that are re-expressed by cancer, like CD44 variant 3, with specific antibodies together with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, we may be able to circumvent cancer relapse   a leading cause of cancer-related mortality.  Jamieson and colleagues showed that downregulation of Muscleblind-like 3 (MBNL3) RNA binding proteins resulted in re-expression of a human embryonic stem cell-specific alternative splicing gene regulatory network   a mechanism that controls embryonic stem cell pluripotency and fate. One effect was reprogramming of progenitor cells into CSCs in blast crisis CML. Blast crisis occurs when there is 20 percent or more leukemia stem cells in the blood or bone marrow. It is the most advanced stage of leukemia. The researchers found, however, that treatment with a humanized pan-CD44 monoclonal antibody and a targeted tyrosine kinase antagonist disrupted development of CSCs in their protected microenvironment, forcing them to enter the blood stream where dasatinib   a tyrosine kinase inhibitor   could effectively target them.","Published: December 2, 2015"

The overarching mission of the MATURA Consortium is to improve patient care in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) by rationalizing therapy decisions through a stratified medicine approach. MATURA (MAximizing Therapeutic Utility for Rheumatoid Arthritis) aims to identify treatment response predictors which will allow the allocation of patients to subgroups defined by the therapy they are most likely to respond to, early in the disease process. RA provides the ideal setting for the introduction of a stratified medicine approach as the treatment is standardized, there is a significant non-responder rate to each marketed and commonly used drug, and early and effective therapy has consistently been shown to improve long-term outcomes, including joint damage, disability and employment. Professor Costantino Pitzalis from Queen Mary University of London, who leads the Consortium, said:  We are delighted that Protagen has joined our Consortium. There are currently a number of biologic treatments in RA and at the moment, we have no way of predicting favorable patient drug response before therapy selection and treatment . Professor Anne Barton from the University of Manchester, who co-leads the consortium, explained:  Being able to accurately predict whether a treatment will work or not, would lead to more targeted and individual treatments as well as greater efficacy and better quality of life for patients. Protagen and its unique, proprietary SeroTag  platform is a new key asset to our group of established industry partners, and significantly support our quest for Treatment Response Predictors . Stefan M llner, Protagen CEO, adds,  Our innovative SeroTag  technology allows for the first time the systematic determination of response prediction markers to select the most appropriate drug and therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis. In addition, it enables new approaches for successful drug development, and to support patients, rheumatologists, payers and the pharma industry in our combined effort to improve patient management by rationalizing treatment decision. This is exactly what MATURA is aiming for and we feel privileged to be part of the Consortium and support these efforts. ","Published: December 2, 2015"

The retrospective study reviewed records of 16 patients who underwent bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in which a femoral nerve block was administered at the first operation and a periarticular injection of extended-release bupivacaine liposome mixture was used after the second operation. The same surgeon performed both TKAs in all patients studied. An average of 2.3 years separated the two procedures. The study found patients recovered quicker when they received periarticular injections of analgesic medication, according to the orthopedic surgeon, Brandon Horn, DO, of the McLaren Greater Lansing Medical Center in Michigan. Postoperative pain control is essential to recovery from total knee arthroplasty because patients must bear weight on the new joint within 12 to 24 hours after surgery and begin physical therapy, the researchers noted. ""Periarticular injections, unlike femoral nerve blocks, allow patients to maintain control of the quadriceps muscles. The tenants of osteopathic medicine tell us that function follows form, so enabling the quadriceps to fully engage helps patients to get up and begin walking independently faster,"" Dr. Horn explained. ""There's also a preventative component at work, since femoral nerve blocks are also associated with a high incidence of postoperative falls."" Patients receiving a periarticular injection averaged 2.3 inpatient physical therapy sessions, compared to 3.5 inpatient physical therapy sessions for those receiving the femoral nerve block. The investigators also reported a half-day decrease in hospital stay. Those factors resulted in notable cost savings. ""To treat knee replacement patients with a nerve block, you're looking at about $400 in additional costs for the procedure alone compared to that of the analgesic injection,"" said Dr. Horn.

The researchers were able to tweak social hierarchy in animals by using vitamin B3. -There are important differences in how individuals approach life. While some people are relaxed and calm, others often see situations as threatening, making them worried and tense. This kind of  trait  anxiety has significant consequences on a person s social life, undermining their confidence to compete for social standing. In our competitive world, high-anxious individuals have a disadvantage and can feel overlooked and rejected; as a result this can lead to what psychologists call  social subordination . Publishing in PNAS, neuroscientists at cole polytechnique f d rale de Lausanne (EPFL) have pinpointed an area of the brain related to motivation and depression that could link trait anxiety to social subordination. Both animals and humans establish social ranks through competition, which in turn determines the hierarchy of a social group. The ability to compete depends on different features including size, age, and previous social experience. Some research shows that social competition is also influenced by personality traits, but this has not been explored in depth. There is a growing suspicion among social scientists and psychologists that when individuals present high anxiety as a personality characteristic, it might actually predispose a person to perform poorly in social competition, trapping them in a vicious cycle of trait anxiety and low social status. However, we know very little about the neuroscience behind this cycle, which could be the key to breaking it. The lab of Carmen Sandi at EPFL now brings biological evidence to bear upon the field. The researchers performed a series of experiments to identify the brain areas involved in trait anxiety and social competition. The experiments involved categorizing rats on a spectrum of trait anxiety, from low-anxious to high-anxious rats, which model trait anxiety. The animals underwent several behavioral tests that required high-anxious rats to compete socially with their low-anxious counterparts, and their performance was quantified and analyzed statistically. In addition, the researchers examined the brains of the rats to identify changes in biological function. The experiments highlighted an area of the brain known as the  nucleus accumbens , which has been long-associated with motivation, reward and depression in humans too. When competing socially, most of the high-anxious rats took on a lower social status technically described as becoming  socially subordinate . The nucleus accumbens of these particular rats showed a reduced energy metabolism. This involves the mitochondria, which are the cell s organelles that are in charge of breathing and energy production. The researchers found that the high-anxious rats showed lower mitochondrial function than more relaxed ones. The scientists confirmed their findings with pharmacological manipulation: they gave the nucleus accumbens of rats drugs that either block or enhance mitochondria one of the drugs was a part of the common vitamin B3 (niacin). When rats received blocking agents, their social competitiveness dropped, taking their social status with it. On the other hand, when high-anxious rats were given enhancers, rats performed significantly better socially, thereby achieving higher social status. But the effects were not permanent: when the drugs wore off, the rats generally returned to their original rung of the social ladder. The study confirms that trait anxiety can actually predispose an individual to a lower social status. This could mean that pharmacological manipulation of mitochondria in the nucleus accumbens could potentially influence the social rank of a person. The study is also the first to relate that brain energy metabolism influences the establishment of social hierarchies. Carmen Sandi remains cautious, since the study involved rats rather than humans; after all, brain function is just one of the many elements that influence social dynamics.  Social interactions are immensely complex,  says Sandi.  They involve so many factors that it is difficult to examine the impact of each in isolation. However, this is an exciting finding that shows a brain mechanism whereby anxious personality affects social competitiveness - and this points to very promising directions in this field.

The findings are published online in the journal Headache, a publication of the American Headache Society. ""If you have asthma along with episodic or occasional migraine, then your headaches are more likely to evolve into a more disabling form known as chronic migraine,"" explains Vincent Martin, MD, professor of medicine in UC's Division of General Internal Medicine, co-director of the Headache and Facial Pain Program at the UC Neuroscience Institute and lead author in the study. Martin teamed with Richard Lipton, MD, and Dawn Buse, PhD, both of Montefiore Headache Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and Kristina Fanning, PhD, Daniel Serrano, PhD, and Michael Reed, PhD, all from Vedanta Research, to study about 4,500 individuals who experienced episodic migraine or fewer than 15 headaches per month in 2008. ""Migraine and asthma are disorders that involve inflammation and activation of smooth muscle either in blood vessels or in the airways,"" says Lipton, director of Montefiore Headache Center, vice chair of neurology and the Edwin S Lowe Chair in Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and founder of the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study. ""Therefore, asthma-related inflammation may lead to migraine progression."" About 12 percent of the U.S. population experiences migraine, which is almost three times more common in women than in men, according to Martin. Individuals with chronic migraine have headaches 15 or more days per month; this affects about 1 percent of the U.S. population and takes a severe toll on sufferers who often miss work and social events. Asthma affects about 8 percent of American adults, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The researchers analyzed data from the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP) Study. Study participants completed written questionnaires both in 2008 and 2009. Based on responses to the 2008 questionnaire, they were divided into two groups one with episodic migraine and coexisting asthma and another with episodic migraine and no asthma. They were also asked about medication usage, depression and smoking status. The 2008 and 2009 questionnaires included questions about their frequency of headache, which enabled the authors to identify the participants who had progressed to chronic migraine. Researchers found that after one year of follow-up, new onset chronic migraine developed in 5.4 percent of participants also suffering from asthma and in 2.5 percent of individuals without asthma. ""In this study, persons with episodic migraine and asthma at baseline were more than twice as likely to develop chronic migraine after one year of follow-up as compared to those with episodic migraine but not asthma,"" says Martin. ""The strength of the relationship is robust; asthma was a stronger predictor of chronic migraine than depression, which other studies have found to be one of the most potent conditions associated with the future development of chronic migraine,"" explains Martin. Researchers have considered various theories as to why asthma may have a predictive role in chronic migraine development for individuals with episodic or occasional migraine. Asthmatic patients are more likely to also have allergies and the researchers have shown in prior studies than patients with allergies might be prone to more frequent headaches particularly if they have hay fever, explains Martin. Another possibility is that patients with asthma may have an overactive parasympathetic nervous system that predisposes them to attacks of both migraine and asthma, says Martin. It's also possible that asthma may not directly cause chronic migraine, but that a shared environmental or genetic factor, like air pollution, which has been known to trigger both asthma and migraine attacks may play a role, he explains. So what does someone suffering from occasional migraine do to avoid chronic migraine? Martin says physicians may want to prescribe preventive medications for migraine at an earlier stage in these patients. ""Also, if allergies are the trigger it begs the question should we treat allergies more aggressively in these patients?"" says Martin. University of Cincinnati  press release Martin VT et al.

Moreover, that ""forgotten"" first language may well influence what goes on in your brain when you speak English or French today. In a paper published in Nature Communications, researchers from McGill University and the Montreal Neurological Institute describe their discovery that even brief, early exposure to a language influences how the brain processes sounds from a second language later in life. Even when the first language learned is no longer spoken. It is an important finding because this research tells scientists both about how the brain becomes wired for language, but also about how that hardwiring can change and adapt over time in response to new language environments. The research has implications for our understanding of how brain plasticity functions, and may also be important information about creating educational practices geared to different types of learners. The researchers asked three groups of children (aged 10 - 17) with very different linguistic backgrounds to perform a task that involved identifying French pseudo-words (such as vapagne and chansette). One group was born and raised in unilingual French-speaking families. The second group were adopted from China into a French-speaking family before age three, stopped speaking Chinese, and from that point on heard and used only French. The third group were fluently bilingual in Chinese and French. As the children responded to the words they heard, the researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at which parts of their brains were being activated. Although all groups performed the tasks equally well, the areas of the brain that were activated differed between the groups. In monolingual French children with no exposure to Chinese, areas of the brain, notably the left inferior frontal gyrus and anterior insula, expected to be involved in processing of language-associated sounds were activated. However, among both the children who were bilingual (Chinese/French) and those who had been exposed to Chinese as young infants and had then stopped speaking it, additional areas of the brain, particularly the right middle frontal gyrus, left medial frontal cortex, and bilateral superior temporal gyrus were activated. The researchers found that the Chinese children who had been adopted into unilingual French families and no longer spoke Chinese, and so were functionally unilingual at the time of testing, still had brains that processed language in a way that is similar to bilingual children. ""During the first year of life, as a first step in language development, infants' brains are highly tuned to collect and store information about the sounds that are relevant and important to the language they hear around them,"" said Lara Pierce, a doctoral student at McGill and the first author on the article. ""What we discovered when we tested the children who had been adopted into French-language families and no longer spoke Chinese, was that, like children who were bilingual, the areas of the brain known to be involved in working memory and general attention were activated when they were asked to perform tests involving language.

The results suggest a role for MRI in determining when to allow concussed athletes to return to competition. Concussions affect millions of people each year and are especially prevalent in contact sports like football. Sports are second only to motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of traumatic brain injury among people between 15 and 24 years old, according to the National Institutes of Health (USA). Decisions to clear concussed athletes to return to action are typically based on symptoms and cognitive and neurological test results. However, there is increasing evidence that brain abnormalities persist beyond the point of clinical recovery after injury. To find out more, researchers from the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee studied concussed football players with arterial spin labeling, an advanced MRI method that detects blood flow in the brain. ""This measurement of blood flow is fully noninvasive, without radiation exposure,"" said study author Yang Wang, MD, PhD, associate professor of radiology at the Medical College of Wisconsin. ""We use arterial blood water as a contrast tracer to measure blood flow change, which is highly associated with brain function."" Wang and colleagues studied 18 concussed players and 19 non-concussed players. They obtained MRI of the concussed players within 24 hours of the injury and a follow-up MRI eight days after the injury and compared results with those of the non-concussed players. Clinical assessments were obtained for both groups at each time point, as well as at the baseline before the football season. The concussed players demonstrated significant impairment on clinical assessment at 24 hours post-injury, but returned to baseline levels at eight days. In contrast to clinical manifestation, the concussed players demonstrated a significant blood flow decrease at eight days relative to 24 hours post-injury, while the non-concussed players had no change in cerebral blood flow between the two time points. ""In eight days, the concussed athletes showed clinical recovery,"" Wang said. ""However, MRI showed that even those in clinical recovery still had neurophysiological abnormalities. Neurons under such a state of physiologic stress function abnormally and may become more susceptible to second injury."" While the reasons for reduced cerebral blood flow in concussed athletes are still under investigation, the findings may have important implications for decisions on when athletes are ready to return to play after head injuries, according to the study's principal investigator, Michael McCrea, PhD, professor of neurosurgery and neurology and director of brain injury research the Medical College of Wisconsin. ""For years, we've relied on what athletes are telling us,"" McCrea said. ""We need something more objective, and this technology may provide a greater measurement of recovery."" The Medical College of Wisconsin scientists are continuing their research as one of the Phase II winners of the Head Health Challenge, an initiative from the National Football League and General Electric to develop ways to speed diagnosis and improve treatment for concussion. McCrea and his team are also co-chairing the Concussion Assessment, Research and Education Consortium (CARE) project, a major national US effort that will enroll more than 30,000 college athletes, making it the largest study of concussions to date. ""The nature of this research allows us to study the mechanisms of injury and recovery directly in humans rather than in animal models,"" McCrea said.

The results, published in Nature Communications, suggest that low levels of BRCA1 protein in the brain may contribute to dementia. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH, USA). ""It's extremely interesting that one molecule can be critically involved in two apparently opposing conditions: cancer, in which too many cells are born and neurodegenerative disease, in which too many brain cells die off,"" said senior author Lennart Mucke, MD, director of the Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease, San Francisco, and the Joseph B. Martin Distinguished Professor of Neuroscience, and professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco. Mucke and colleagues suspected that defects in DNA repair mechanisms could contribute to cognitive decline in AD and focused their studies on BRCA1. BRCA1 plays a key role in repairing our genetic code and thus, is critical for cell survival. When Mucke's group examined brains of patients who died with Alzheimer's, they discovered low levels of BRCA1. In addition, they found reductions of BRCA1 in the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer's. In fact, experimental reduction of BRCA1 levels in brains of healthy mice made their brain cells shrink and become dysfunctional. The team also investigated the effects of BRCA1 on cognition. After researchers reduced BRCA1 levels in the brains of healthy mice, the animals developed problems with learning and memory. Mouse models of Alzheimer's showed even greater declines in learning and memory following reductions of BRCA1. In addition, lowering BRCA1 caused increased DNA damage in the brains of Alzheimer's mice. One of the hallmarks of AD is accumulation of beta-amyloid protein fragments which are toxic and can lead to neuronal death. Mucke's team found that adding amyloid beta to neurons in a dish lowered levels of BRCA1. According to the researchers, the findings suggest that accumulation of beta-amyloid lowers levels of BRCA1, which increases DNA damage in brain cells and may contribute to dementia. ""An emerging theme in neurodegeneration research is that normal DNA repair protects against damage that causes neurons to die in dementia and related disorders. This study supports and strengthens that theme by showing that beta-amyloid decreases the levels of the DNA repair gene BRCA1, and at the same time inhibits the ability to form new memories,"" said Roderick Corriveau, PhD, program director at NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which provided funding for the study.

It is one of the leading causes of death and disability connected to the country s recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Many of these patients were evacuated by air from these countries to Europe and the U.S. for further treatment. In general, these patients were flown quickly to hospitals outside the battle zone, where more extensive treatment was available. But now a new study by researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine has found evidence that such air evacuations may pose a significant added risk, potentially causing more damage to already injured brains. The study is the first to suggest that air evacuation may be hazardous for TBI patients. The study is published in the Journal of Neurotrauma.  This research shows that exposure to reduced barometric pressure, as occurs on military planes used for evacuation, substantially worsens neurological function and increases brain cell loss after experimental TBI even when oxygen levels are kept in the normal range. It suggests that we need to carefully re-evaluate the cost-benefit of air transport in the first days after injury,  said lead researcher Alan Faden, MD, the David S. Brown Professor in Trauma in the Departments of Anesthesiology, Anatomy & Neurobiology, Neurology, and Neurosurgery, and director, Shock, Trauma and Anesthesiology Research Center (STAR) as well as the National Study Center for Trauma and Emergency Medical Services. About a quarter of all injured soldiers evacuated from Afghanistan and Iraq have suffered head injuries. Faden and his colleagues tested rats that were subjected to TBI, using a model that simulates key aspects of human brain injury. Animals were exposed to six hours of lowered air pressure, known as hypobaria, at levels that simulated conditions during transport; control animals were exposed to normal pressure. All the animals received extra oxygen to restore normal oxygen concentrations in the blood. In another study, animals received oxygen, either as in the first study or at much higher 100 percent concentration, which is often used during military air evacuations. On its own, low air pressure worsened long-term cognitive function and increased chronic brain inflammation and brain tissue loss. Pure oxygen further worsened outcomes. Faden and his colleagues believe the findings raise concerns about the increased use of relatively early air evacuation, and suggest that this potential risk should be weighed against the benefits of improved care after evacuation. It may be necessary, he says, to change the current policy for TBI patients and delaying air evacuation in many cases. In an accompanying editorial, Patrick Kochanek, MD, a leading expert on TBI and trauma care at the University of Pittsburgh, called the findings  highly novel and eye-opening,  and said that they could have  impactful clinical relevance for the field of traumatic brain injury in both military and civilian applications.  Faden and colleagues believe that one of the mechanisms by which hypobaria worsens TBI is by increasing persistent brain inflammation after injury. They are currently examining how this process occurs and have tested treatments that can reduce the risks of air evacuation. Early results are promising. Scientists suspect that breathing pure oxygen could worsen TBI by increasing production of dangerous free radicals in the brain. After brain injury, these free radicals flood the site of injury, and pure oxygen may further boost these levels. Several recent studies from trauma centers, including from the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland Medical Center, have found evidence that using 100 percent oxygen in trauma patients may be counterproductive. The research was funded by the U.S. Air Force.  This research has the potential to connect bench to bedside in an important, potentially lifesaving way,  said Dean E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, who is also Vice President of Medical Affairs, the University of Maryland and the John Z. and Akiko Bowers Distinguished Professor.

The new method uses genetically modified fluorescing E. coli cells to measure microbial growth rates, and works very much the same way as the ""mark and recapture"" practices that ecologists have long been using to estimate population levels of animals in the wild. The programming of E. coli to count gastrointestinal microbe growth rates is another advance for the field of synthetic biology, which largely aims to harness and re wire cellular machinery for carrying out specific functions via genetic and metabolic engineering. The Wyss and HMS team is calling the method ""distributed cell division counting"", or DCDC for short. ""The dream in this field is to make cell based computers, using cells that can remember, count, sense, actuate and complete tasks in a programmable way,"" said Pamela Silver, Ph.D., who is senior author on the new study, a Wyss Institute Core Faculty member on the Institute's Synthetic Biology platform, the Eliot T. and Onie H. Adams Professorship of Biochemistry and Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School (HMS), and a founder of the HMS Department of Systems Biology. ""This advance brings us another step closer to making that original dream a reality."" Gut microbes   which collectively contain a vast amount of genetic information known as the ""microbiome"" - play hugely important roles in the lives of their hosts. These microbes undergo dynamic shifts in their rates of growth depending upon factors like host diet or the presence of antibiotics. Gaining a window into these fluctuating dynamics helps scientists understand how microbes grow and divide inside our guts during infection, antibiotic therapy, and other microbial imbalances caused by health issues such as irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and cancer, which could help identify future therapies for treating these conditions. But in gastrointestinal microbiome research, an area rife with new discoveries and opportunities thanks to recent breakthroughs in our understanding of how influential these microbes are to our health, it has until now been very difficult to monitor microbial cells during their travels through mammalian gastrointestinal tracts. Microbial growth rates fluctuate in response to diet, wellness, exercise and the environment, and are affected by inter organism competition inside the gut. Yet after entering the gut and before exiting, microbes pass through the ""dark zone"", where they cannot be accessed or analyzed using standard methods and without disrupting observation of natural conditions. That challenge inspired Cameron Myhrvold, a Hertz graduate fellow at the Wyss Institute and Harvard Medical School and the lead author on the new study, to work with Silver to develop the novel synthetic ""mark and recapture"" technique known as DCDC. Using a genetically engineered red colored fluorescent protein controlled by a gene expression promoter as a visual flag, Myhrvold set out to quite literally mark and recapture E. coli, which are extremely common bacteria found in all mammalian guts. The DCDC strategy   in which mice were fed the genetically engineered microbes and then their waste collected for analysis   enabled the team to precisely count the bacterial cell divisions that occurred inside the mice's gastrointestinal tracts. The fluorescing protein ""marked"" the first generation of E. coli introduced to the gut and therefore allowed the team to calculate the population dynamics by analyzing the proportion of fluorescing cells versus the entire population of cells collected after their ""recapture"". ""Many different approaches to managing gastrointestinal health   such as the use of antibiotics, probiotics, genetically engineered bacteria, and therapeutics   rely on us being able to tell how these treatments affect the growth, division and death of certain microbial populations in our guts,"" said Myhrvold. ""Until now, we've been lacking a way to measure how growth dynamics are affected by our interventions."" A major new finding resulting from the study is that initial E. coli cell death in the gut plays a key role in the long term survival of those E. coli populations and helps them persist against competition from other microbial strains, which was surprising to the team. Using a mathematical model developed from their experimental results in mice, the team determined that while initially many microbes die upon entering the gut, over time their growth rate stabilizes as they adapt to the gut environment. The DCDC method, which could be adapted to monitor a wide range of microbes, could be applied broadly in gastrointestinal research to illuminate what happens in the ""dark zone"" of mammalian guts when diet, environment, and health conditions change or experimental interventions are introduced. ""This innovation could help us gain a better understanding of the microbes that comprise the microbiome, which live inside us and contribute so significantly to our health. It also is a harbinger of an entirely new class of 'cellular devices'   literally comprised of living cells   which can be programmed to sense and respond at will,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at HMS and Boston Children's Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A.

In this study, the scientists have shown that moving from a forest habitat to an urban environment has a profound impact on the epigenetic patterns of the immune response. Conversely, the different historical lifestyles of these populations   sedentary farming or nomadic hunting and gathering   are likely to affect more lasting functions, such as those associated with development, by modulating their genetic control via natural selection. How do humans adapt to their environment, for example their habitat (forest, rural or urban) and their lifestyle (nomadic hunting and gathering or sedentary farming)? Over the course of human evolution, the environment has exerted selective pressure, resulting in the selection of genetic mutations that are beneficial for our species. Scientists from the Human Evolutionary Genetics Unit (Institut Pasteur/CNRS URA 3012), directed by Lluis Quintana-Murci, CNRS director of research at the Institut Pasteur, have recently proven that the habitat and lifestyle of human populations can also have an epigenetic impact, by bringing about changes that modulate gene expression. Unlike genetics, which looks at the sequence of the nucleic acids that make up DNA and carry our genes, epigenetics focuses on elements which don't alter the genetic sequence but which may affect gene expression. For this research, the scientists examined epigenetic changes to DNA such as methylation, in which methyl chemical groups are added to the gene sequence. To determine the extent to which the environment influences the epigenome, the scientists looked at two populations in Central Africa with different lifestyles and habitats: Pygmies, who are nomadic hunter-gatherers living in forests, and Bantu, sedentary farmers in urban, rural or forest habitats. These two populations separated approximately 60,000 years ago. The scientists also investigated a particular group of Bantu farmers sharing the same forest environment as Pygmies. The scientists began by comparing the level of genomic methylation in this specific group of forest-dwelling Bantu with that of urban or rural Bantu. They observed that the recent change in habitat had resulted in changes to the epigenome that mainly affected the functions of the immune system. At the same time, they compared the methylation of the forest-dwelling Bantu with that of the Pygmies, this time to examine the impact of their lifestyles (the Bantu are farmers, while the Pygmies are hunter-gatherers). The scientists identified differences in the epigenome relating to development (size, bone mineralization, etc.). They observed that these changes affected the physical characteristics that set Bantu apart from Pygmies. They therefore referred to these differences as ""historical"". Although epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation can be strongly affected by the environment, they are not passed on from generation to generation. However, they can become hereditary when they are controlled by a mutation in the DNA. The researchers proved that the ""recent"" changes to the epigenome which affect immunity did not involve genetic control, whereas the ""historical"" differences did include an element of genetic control, making them hereditary and long-lasting. These results partly explain why some people are predisposed to certain diseases. ""Our research shows that changing lifestyles and habitats have a major influence on our epigenome and that urbanization significantly affects the epigenetic profiles of the immune system. This demonstrates how important it is, alongside more traditional genetic research, to investigate how epigenetic changes could result in an immune system that is more prone to the development of autoimmune diseases, allergies, inflammation and so on,"" explains Lluis Quintana-Murci. This type of study, which combines population genetics and epigenetics, may soon be applied to other populations so as to identify which biological functions are most affected by our increasingly changing environments, lifestyles and habitats.","Published: December 1, 2015"

""Seeds bred to account for the difference between growing organically and conventionally could improve farm yields and marketing potential for produce, yet organic seeds available to farmers are rarely developed with these organic management considerations in mind,"" said Charlie Brummer, director of the UC Davis Plant Breeding Center and coordinator of the new organic breeding project. Studies show that plant varieties developed under organic conditions can out-perform those developed under conventional conditions, Brummer said. The new breeding effort, funded at just under $1 million by the Organic Research and Extension Initiative of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, will develop new cultivars on certified organic land at the Student Farm, a program of the Agricultural Sustainability Institute at UC Davis. Breeding programs will be led by graduate students as part of their hands-on training to be plant breeders. ""When we started the Plant Breeding Center in 2014, we wanted to give our plant-breeding students experience with real cultivar development projects that would result in products that growers and seed producers would want,"" Brummer said. ""This project lets us put those pieces together in a very meaningful and exciting way."" He noted that there are myriad genetic traits that apply specifically to organic agriculture. For example, because organic farmers tend to rely on nonchemical methods to control pests and supply nutrients, natural resistance to pests and adaptability to organic soil conditions are important traits for crops grown organically. And increasingly, organic growers also need crop varieties that meet specific market niches, to clearly differentiate their products. Partnering with organic growers UC Davis has a long history of plant-breeding projects, but few have focused on organic seed or vegetable production until now. ""I see this as a real opportunity to build bridges between UC Davis breeding programs and organic farmers, which I anticipate will grow well beyond this project,"" says Jared Zystro, assistant director of research and education at Organic Seed Alliance, an industry partner on the project. ""One of the great things about partnership with the university is the expertise that breeders bring in their particular crops. That expertise is coupled with the thinking about how to efficiently execute the breeding process."" Opportunities for students and community UC Davis graduate students will be taught the breeding process to help prepare them for plant-breeding careers. Student breeders will work at the Student Farm, a farm-scale campus facility with 35 years of field-based teaching and research on organic farming. They also will collaborate with farmers and the organic seed industry to understand specific breeding needs and conduct on-farm trials to determine if potential cultivars have merit. ""This project is exciting because of its focus on actually trying to release cultivars,"" says Zystro, a plant breeder himself. ""That's an experience that graduate students rarely get in their educations."" Mark Van Horn, director of the Student Farm, said that in addition to training graduate students, the new project would showcase organic breeding to the surrounding community.

The model helps to demonstrate how two dynamic processes the movement of pigment cells across the skin, and the birth and death of cells as the fish grows combine to keep zebrafish stripes in line. Zebrafish have become quite a popular model organism for biology researchers over the past few decades. The small freshwater fish begin life as transparent embryos and develop in just a few months to full size, giving scientists the chance to watch their development in detail. The emergence of their namesake stripes of dark blue and bright yellow has been the subject of much research. The stripes have been shown to be the result of interplay between three types of pigment cells: black melanophores, yellow xanthophores, and silvery iridophores.  The stripe pattern forms dynamically as the fish develops,  said Alexandria Volkening, a graduate student and Brown s Division of Applied Mathematics and the lead author on the new paper.  It s not like these pigment cells are filling out some kind of prepattern that s already there. It s the interactions of the cells over time that causes the patterns to form. We wanted to build a model that simulates this based as much as possible on what s known about the biology.  The model Volkening developed treats cells as individual agents, behaving according to a set of rules derived from experiments. It directly incorporates two types of cells: the black melanophores and the yellow xanthophores. The effects of the third cell type, the iridophores, are implicit in the behavior of the other two cells, though the iridophores themselves are not physically included in the model. The model starts with melanophores and xanthophores arranged in a way that mimics the arrangement of cells in fish just a few weeks old. The model domain then grows in a way that approximates the growth of the fish. As the domain grows, new cells are added that mimic the stem cells from which pigments are derived in actual fish. The stem cells take cues on which type of cell to become from existing pigment cells. Those cues come both from cells in the immediate vicinity, and from cells further away. Experiments in actual fish have suggested that both short- and long-distance communication is important. In the model, if a new stem cell is surrounded by black cells and the adjacent developing stripe regions are yellow, it has a much greater chance of becoming a dark cell itself. The same goes for yellow cells. Cell death is controlled by similar mechanism. A black cell surrounded on all sides by light ones or without sufficient yellow cells in adjacent stripe regions has a much higher probability of dying.  Experiments have shown that pigment cells also have the ability to move short distances across the fish s skin, and the model captures that dynamic as well. The pigments are thought to move according to cues communicated from surrounding cells. In the model, all of the cells repel each other, but different cell types have a stronger repulsion than like cells. The movement cues are gathered from the cells immediately surrounding a pigment cell. Cell movement as well as the birth and death of cells are critical to stripe formation. Restricting movement produces stripes that point in no particular direction (left) while restricting cell birth and death creates spots (right). Using these rules over the normal growth period of an actual fish, model was able to successfully recreate the development of stripes as seen in experiments. It was also able to recreate the results of a variety of experiments biologists have done to perturb stripe formation. For example, scientists have ablated pigment cells early in a fish s development to see how it would affect stripe development. Those experiments showed that when cells are knocked out, the fish form oblong spots rather then stripes as they continue to develop. The model was able to recreate those effects. Once they had a model that could reconstruct actual experiments, the researchers could test how different cellular dynamics influence stripe growth.  One thing that s not clear is the role of birth and death versus movement. Do you need both or just one?  said Bjorn Sandstede, chair of Brown s Division of Applied Mathematics and a co-author of the paper.  What we can do in the model is turn off one of the two and see what we get.  With movement turned off, the model showed that cells formed oblong blobs with no particular orientation. With birth and death turned off, like cells formed tightly packed spots rather than stripes. Taken together, the results help to confirm the interdependent dynamics of the two processes in the development of the stripe pattern. Sandstede says that simulations like these are important because they offer a window into how complex patterns and structures form dynamically in nature.  If you look at any kind of organism, they start with oocytes, which are roundish structures with little spatial differentiation at all, and you end up with organisms like us that have a complex spatial structure,  he said.  I think it s important to try to understand how spatial differentiation occurs. Zebrafish and their stripes are a good model to do that because you can identify the different cells and what they re doing in the process.  Volkening says she plans to continue to refine the model to better capture the effects of iridophores that were not directly included in the current model. She hopes the model can serve as a guide for future experiments in actual fish.  One of the benefits of the models is that we can do this in six minutes,  she said.  It takes weeks to grow the fish,  Volkening said.","Published: December 1, 2015"

The molecule   called Absent in Melanoma 2, or AIM2   detects the DNA of harmful microorganisms (pathogens) and regulates inflammation in the gut. AIM2 is present in all immune and epithelial cells, which make up a large part of the intestine s cell population and help to maintain a healthy gut. Findings from the new study, published online in Cell Reports, could someday be valuable in treating conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and colorectal cancer, said senior author Dr. Hasan Zaki, Assistant Professor of Pathology at UT Southwestern.  We ve shown in an animal model that AIM2 detects the cytosolic presence of microbial DNA in the gut,  Dr. Zaki said.  This detection activates cell-signaling pathways that produce antimicrobial peptides, suppress the growth of harmful bacteria, and maintain the integrity of the intestine s epithelial barrier.  Our findings also suggest that defects in AIM2 may alter DNA sensing and thus contribute to intestinal inflammatory disorders such as IBD, ulcerative colitis, Crohn s disease, and colorectal cancer,  he said.  By extension, manipulation of the AIM2 signaling pathway may be a promising treatment option for these conditions.  The healthy human intestine is populated with trillions of microorganisms (collectively referred to as the microbiota)   some that are beneficial to our health and some that induce disease. The immune system s ability to detect and kill the pathogens while preserving the beneficial microorganisms is vital to intestinal health. The immune system maintains homeostasis   the proper balance   of bacteria in our gut, said Dr. Zaki, and the AIM2 pathway is a central part of this maintenance.  When AIM2 detects the DNA of pathogens in immune and epithelial cells, the protein activates a molecular machine called the inflammasome,  he explained.  The inflammasome in turn activates the enzyme caspase-1, which then produces two proteins (IL-1  and IL-18) that play important roles in the GI tract, including activation of immune cells, induction of antimicrobial peptides, and regulation of epithelial cell proliferation.   Defects in AIM2-mediated inflammasome activation lead to growth of IBD-causing bacteria like E. coli, as well as dysregulated inflammation and compromised healing of intestinal injury,  Dr. Zaki said. Although more research is necessary, these findings have promising implications for the treatment of bacteria- and inflammation-related gastrointestinal illnesses, including IBDs and colitis-associated colorectal cancer.  AIM2 may be a future therapeutic target to regulate altered microbiota and dysregulated inflammation in the GI system,  said Dr. Zaki.","Published: December 1, 2015"

To create that intricate network, fly embryonic cells must sprout  fingers  and crawl into place. Now researchers at The Johns Hopkins University have discovered that a protein called Mipp1 is key to cells  ability to grow these fingers. A summary of the research, which has implications for understanding normal and abnormal development of human and other animal tissues, was recently published online.   Fruit flies don t have blood to bring oxygen to their cells,  says Deborah Andrew, Ph.D., professor of cell biology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  Instead, the tubes of the windpipe, or trachea, branch out repeatedly, getting thinner and thinner   like the tiny capillary blood vessels throughout our bodies   so that oxygen can diffuse directly from the trachea to nearby tissue.  Fruit flies are a research animal favorite among biologists because their genes and chemistry are relatively easy to manipulate, and because they can be easily and quickly bred. And since evolution highly conserves key biological events, what is learned in flies can shed light on the development of many species, including humans, Andrew notes. Andrew says two major ducts of the embryonic fruit fly trachea run parallel to each other along the length of the embryo. From these wide  dorsal trunks,  several thinner branches split off and grow toward the top of the embryo until they meet and merge in the middle, forming a contiguous network. Before and after elongating, the dorsal branches are just six interconnected cells. They start off stacked three high and wrapped around the thin tube connected to the dorsal trunk. In order to elongate the tube, the cells at the top grow fingerlike structures called filopodia that reach out and pull the cells away from the dorsal trunk. At the same time, the cells rearrange themselves to form a structure six cells high.  A few years ago, we discovered that in developing fly embryos, the protein Mipp1 is controlled by the master regulator gene that orchestrates all of tracheal development,  says Yim Ling Cheng, Ph.D., a cell biology postdoctoral fellow at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the primary author of the paper. At that point, the researchers knew that Mipp1 was an enzyme responsible for turning the molecule IP6 into IP3   two different chemical messengers   by breaking off three phosphate groups. They wanted to know why Mipp1 was in the trachea. By tracking its location in the trachea, they found that, at first, the protein is located throughout the developing tissue. But it soon becomes concentrated in the top pair of cells in the three-cell-high dorsal branches that are about to elongate. Those are the cells that grow filopodia, and when there was too much Mipp1, the research team saw too many filopodia. Too little Mipp1 resulted in too few filopodia and branches that were slow to elongate. Wondering if Mipp1 s presence in the top cells was the cause or a result of the cells  position, the researchers genetically manipulated the flies so that the dorsal branch cells would turn on the Mipp1 gene at random. They expected Mipp1 to then be found in the six positions of the branch at random, but instead they found that in the top two cells, it was present more than three times as frequently as in other cells. That suggests, says Andrew, that Mipp1 makes cells more likely to climb to the top, where they are needed to elongate the branches. The team learned from further experiments that Mipp1 decorates the outside edge   not the interiors   of the top cells in the tracheal branches, where it converts IP6 into IP3, but they wonder how exactly that influences finger growth. They hope to find out in their ongoing experiments.","Published: December 1, 2015"

The scientists show gap regions within the folds of DNA that have a crucial effect on turning genes on and controlling their expression, actually physically interact with genes not previously thought to be important in disease.  Many of these genes are now thought to increase the risk of people developing diseases such as arthritis, psoriasis and type 1 diabetes. Lead researcher Dr Stephen Eyre from The University of Manchester said:  It used to be the case that researchers would seek to identify a gene which caused a particular disease by a  nearest gene  approach, to the gap regions.  The reality is much more complex than that.  Not only do the gaps between genes have an effect but, as we show in the new study, the gaps don t necessarily affect the nearest gene   they can work over longer distances to turn distant genes on or off.  This process is caused by the folding of the two metre DNA to make it fit within a cell. This folding, brings gap regions close to the  more important  regions, and therefore controls the levels of genes. In certain parts of the folded DNA, regions that increase risk to different diseases can  meet  at the same gene. By gaining a better understanding of this process we open up many more possibilities for research into cures and treatments in the years ahead. The findings also open up the possibility that some genes may be increasing the risk of more than one disease, depending on how they are regulated by the gaps and from where in the DNA structure.  This knowledge could lead to greater understanding of the diseases and insights into potential treatments.  The next steps in the research are to identify more of these complex interactions and in different types of cell in order to build a more complete picture of how genes and gaps interact to increase disease risk.  Dr Eyre added:  This research shows just how complicated the interactions within our cells are   much more so than was previously thought.  However, by gaining a better understanding of this process we open up many more possibilities for research into cures and treatments in the years ahead. ","Published: December 1, 2015"

A team of Toronto researchers, led by Professor Jason Moffat from the University of Toronto s Donnelly Centre, with a contribution from Stephane Angers from the Faculty of Pharmacy, have switched off, one by one, almost 18,000 genes, 90 per cent of the entire human genome, to find the genes that are essential for cell survival. The data revealed a  core  set of more than 1,500 essential genes. This lays the foundation for reaching the long-standing goal in biomedical research of pinpointing a role for every single gene in the genome.By turning genes off in five different cancer cell lines, including brain, retinal, ovarian, and two kinds of colorectal cancer cells, the team uncovered that each tumour relies on a unique set of genes that can be targeted by specific drugs. The finding raises hope of devising new treatments that would target only cancer cells, leaving the surrounding healthy tissue unharmed.  It s when you get outside the core set of essential genes, that it starts to get interesting in terms of how to target particular genes in different cancers and other disease states,  says Moffat, who is also a professor in the department of molecular genetics and a Senior Fellow at the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR). Sequencing of the human genome 12 years ago allowed scientists to compile a list of parts   our 20,000 genes   that make up our cells and bodies. Despite this major achievement, we still didn t understand the function of each gene, or how some genes make us sick when they go wrong. To do this, scientists realized they would have to switch genes off, one by one across the entire genome to determine what processes go wrong in the cells. But the available tools were either inaccurate or too slow. The recent arrival of the gene editing technology CRISPR has finally made it possible to turn genes off, swiftly and with pinpoint accuracy, kicking off a global race among multiple competing research teams. The Toronto study, along with the paper from Harvard and MIT found that roughly 10 per cent of our genes are essential for cell survival. These findings show the majority of human genes play more subtle roles in the cell because switching them off doesn t kill the cell. But if two or more of such genes are mutated at the same time, or the cells are under environmental stress, their loss begins to count. Because different cancers have different mutations, they tend to rely on different sets of genes to survive. Moffatt s team have identified distinct sets of  smoking gun  genes for each of the tested cancers   each set susceptible to different drugs.  We can now interrogate our genome at unprecedented resolution in human cells that we grow in the lab with incredible speed and accuracy. In short order, this will lead to a functional map of cancer that will link drug targets to DNA sequence variation,  says Moffat. His team has already shown how this can work. In his study, metformin, a widely prescribed diabetes drugs successfully killed brain cancer cells and those of one form of colorectal cancer   but was useless against the other cancers he studied. However, the antibiotics chloramphenicol and linezolid were effective against another form of colorectal cancer, and not against brain or other cancers studied. These data illustrate the clinical potential of the data in pointing to more precise treatments for the different cancers   and show the value of personalized medicine.  The Moffat group has developed a powerful CRISPR library that could be used by investigators around the world to identify new treatment strategies for the treatment of cancer,  says Aaron Schimmer, a professor in the department of medical biophysics and a medical oncologist at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, who was not involved in the study.  I would be interested in using this tool to identify new treatment approaches for acute myeloid leukemia   a blood cancer with a high mortality rate. ","Published: December 1, 2015"

This opens the door to new therapeutic options in the treatment of breast cancer, report the researchers. In nearly every fifth breast cancer patient, an above-average number of HER2 receptors are located on the surface of the tumor cells. These receptors are molecules that send growth factor signals into the cell. The overabundance of receptors causes the cancer cells to divide rapidly and the tumor grows faster than average. For some years now, a new class of drugs called antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have been used, which work in two ways: they consist of an antibody that binds selectively to the tumor cell receptor and interrupts the signal to propagate; they also act as a transport vehicle for a chemical substance that enters the cancer cells with the antibody and triggers their death. The researchers demonstrate that the use of specific cytotoxic substances can also have a beneficial effect on the body s immune system. Combination with immunotherapy Researchers, led by Prof. Alfred Zippelius at the Department of Biomedicine, from the University and University Hospital Basel have now gone one step further: in a pre-clinical study performed in mouse breast cancer models, they combined the ADC  trastuzumab emtansine  with an additional immunotherapy that activates the immune system into attacking tumors more efficiently. They focused on what is known as immunoregulatory checkpoints. These are receptors on immune cells, which control for example effector T-cells by dampening their activation if damage to healthy cells is imminent. By administering a complementary antibody, they blocked the function of two such immune checkpoints, whereby different types of endogenous T-cells were activated. On its own, this immune response had no immediate effect in the fight against the utilized breast tumors, but in combination with the ADC it proved itself effective in attacking cancer cells in mice, resulting in the complete cure of the majority of mice receiving the combination therapy. The researchers were also able to further demonstrate that regulatory T-cells play a host protective role in this therapeutic setting. Their removal resulted in excessive inflammation and tissue damage.  Our results clearly demonstrate that antibody-drug conjugates are suitable for use in a combination therapy, opening new perspectives for the treatment of breast cancer,  says lead author Dr. Philipp M ller on the significance of the study.","Published: December 1, 2015"

When parasites from refugia mix with their drug-resistant counterparts in the general population, they could reduce the incidence of drug-resistance overall, which may help prolong a drug's effectiveness. The research offers a way to assess when such an approach is likely to work--information that could help in the increasingly urgent hunt for alternatives to the current suite of parasite-fighting drugs. ""Once resistance emerges, you might squeeze a little bit of life out of a drug by tweaking it, but often, very quickly, that entire class of drugs will become useless,"" said Andrew Park, an associate professor in the UGA Odum School of Ecology and College of Veterinary Medicine, who led the research.""Right now, we're really struggling to manage diseases like MRSA and extensively drug-resistant TB,"" he said. ""We're at a point where new classes of drugs don't grow on trees anymore; it can take 15 to 20 years to develop them. It's a challenge just to keep pace. Refugia represent a management strategy that's being considered as a way to slow down the development of drug resistance, particularly in animal health."" Park and his colleagues created a model to predict the effects of refugia on two important outcomes: the overall prevalence of infection within a population and the proportion of those infections that are drug-resistant. The model incorporates two main variables. One is the level of drug coverage--the proportion of the overall population that has been treated against parasites. The other is the degree of mixing between the treated and untreated groups. In the case of a disease like heartworm, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and infects both wild animal populations and companion animals, there is some natural variation in both drug coverage and mixing. Both variables can also be controlled, to an extent. ""There might be variation in terms of how compliant animal owners are in giving heartworm preventive and whether dogs are kept indoors a lot versus just allowed to run around outside,"" Park said. In this case, the mixing is unintentional rather than planned. ""Given that it's happening, we should at least understand what the consequences might be for drug resistance,"" he said. The model yielded predictions about how changing the levels of drug coverage and mixing would affect prevalence and resistance, and also shed light on the evolutionary processes at work. ""The dogma is that increasing contact between treated and untreated groups would be predicted to simply increase prevalence and decrease frequency of resistance, but we found that the relationships were much more complex than that,"" Park said. ""And we gained a lot of insight into the different roles of selection--how different strains are favored because of the host environment--and gene flow, the movement of drug resistant and drug susceptible parasites between host groups."" Park said that his team's model serves as a general outline for considering the use of refugia as a management strategy, providing a blueprint for future models to predict outcomes in specific host-parasite systems. ""With refugia, the idea is to dilute overall drug resistance,"" Park said. ""We can say, yes, we're putting parasites into the population, but they're the right kind of parasites, and in some cases that may be better than having it just flooded with the wrong kind of parasites that we can never treat. But we need this kind of model to understand all these interactions in order to know when that's a good idea.""","Published: December 1, 2015"

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.  It s extremely interesting that one molecule can be critically involved in two apparently opposing conditions: cancer, in which too many cells are born and neurodegenerative disease, in which too many brain cells die off,  said senior author Lennart Mucke, M.D., director of the Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease, San Francisco, and the Joseph B. Martin Distinguished Professor of Neuroscience, and professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Mucke and his colleagues suspected that defects in DNA repair mechanisms could contribute to cognitive decline in AD and focused their studies on BRCA1. BRCA1 plays a key role in repairing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), our genetic code. DNA is a double helix structure that is made of two strands and resembles a twisted ladder. Occasionally, one or both of the strands will develop breaks, which are fixed by DNA repair proteins including BRCA1. This process is critical for cell survival because if DNA is not repaired properly, the cell may die. When Dr. Mucke s group examined brains of patients who died with Alzheimer s, they discovered low levels of BRCA1. In addition, the researchers found reductions of BRCA1 in the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer s. In fact, experimental reduction of BRCA1 levels in brains of healthy mice made their brain cells shrink and become dysfunctional. Dr. Mucke s team also investigated the effects of BRCA1 on cognition.  After researchers reduced BRCA1 levels in the brains of healthy mice, the animals developed problems with learning and memory. Mouse models of Alzheimer s showed even greater declines in learning and memory following reductions of BRCA1. In addition, lowering BRCA1 caused increased DNA damage in the brains of Alzheimer s mice. One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer s disease is accumulation of a protein fragment known as beta-amyloid, which is toxic to brain cells and can lead to neuronal death. Dr. Mucke s team found that adding amyloid beta to neurons in a dish lowered levels of BRCA1. According to Dr. Mucke and his colleagues, the findings suggest that accumulation of beta-amyloid lowers levels of BRCA1, which increases DNA damage in brain cells and may contribute to dementia.  An emerging theme in neurodegeneration research is that normal DNA repair protects against damage that causes neurons to die in dementia and related disorders. This study supports and strengthens that theme by showing that beta-amyloid decreases the levels of the DNA repair gene BRCA1, and at the same time inhibits the ability to form new memories,  said Roderick Corriveau, Ph.D., program director at NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which provided funding for the study.  The functions of BRCA1 in the brain remain to be fully elucidated,  said Dr. Mucke,  but our findings suggest that it may play an important role in supporting critical brain functions in both health and disease.  Further research is necessary to determine whether BRCA1 may be a potential therapeutic target for treating dementia, and whether BRCA1 mutations that lead to cancer also affect brain function.","Published: December 1, 2015"

Many people with Down syndrome have Alzheimer s-related brain changes in their 30s that can lead to dementia in their 50s and 60s. Little is known about how the disease progresses in this vulnerable group. The NIH Biomarkers of Alzheimer s Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome Initiative will support teams of researchers using brain imaging, as well as fluid and tissue biomarkers in research that may one day lead to effective interventions for all people with dementia. The studies will be funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), both part of NIH. The institutes are jointly providing an estimated $37 million over five years to two highly collaborative projects, which enlist a number of leading researchers to the effort. To advance Alzheimer s research worldwide, the teams will make their data and samples freely available to qualified researchers.  This is the first large-scale Alzheimer s biomarker endeavor to focus on this high-risk group,  said Laurie Ryan, Ph.D., chief of the Dementias of Aging Branch in NIA s Division of Neuroscience, which leads NIH research on Alzheimer s.  Much like the long-established Alzheimer s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the goal of this initiative is to develop biomarker measures that signal the onset and progression of Alzheimer s in people with Down syndrome. Hopefully, one day, we will also use these biomarkers to determine the effectiveness of promising treatments.  The link between Alzheimer s and Down syndrome is well-known. People with Down syndrome are born with an extra copy of chromosome 21, which contains the amyloid precursor protein gene. This gene plays a role in the production of harmful amyloid plaque, sticky clumps that build up outside neurons in Alzheimer s disease. Having three copies of this gene is a known risk factor for early-onset Alzheimer s that can occur in people in their 30s, 40s and 50s. By middle age, most but not all adults with Down syndrome develop signs of Alzheimer s, and a high percentage go on to develop symptoms of dementia as they age into their 70s. The initiative establishes funding for two research teams that will pool data and standardize procedures, increase sample size, and collectively analyze data that will be made widely available to the research community. The teams will employ an array of biomarkers to identify and track Alzheimer s-related changes in the brain and cognition for over 500 Down syndrome volunteers, aged 25 and older. The measures include:   Positron emission tomography (PET) scans that track levels of amyloid and glucose (energy used by brain cells); MRI of brain volume and function; and levels of amyloid and tau in cerebrospinal fluid and blood;  Blood tests to identify biomarkers in blood, including proteins, lipids and markers of inflammation;  Blood tests to collect DNA for genome-wide association studies that identify the genetic factors that may confer risk, or protect against, developing Alzheimer s;  Evaluations of medical conditions and cognitive and memory tests to determine levels of function and monitor any changes;  For the first time in people with Down syndrome, PET brain scans that detect levels of tau, the twisted knots of protein within brain cells that are a hallmark Alzheimer s disease. Aside from earlier onset, Alzheimer s in people with Down syndrome is similar to Alzheimer s in others. The first symptom may be memory loss, although people with Down syndrome initially tend to show behavior changes and problems with walking.  Over the past 30 years, the average lifespan of people with Down syndrome has doubled to 60 years a bittersweet achievement when faced with the possibility of developing Alzheimer s,  said Melissa Parisi, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the NICHD Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Branch, which leads NIH s Down syndrome research.  There is much to learn about Alzheimer s in Down syndrome, and we re hopeful that these new projects will provide some answers. One mystery we hope to solve is whether or not the disease progresses at a faster rate in this group.  Parisi noted that research into Alzheimer s in Down syndrome is a key focus of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer s Disease, which calls for improved care for specific populations that are unequally burdened by the disease, including people with Down syndrome, and for increased research that may lead to possible Alzheimer s therapies.","Published: December 1, 2015"

Owlstone s chemical detection technology is being developed to measure the trace chemicals present in the breath of lung cancer patients. The quick and easy to use breath test technology has the potential to detect cases earlier, and allow more effective and less expensive treatments. The project estimates it will save the NHS  82m each year. Inotec AMD is developing an oxygen therapy device for non-healing diabetic foot ulcers. Diabetic foot ulceration currently costs the NHS around  540m per year. In the UK, and globally, there is an epidemic of diabetes and these costs are set to spiral upwards rapidly in the coming years. This continuous day and night treatment can be used to heal or reduce the size of diabetic ulcers whilst the patient carries on with normal life. The two Cambridge-based companies have benefitted from reforms made in Brussels and championed by Vicky Ford, which have enabled small companies to co-develop solutions for large public sector buyers such as the NHS. Both technologies have been developed with support from SBRI Healthcare funding. Vicky Ford said,  This breath test is effective and cost effective and is a credit to the scientists involved. Also deserving much praise are the local NHS staff who are determined to improve cancer detection and are seeking new solutions to assist their cause. So much innovation comes from small companies which is why I worked for rule change and these projects I believe are just the start of what can be done.  Karen Livingstone, Director of Strategic Partnerships and Industry Engagement for the Eastern AHSN (the organization with the responsibility for innovation and best practice adoption across the NHS in the east) commented:  The NHS knows it can improve outcomes for patients through the use of new technologies and innovations. Through the SBRI Healthcare programme we are able to fund the development of new technologies to address known needs. The SBRI Healthcare programme was initially funded with EU support but we have grown this Eastern success story into a national award winning programme.  Eastern AHSN is supporting these companies to complete the development of their products and see their introduction into the NHS to improve patient care. In addition to enhanced health outcomes we will also see economic value and jobs brought to the eastern region as a consequence of this work. ","Published: December 1, 2015"

The team, which was led by researchers at the University of Exeter Medical School, King's College London and Cardiff University, conducted the first study of how genetic variation influences DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification that can have direct effects on gene expression and function, in the developing brain. In research published in Nature Neuroscience and funded by the Medical Research Council, they demonstrated the potential utility of such data for refining the genetic signals associated with diseases hypothesized to have a neurodevelopmental component, such as schizophrenia. DNA methylation is a chemical modification to one of the four bases that make up our genetic code, controlling when and where genes are expressed. As with other epigenetic marks, it is known to be dynamic across the life course and modifiable by a number of factors, including the underlying genetic sequence. It represents one possible pathway between genetic variation and disease, with genetic differences altering the regulation of gene expression at specific points in development. In this study the authors found that genetic variants associated with schizophrenia were enriched for changes that impact upon DNA methylation in the developing brain. It is of particular interest that some of the genetic risk factors for schizophrenia are associated with differences in DNA methylation as early as the first and second trimester of life. Dr. Eilis Hannon, of the University of Exeter Medical School, commented: ""This data has particular relevance for disorders such as schizophrenia, where it is thought that changes early in brain development increase an individual's liability to develop the illness later on in life. Therefore understanding the genetic effects of risk variants on gene regulation during the earliest stages of brain development may point us towards the underlying biology of schizophrenia."" Professor Jonathan Mill, of the University of Exeter Medical School, who led the study, said: ""This study builds on the tremendous advances in identifying the genetic risks for schizophrenia in the last couple of years. We have shown that genetic variation can have significant effects on gene regulation during brain development, with important implications for understanding the origins of schizophrenia and other disorders with a neurodevelopmental component."" The data is freely available to the wider research community via an online database and will potentially facilitate the interpretation of genetic findings in studies of other neurodevelopmental disorders.

Legumes boost soil nitrate fertility by assimilating nitrogen from the air, recruiting soil bacteria to help   this is considerably more eco-friendly than the equivalent industrial process. Indeed, environmental concerns and climate change mitigation is putting red clover back in the spotlight. This requires genetic improvements to help boost its performance.  Red clover s chief benefits (alongside soil improvement) is to provide a protein-rich livestock feed   it also boosts omega-3 fatty acids in ruminant milk. Compared to white clover and other legumes, red clover has high levels of an enzyme that causes its  protein to be digested more slowly and effectively   it s more nutritious per mouthful. However, currently, red clover only grows well for two or three seasons and it does not recover well from grazing by livestock. It also does not lend itself easily to traditional crop breeding practices, with severe loss of vigour and fertility if inbred. An ongoing project at TGAC and IBERS aims to use a collection of diverse natural lines of red clover for breeding new elite varieties more tolerant to grazing, thus making it more persistent, and to understand the domestication process that led to the adoption of red clover as a crop.For the breeders, this draft genome provides a welcome tool, with which to speed up incorporation of traits that are beneficial for the clovers  use in sustainable agriculture from natural populations of red clover plants sampled from all over Europe. Widening of the genetic diversity of the breeding populations will help to make red clover a more robust and reliable crop. Therefore, the genome sequence promises to be a valuable platform for advances in studies of traits of biological and agronomic importance in forage crops.  Lead author Jose de Vega, Researcher at TGAC, said:  The publication of the red clover reference genome is an important milestone, as it represents the first genome sequence of the clover forage crops, which are key components of more sustainable livestock agriculture.   The availability of the genome assembly will pave the way towards genomics-assisted breeding methods for forage legumes, and provide a platform for deeper understanding of the genetics of forage crop domestication.   Red clover is attractive because of its high protein content, diversity and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, but to enhance its role in sustainable agriculture requires improvements in persistence, disease resistance, and tolerance to grazing.  Senior author and project leader Leif Sk t from the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS) at Aberystwyth University said:  The red clover genome puts us in a great position to incorporate and build on this resource. We work closely with Dr David Lloyd, IBERS forage legume breeder, so we are using our genomic tools to assist in improving the precision and speed of breeding better red clover varieties. This is very timely as the importance of legumes in sustainable agriculture is  rediscovered .   The collaboration between TGAC and IBERS reinforces the UK's leadership in translating the development of genetic and genomic resources from fundamental science to applications with a potential impact on the local and national economy .  The development of a more sustainable agriculture is a key aspect of the UK research strategy, positioning both Institute s as international leaders in biotechnology specifically in the area of forage legumes. This is delivering impact to a broad range of stakeholders and ensuring that the genomics resources will be translated to research and breeding programmes. The study entitled: ""Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) draft genome provides a platform for trait improvement"" is published in Scientific Reports, a journal of the Nature publishing group. This work results from the partnership between, TGAC, IBERS and Germinal Holdings LTD, part funded by the latter through TGAC Capacity and Capability Challenge (CCC) programme, and a Responsive Mode award from the BBSRC.

The pigeons were able to generalize what they had learned, so that when we showed them a completely new set of normal and cancerous digitized slides, they correctly identified them,  Levenson said.  Their accuracy, like that of humans, was modestly affected by the presence or absence of color in the images, as well as by degrees of image compression. The pigeons also learned to correctly identify cancer-relevant microcalcifications on mammograms, but they had a tougher time classifying suspicious masses on mammograms   a task that is extremely difficult, even for skilled human observers.  The pigeons  successes and difficulties provide a window into how physicians process visual cues present on slides and x-rays to diagnose and classify disease risk. This work also suggests that pigeons  remarkable ability to discriminate between complex visual images could be put to good use as trained medical image observers, to help researchers explore image quality and the impact of color, contrast, brightness, and image compression artifacts on diagnostic performance. Outstanding learners Although a pigeon s brain is no bigger than the tip of an index finger, it turns out that the neural pathways involved, including the basal ganglia and cortical-striatal synapses, operate in ways very similar to those at work in the human brain. According to Edward Wasserman, professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Iowa, co-author of the study, the common pigeon (Columba livia) has a tremendous capacity to discriminate and categorize a wide range of objects and images.  Research over the past 50 years has shown that pigeons can distinguish identities and emotional expressions on human faces, letters of the alphabet, misshapen pharmaceutical capsules, and even paintings by Monet vs. Picasso,  Wasserman said.  Their visual memory is equally impressive, with a proven recall of more than 1,800 images.  When Levenson learned about Wasserman s earlier research on the visual short-term memory capacities of pigeons and people, conducted with UC Davis Center for Mind and Brain Director Steven Luck, he wondered how pigeons would perform on pathology slides. And a new collaboration began. Pigeons especially adept at discriminating breast cancer slides For the study, each pigeon learned to discriminate cancerous from non-cancerous images and slides using traditional  operant conditioning,  a technique in which a bird was rewarded only when a correct selection was made; incorrect selections were not rewarded and prompted correction trials. Training with stained pathology slides included a large set of benign and cancerous samples from routine cases at UC Davis Medical Center. Some birds, for example, first learned to recognize benign or malignant samples in full color at low magnification (4X) and then progressed to medium (10X) and high (20X) magnifications. They also were tested using monochrome samples to eliminate color and brightness as potential cues, as well as samples with different levels of image compression, a procedure commonly used to reduce the size of digital data sets. To rule out the possibility that the birds were relying on rote memorization on the tests, brand-new samples were presented and food was dispensed regardless of whether the pigeons made a correct selection. And, indeed, the pigeons performed virtually as well on images that they had never been shown before, indicating that they had, in an extremely narrow sense, learned pathology.  The birds were remarkably adept at discriminating between benign and malignant breast cancer slides at all magnifications, a task that can perplex inexperienced human observers, who typically require considerable training to attain mastery,  Levenson said.  Pigeons  accuracy from day one of training at low magnification increased from 50 percent correct to nearly 85 percent correct at days 13 to 15.""  Wasserman, who has conducted studies on pigeons for over 40 years, found the pigeons especially adept at discerning pathology slides.  The pigeons learned to discriminate benign from cancerous slides as fast in this research as in any other study we ve conducted on pigeons in our laboratory,  Wasserman said.  In fact, when we showed a cohort of four birds a set of uncompressed images, an approach known as 'flock-sourcing,' the group s accuracy level reached an amazing 99 percent correct, higher than that achieved by any of the four individual birds.  Density on mammograms a challenge for pigeons For the mammogram study, the birds were trained to detect images with and without microcalcifications and to discriminate the presence of malignancy in breast masses using a similar process. Their accuracy averaged 84 percent for images with microcalcifications that they had been trained upon, and 72 percent for novel images   a level of performance on par with human radiologists and radiology residents who were given the same cases to review. The birds, however, had difficulty evaluating the malignant potential of breast masses (without microcalcifications) detected on mammograms, a task the authors acknowledge as  very challenging.  Human radiologists achieved an accuracy rate of about 80 percent when viewing images of the relatively subtle masses used in this study. But, the pigeons took many weeks   instead of days that they had needed to master the histopathology tasks   to learn to classify the breast masses in the mammogram training set. More strikingly, after the training phase, when they were finally shown novel, previously unseen images, the birds utterly failed to perform at a level better than chance.  The data suggest that the birds were just memorizing the masses in the training set, and never learned how to key in on stellate margins and other features of the lesions that can correlate with malignancy,  Levenson said.  But, as this task reflects the difficulty even humans have, it indicates how pigeons may be faithful mimics of the strengths and weaknesses of humans in viewing medical images.  Pigeons as human surrogates? After years of education and training, physicians can sometimes struggle with the interpretation of microscope slides and mammograms. Levenson, a pathologist who studies artificial intelligence for image analysis and other applications in biology and medicine, believes there is considerable room for enhancing the process.   While new technologies are constantly being designed to enhance image acquisition, processing, and display, these potential advances need to be validated using trained observers to monitor quality and reliability,  Levenson said.  This is a difficult, time-consuming, and expensive process that requires the recruitment of clinicians as subjects for these relatively mundane tasks.  Pigeons  sensitivity to diagnostically salient features in medical images suggest that they can provide reliable feedback on many variables at play in the production, manipulation, and viewing of these diagnostically crucial tools, and can assist researchers and engineers as they continue to innovate.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/a-cellular-symphony-responsible-for-autoimmune-disease-184970,A Cellular Symphony Responsible for Autoimmune Disease Broad Institute researchers have used a novel approach to increase our understanding of the immune system as a whole   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Broad core member Aviv Regev thinks about the immune system as if it were an orchestra:  Some instruments need to play strong, others need to pull back or push forward. It all has to form a harmony and this harmony changes with time,  she said.  Everything has to know its role and it has to be orchestrated   except you don t have a conductor.  Instead, each element of the immune system   the individual T cells and all of the proteins they interact with, for instance   is guided by the actions of every other element. (Regev conceded that,  in this way it s more like chamber music, maybe. ) In order to understand this system in detail, one must be able to tease out the unique characteristics of each cell. But until recently, investigative techniques only allowed for average analyses of groups of cells. That would be like trying to discuss Vivaldi s Four Seasons without being able to distinguish between the violins and the violas, said Regev, Director of the Klarman Cell Observatory (KCO) and a professor of biology at MIT. In collaboration with fellow senior scientists in the KCO Hongkun Park and, Vijay Kuchroo, the team used methods developed at the KCO to analyze individual Th17 cells. Normally, Th17 cells are found in the gut where they are critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis and gut barrier functions, but when found in tissues like brain or skin their immune function can go awry and they can induce autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Psoriasis. Getting this balance between necessary inflammation and unnecessary autoimmune pathologies right is important:  Imagine that you re infected with a virus: it comes in and you have to amplify your T cells and make them very active   they have to divide, they have to attack. But what if you don t know how to turn them off? You will become one big lymph node,  said Kuchroo, who is also Director of the Evergrande Center for Immunologic Diseases at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women s Hospital. That s because T cells (which make up the bulk of the lymph nodes) proliferate  like crazy,  so we need a way to turn things off.  The aggressive phenotype serves a physiological purpose,  said Kuchroo,  but in some people the ability to turn it off is lost and that increases the risk of developing a whole list of diseases: MS, IBD, Crohn's, et cetera.  Examining Th17 heterogeneity, one cell at a timeTo uncover what molecular circuits drive this pathogenic potential of Th17 cells, Broad postdoctoral scholar Jellert Gaublomme drove an effort to examine Th17 heterogeneity, one cell at a time. Gaublomme and his colleagues used microfluidic devices to trap and analyze individual Th17 cells taken from the central nervous system (CNS) or lymph nodes of a mouse model of MS. The Th17 cells the team observed spanned a spectrum of cellular states, ranging from cells from the lymph nodes with self-renewal properties to pathogenic cells (like memory and effector cells isolated from the CNS).  Importantly, the so-called  pathogenic  state of these cells is not necessarily pathological in our bodies,  said Nir Yosef, co-first author and computational lead of the project, who was formerly a postdoctoral scholar in both the Regev and Kuchroo labs and is now an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley.  It becomes a pathology when it happens at the wrong time or in the wrong place.   Because the cells isolated in vivo are at multiple stages of differentiation, we wondered if the pathogenicity differences we observed were merely a reflection of these different differentiation stages,  said Gaublomme, who was a graduate student in the Park lab during the research and is now a member of the Regev lab. In other words, they wanted to know whether there were fundamental differences between the cells they observed, or if they were just at different stages of a single trajectory. To answer that question, the team followed up with cells grown in culture in the laboratory, of which they could control the start of differentiation and harvest cells at a specific time point throughout the process. By looking at the RNA content of individual cells, the team was able to see which genes are expressed in each.  Th17 cells grown in culture revealed that pathogenicity is not just a function of differentiation duration, but is guided by regulatory mechanisms that differ from general Th17 differentiation,  Gaublomme said.  We found groups of genes that co-vary   that is they are either expressed together or tend to be mutually exclusive,  said Park, who is also a professor of chemistry and physics at Harvard University. One of these covarying groups, which consists of genes that are known to regulate pro-inflammatory behavior, were involved in the regulation of Th17 pathogenicity, either by driving it, or inversely, by dampening the pro-inflammatory response. This phenomenon allowed the team to tease apart the molecular differences that make some Th17 cells pathogenic and others protective.  That s not a really complicated concept,"" said Park, ""but we needed the right computational method to get there.  The co-variation groups included genes that had previously been associated with tissue inflammation as well as many novel genes.  We used another computational method to prioritize them and focused on four of the top ranking genes,  said co-first author Youjin Lee, formerly a research fellow in the Kuchroo lab and now a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California at San Francisco.  In the paper, we show how novel genes contribute to Th17 cell pathogenicity, and how the absence of some of these genes will make mice resistant to the mouse model equivalent of MS,  she said. Fat consumption may affect the activity of one novel geneOne of the genes the team identified, CD5L, became the subject of an entirely new study published alongside the initial paper. Led by first author Chao Wang, a postdoctoral scholar in the Kuchroo lab, the researchers pulled apart the biology of this one gene to understand the mechanism by which it can promote autoimmune disease. The results of the first study showed that CD5L is expressed in non-pathogenic cells but not in pathogenic ones, while this second study showed that the CD5L protein is a critical regulator for maintaining Th17 cells in the non-pathogenic state. It does this through a series of processes all associated with the lipid, or fat, composition of the cells. CD5L had never previously been associated with T cells, but it had been shown to affect lipid biosynthesis. This would have been difficult for immunologists and genomic scientists to follow up on, but for the Broad s Metabolite Profiling Platform it was a relatively straightforward task. The platform s director, Clary Clish, and his team analyzed the lipid signatures of normal cells and of cells in which the CD5L gene had been turned off. The authors found that the balance between two different lipid families   polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFA)   was altered in the cells without CD5L. That got Wang thinking.  Th17 cells have a master regulator called Ror t which was known to be controlled by some kind of lipid-like ligand,  she said.  But Ror t was an  orphan  nuclear receptor, and no one knew exactly what lipid controls it or how it does so.  When they  knocked out  CD5L, they found that the concentration of SFAs went up, while the concentration of PUFAs went down. This triggered the production of cholesterol, which had previously been revealed as a source of Ror t ligand. With more ligand around to bind it, Ror t gets turned on and initiates the synthesis of molecules associated with inflammation. The team also changed the lipid balance of normal cells with intact CD5L and observed the same effect   the cells went rogue and became more pathogenic. Likewise, if the researchers restored the normal lipid balance of CD5L-null mice, their normal function was restored. These findings were corroborated by previous research from other scientists, which showed that mice fed a PUFA-rich diet had reduced severity of colitis and less pathogenic Th17 responses. Taken together, the findings of this second paper show how CD5L is able to push or pull Th17 cells closer to or farther from a pathogenic state by modulating the fat balance inside the cell. As demonstrated in the first paper, CD5L is just one of several genes that work together and in concert with environmental factors to orchestrate a global immunological response to pathogens and can go awry, causing disease.  You can t ignore these things; they re all wired together to create this harmony,  Regev said. A single off-key violin may not have a major impact on the overall symphony   it will be drowned out by other violins.  But if you have a lot of these subtler changes, all of a sudden it s a cacophony,  she explained. The problem is much worse in the immune system, where all of the  violins  are talking to each other and changing their own behavior based on their neighbors  actions.  These observations may have a major impact in developing future therapies for human autoimmune diseases,  said Kuchroo.  For instance, we may be able to selectively inhibit pathogenic disease-inducing Th17 cells but spare the protective Th17 cells, like the ones that line the gut and maintain tissue barrier functions.

The approach combines several drugs and attacks the cancer on several fronts,  said Dr. Fred Saad, researcher at the University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre (CRCHUM) and principal investigator of the study. Antonio Paris, 59, is one of the patients participating in the CRCHUM.  Since I started the new treatment 14 months ago, my cancer first remitted and now is stable,  he said. With early detection, prostate cancer is treatable. The vast majority of men recover. But it's a different story for castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer. In this most advanced form of the disease, the cancer progresses despite treatment options which include radiation therapy, hormone administration, and even removal of the prostate or testicles. Few options are available to halt the cancer that has spread outside the prostate and is resistant to hormone treatment. Since 2011, abiraterone acetate, sold under the name Zytiga , has been administered orally in addition to standard hormone treatment. It blocks the production of testosterone, the male hormone, which acts as a fuel for cancerous tumours.  This treatment and other recent advances have extended the survival rates of men with the most advanced stages of prostate cancer while improving their quality of life. Life expectancy has increased from 18 months on average in 2004 to three years in 2015. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, researchers tested the safety of a preliminary combination treatment of abiraterone acetate and another drug not yet approved for market, JNJ-56021927. Antonio Paris participated in this initial research phase.  I take 14 pills a day, and it's going very well. I have the sweats and I'm tired a bit, but it doesn't stop me from doing all kinds of activities and even renovations,  he said.  Our trial conducted on forty patients indicate that this treatment is safe. The combined drugs are well tolerated and the treatment appears effective,  said Dr. Saad. Given these encouraging results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada authorized the start of a Phase 3 clinical study. The trial is designed to compare the efficacy of abiraterone acetate (1000 mg) and a placebo versus treatment combining abiraterone acetate (1000 mg) and JNJ-56021927 (240 mg). In both groups, patients also receive small doses of prednisone to help the treatment and reduce the side effects of abiraterone acetate. Dr. Saad co-directs this randomized, double-blind trial involving 960 patients worldwide. The findings of this international study will not be known for about another three years. The future treatment will therefore not be marketed for several years. But the researchers are enthusiastic. They hope this first combination treatment will successfully delay progression of the disease and prolong life. And above all, that it will improve the quality of life of patients with this devastating disease.","Published: November 30, 2015"

Brains with autism adapt differently during implicit learning Carnegie Mellon University scientists have discovered a crucial difference in the way learning occurs in the brains of adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Published in NeuroImage, Sarah Schipul and Marcel Just examined how the brains of typical and ASD individuals gradually became adapted to visual patterns they were learning, without awareness of the pattern, or implicit learning.   Vision test gives insight into the effect of prenatal exposure to recreational drugs Children exposed to marijuana in the womb show a significant improvement in their ability to track moving objects at age four, according to new vision research. But researchers are warning that the results do not mean marijuana has a beneficial effect on fetal development. The study from the University of Waterloo, University of Aukland and Brown University appears in the journal Scientific Reports.   An eagle-eye, real-time view of neural activity Every second of every day, the 100 billion neurons in your brain are capable of firing off a burst of electricity, an action potential, up to 100 times per second. For neurologists trying to study how this overwhelming amount of activity across an entire brain translates into specific thoughts and behaviors, the task can be well overwhelming. That s because existing techniques for monitoring neurons are too slow or have too narrow a scope to generate a holistic view. But in a new study, researchers reveal a technique for watching the brain s neurons in action with a temporal resolution of about 0.2 milliseconds a speed that is just fast enough to capture the action potentials in mammalian brains.    Connector hubs  are the champions of brain coordination A new University of California, Berkeley, study suggests the human brain's aptitude and versatility can be credited in large part to ""connector hubs,"" which filter and route information. They coordinate and integrate the flow of data so that brain networks dedicated to specific roles, such as vision and movement, can focus on their jobs. ""Our findings show that connector hubs allow for distinct networks to each do their own thing, yet still interact with each other effectively,"" said study lead author Maxwell Bertolero.   Drug-resistant epilepsy diet: Therapeutic mechanism uncovered Scientists from Royal Holloway, University of London and University College London have identified how a specific diet can be used to help treat patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The findings, which reveal how the ketogenic diet acts to block seizures in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, are published in the journal Brain.","Published: November 28, 2015"

Hobbs is the 2016 recipient of the prestigious Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences. The Breakthrough Prize, an international award begun in 2012 by Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and Alibaba founder Jack Ma, awards annual prizes of $3 million for discoveries in the fields of Mathematics, Physics, and Life Sciences. This year s Breakthrough Life Sciences Prize was presented to Dr. Hobbs, who is Director of the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development at UT Southwestern and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, in recognition of transformative genetics research techniques she developed and used to identify key genes involved in lipid metabolism and fatty liver disease.  Dr. Hobbs is an exceptional physician-scientist and a highly respected member of our faculty,  said Dr. Daniel K. Podolsky, President of UT Southwestern.  The Dallas Heart Study, which she pioneered and has led for the last 15 years, has proved to be a powerful resource for defining the genetic basis of human biology and disease, including mechanisms controlling cholesterol metabolism.  In 1999, Dr. Hobbs, Professor of Internal Medicine and Molecular Genetics at UT Southwestern, with funding from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation, co-launched the Dallas Heart Study, a multiethnic population-based study of several thousand individuals in Dallas County. The study collected extensive health information about the participants, in conjunction with obtaining multiple imaging studies as well as blood samples to determine levels of circulating lipids and proteins. Genomic DNA was isolated from the blood and extensive genetic profiling was performed.  We knew that genomics was coming, that we were going to be able to sequence everybody s genome. But what was going to be rate-limiting was being able to have a well-characterized population at our fingertips to be able to test our hypotheses. That s what the Dallas Heart Study provided us,  Dr. Hobbs said. The Dallas Heart Study provided a large database of individuals for whom researchers had both  genotype  (genetic sequence) and  phenotype  (actual physical traits) information. Dr. Hobbs then took an approach to using this data that was unique for the time. While other genetics researchers were focused on finding common differences in the genome that contribute to particular traits, Dr. Hobbs focused on rare genetic variants, believing that understanding these  exceptions  could more quickly lead to biomedical breakthroughs. After showing that rare genetic differences contribute to plasma HDL levels in the blood, Dr. Hobbs used the Dallas Heart Study to test a hypothesis regarding the function of a newly identified gene called PCSK9. It was known that certain mutations that changed the protein sequence of the PCSK9 gene led to very high levels of circulating LDL cholesterol, or bad cholesterol. Dr. Hobbs and colleague Dr. Jonathan Cohen, Professor of Internal Medicine and in the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development, hypothesized that mutations resulting in no PCSK9 being formed would lead to low levels of circulating LDL cholesterol. They then systematically sequenced study participants with the lowest LDL-cholesterol levels, looking for individuals with such PCSK9 mutations. By focusing on Dallas Heart Study participants whose LDL cholesterol levels were at the lowest end of the range, the researchers found two different mutations in the PCSK9 gene that resulted in a loss of function. One of every 50 African-Americans in the study had one of these mutations, and indeed had low LDL cholesterol. Subsequently, they showed that individuals with inactivating mutations in PCSK9 have a markedly reduced incidence of heart disease. The two geneticists  search didn t stop there. In 2006, Dr. Hobbs and Dr. Cohen announced that they had found a woman who had inherited not just one, but two mutations in the PCSK9 gene   one mutation from each parent. This woman, an aerobics instructor, had startlingly low levels of LDL cholesterol: Her LDL was 15 mg/dL, whereas anything below 100 mg/dL is considered optimal. Crucially, this woman suffered no ill effects from her extremely low LDL cholesterol, suggesting that therapies aimed at blocking or reducing PCSK9 would not only be effective but also safe. This work led to the development by drug companies of a stunningly effective class of drugs for lowering LDL cholesterol. The FDA approved the first two drugs in this new class of drugs this summer. After completing the PCSK9 work, Dr. Hobbs and Cohen used the Dallas Heart Study to look at the effects of mutations in another class of circulating proteins, the angiopoeitin-like proteins, which play an important role in determining how cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood are delivered to tissues. In this case, they sequenced the genes in the entire population and showed that mutations in several of the family members are associated with significantly lower levels of triglyceride, cholesterol or both lipids. Selected proteins from this family are now being pursued as drug targets for lipid lowering. When Dr. Hobbs and Dr. Cohen designed the Dallas Heart Study in 2000, they decided to begin to study another disease, fatty liver disease, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Fatty liver disease is a growing problem associated with the obesity epidemic. At the time they started, the prevalence of fatty liver disease was not known. The only study that had looked at fatty liver disease in a population had been one in Japan. In this study, sonography, a qualitative rather than quantitative assay, had been used to measure hepatic fat. Dr. Hobbs and Dr. Cohen, together with colleagues in radiology, used a recently developed method to measure hepatic fat very accurately. They found that one-third of the Dallas population had excess hepatic fat and that the three major ethnic groups in Dallas   blacks, whites, and Hispanics   had significant differences in the prevalence of fatty liver. Fatty liver disease was relatively uncommon among African-Americans, even among those who had high body fat, but was common among Hispanics. This suggested a genetic underpinning to the differences in liver fat content, and prompted them to begin looking for genetic sequence variations that might be associated with the condition. They have discovered that certain variants of the PNPLA3 gene and the TM6SF2 gene are both strongly associated with fat accumulation in the liver. Subsequently, it has been shown that the same sequence variations are also associated with liver inflammation, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Dr. Hobbs  rare-variant or low-variant approach is now emulated by researchers worldwide.  Through the application of the power of genetics, the Dallas Heart Study will undoubtedly continue to be an engine for discovery for decades to come,  added Dr. Podolsky, who holds the Philip O Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Presidential Chair in Academic Administration, and the Doris and Bryan Wildenthal Distinguished Chair in Medical Science. Selection Committees composed of previous Breakthrough Prize laureates select the subsequent winners. The Selection Committee for the 2016 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences is C.

The 2016 awards ceremony took place on Nov. 8. As part of the awards schedule, the recipients also take part in a series of lectures and discussions.  This is a wonderful honor,  said Dr. Hobbs, who holds the Eugene McDermott Distinguished Chair for the Study of Human Growth and Development, the Philip O Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Chair in Developmental Biology, and the 1995 Dallas Heart Ball Chair in Cardiology Research.  This prize recognizes the work I have done with Dr. Cohen, and the many terrific students and fellows in my laboratory,  she added. Dr. Cohen holds the C. Vincent Prothro Distinguished Chair in Human Nutrition Research.  I am grateful for the opportunity the Breakthrough Prize offers to influence a new generation of scientists. I also want to thank my colleagues and mentors for UT Southwestern s collaborative, intellectually stimulating environment. Special thanks go to Chairman Emeritus of Internal Medicine Dr. Donald Seldin, who single-handedly changed the course of my career by suggesting I try basic research, and Nobel Laureates Dr. Michael Brown and Dr. Joseph Goldstein, for the tough, rigorous yet supportive environment in which I trained as a scientist,  added Dr. Hobbs. Dr. Hobbs majored in human biology at Stanford University and earned her medical degree at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, then did her internship in internal medicine at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City. In 1980 she came to UT Southwestern where her husband, Dr. Dennis K. Stone, had graduated from medical school. Her leadership and clinical skills led to her being named chief resident in internal medicine at Parkland Memorial Hospital. She joined the faculty of UT Southwestern in 1987. Among Dr. Hobbs  many honors are her election to the National Academy of Sciences in 2007, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006, and the National Academy s Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) in 2004. Other honors include the American Heart Association s Clinical Research Prize, the Heinrich Wieland Prize, the American Heart Association Distinguished Scientist Award, the inaugural Prize in Atherosclerosis Research from the International Atherosclerosis Society, and the Pearl Meister Greengard Prize.","Published: November 28, 2015"

This is the first study to describe the results of surgically treated elderly patients with acute subdural hematomas. It is generally accepted that elderly patients who suffer from an acute subdural hematoma should not be treated surgically, as few survive and even fewer recover to an independent life. However, the world's population is rapidly aging leading to an increased rate of fall accidents. In the worst case, falling may result in brain hemorrhage. Age is one of the most significant outcome predictors in patients with traumatic brain injury. If the patient is young, an acute subdural hematoma is normally treated through a neurosurgical operation. However, even among young patients, mortality and significant morbidity are highly common, despite surgical treatment. In older patients, the success rate of the surgery are made worse by the fact that many patients are typically using oral anticoagulant medications to treat other cardiovascular diseases. The Neurosurgical Department in Helsinki University Hospital has been an exception in its policy to also treat elderly patients with acute subdural hematomas surgically. Researchers from the University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital have now determined how the patients' functional status before the injury and the use of oral anticoagulant medications influence the prognosis of patients 75 years or older operated on for an acute subdural hematoma. The study showed that no patients who had been brought to hospital unconscious, who had not been independent before the trauma, or who had used anticoagulants were alive at one year after the surgery. ""What was surprising, however, was that patients who were conscious at presentation, who were not using anticoagulants or were independent before the operation, recovered quite well. The expected lifespan of these patients was comparable to their age-matched peers,"" says MD, PhD Rahul Raj, one of the main authors. ""One should be careful to make to strong conclusions from such a small number of patients,"" Raj points out, ""but it seems that in approximately half of all cases, even elderly patients may benefit from surgery and recover to an independent life. It is important to note that included patients had an isolated acute subdural hematoma with no injuries to the brain tissue itself. This means that the results cannot be applied to patients with contusions or other intracranial injuries, whose treatment and prognosis are different."" According to Raj, the study throws new light on the old assumption that surgical treatment of the elderly is not a sensible course of action: ""The decision to treat through surgery should not be based on age alone, even though this is common."" Surgery of an acute subdural hematoma followed by intensive care and rehabilitation involve major costs and can cause significant suffering to patients and relatives. Thus, it is important to perform surgery on only the patients who are likely to benefit from it. ""But how do you define a bad prognosis? If only one in ten patients recovers sufficiently to live at home, is the treatment worthwhile? If half of the treated patients die within the year, is the treatment worthwhile? This is not a medical decision,"" the researchers emphasize. They believe that in the future, surgical treatment will be increasingly restricted to patients with the highest likelihood of recovering.

""One of the first signs of Alzheimer's disease is the loss of synapses,"" says study leader, Dr Vladimir Sytnyk, of the UNSW School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences. ""Synapses are required for all brain functions, and particularly for learning and forming memories. In Alzheimer's disease, this loss of synapses occurs very early on, when people still only have mild cognitive impairment, and long before the nerve cells themselves die. ""We have identified a new molecular mechanism which directly contributes to this synapse loss - a discovery we hope could eventually lead to earlier diagnosis of the disease and new treatments."" The team studied a protein in the brain called neural cell adhesion molecule 2, or NCAM2 - one of a family of molecules that physically connects the membranes of synapses and help stabilize these long lasting synaptic contacts between neurons. Using post-mortem brain tissue from people with and without the condition, they discovered that synaptic NCAM2 levels in the part of the brain known as the hippocampus were low in those with Alzheimer's disease. They also showed in mice studies and in the laboratory that NCAM2 was broken down by another protein called beta-amyloid, the main component of the plaques that build up in the brains of people with the disease. ""Our research shows the loss of synapses is linked to the loss of NCAM2 as a result of the toxic effects of beta-amyloid,"" says Dr Sytnyk.

Researchers have known for some time that long-term cannabis use increases the risk of psychosis, and recent evidence suggests that alterations in brain function and structure may be responsible for this greater vulnerability. However, this new research, published in Psychological Medicine, is the first to examine the effect of cannabis potency on brain structure. Exploring the impact of cannabis potency is particularly important since today's high potency 'skunk-like'products have been shown to contain higher proportions of  9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) than they did around a decade ago. In experimental studies THC has been shown to induce psychotic symptoms and 'skunk-like' products high in THC are now thought to be the most commonly used form of cannabis in the UK. Dr Paola Dazzan, Reader in Neurobiology of Psychosis from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King's College London, and senior researcher on the study, said: ""We found that frequent use of high potency cannabis significantly affects the structure of white matter fibers in the brain, whether you have psychosis or not. ""This reflects a sliding scale where the more cannabis you smoke and the higher the potency, the worse the damage will be."" Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, was used to examine white matter in the brains of 56 patients who had reported a first episode of psychosis at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM), as well as 43 healthy participants from the local community. The researchers specifically examined the corpus callosum, the largest white matter structure in the brain, which is responsible for communication between the left and right hemispheres. White matter consists of large bundles of nerve  axons, which connect different regions of the brain, enabling communication between them. The corpus callosum is particularly rich in cannabinoid receptors, on which the THC content of cannabis acts. The study found that frequent use of high potency cannabis was linked to significantly higher mean-diffusivity (MD), a marker of damage in white matter structure. Dr Tiago Reis Marques, a senior research fellow from the IoPPN at King's College London, said: ""This white matter damage was significantly greater among heavy users of high potency cannabis than in occasional or low potency users, and was also independent of the presence of a psychotic disorder."" Dr Dazzan added: ""There is an urgent need to educate health professionals, the public and policymakers about the risks involved with cannabis use. ""As we have suggested previously, when assessing cannabis use it is extremely important to gather information on how often and what type of cannabis is being used. These details can help quantify the risk of mental health problems and increase awareness on the type of damage these substances can do to the brain.""

While the standard CRISPR/Cas9 systems are great at making breaks in the genome with a single guide RNA in vitro, this technique is suboptimal for most gene therapy applications involving the editing of a large population of cells where minimizing collateral damage to the genome is critical,  said Scot Wolfe, PhD, associate professor of molecular, cell & cancer biology.  So we ve added an extra proofreading step to the system. By fusing a zinc finger DNA-binding domain to the CRISPR/Cas9 system, it now verifies an additional genetic feature in its intended target site before it will cut the genome. We ve shown that this dramatically improves the precision of the CRISPR/Cas9 system by almost 100 fold.  UMMS researchers are already developing this nuclease platform to excise latent HIV provirus from the genome of infected cells and potentially correct the genetic mutation that leads to chronic granulomatous disease, an inherited disease that renders the immune cells incapable of forming the reactive compounds necessary to kill certain bacterial and fungal pathogens.The CRISPR/Cas9 system is an adaptive immune system used by bacteria to defend itself against bacteriophage and other types of foreign genetic material. It consists of two components: a molecular scalpel Cas9 that cuts DNA efficiently but is muzzled in its native state and an RNA guide complex that unlocks the scalpel when a matching genetic sequence, defining the exact spot to cut, is found. These RNA guides are produced from clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats or CRISPR arrays, which contain remnants of the genomes of past viral infections. By arming the Cas9 nuclease to target and inactivate these viruses, the CRISPR/Cas9 system provides an adaptive immune defense for the bacterial cells. Scientists can reprogram the CRISPR/Cas9 system with artificial guide RNAs to cleave sequences within mammalian genomes and enable the surgical insertion of new fragments of genetic information into cells. A simple and efficient way of editing the genome, CRISPR/Cas9 is revolutionizing biomedical research by making it far easier to inactivate or activate genes in a cell line for study. It also simplifies creation of animal disease models that can be used to study human ailments. Work that used to take months or years to perform can now be done in weeks. Despite the power of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, it isn t perfect. There are times when the RNA guide used to maneuver the cleaving enzyme into the right position within the genome also targets the enzyme to other sequences that are similar but not identical. These mismatched sites, which can occur as many as 100 times across the 6 billion nucleotides that make up the human genome, can sometimes be cleaved, causing unintended damage.  Though not all of these 100 sites might cleave, if you re altering millions of cells, like you would in many potential clinical applications, chances are you ll have some with breaks and new insertions at places that weren t intended. This can result in local mutagenesis or genomic re-arrangements that could potentially cause problems, such as cancer,  said Dr. Wolfe. Zinc-finger domains are proteins that can be engineered to bind to specific regions of the genome. By combining the DNA-binding zinc-finger domains with the efficient cleaving mechanism and RNA guide of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, Wolfe and colleagues have created a new system that is both efficient and more accurate. In the current study, his team has shown that off-target cleavage events associated with the targeting of two different genomic locations dropped below detectable levels when CRISPR/Cas9 is combined with a zinc-finger DNA binding domain. At a third target site, the number of off-target cleavage events dropped by 10 fold.  What we have is like a GPS for CRISPR/Cas9,  said Wolfe.  By combing the DNA-binding domain with CRISPR/Cas9, we have created an exciting new technological platform that minimizes the potential risks for patients in need of gene therapy based treatments that could be addressed using artificial nucleases.

The acquisition of Biopta and its US subsidiary, Biopta Inc. is expected to complete on the 10th of December and is aimed at strengthening ReproCELL s pharmaceutical industry-targeted drug discovery services. The acquisition will also see an immediate investment to expand Biopta s range of contract research services. Biopta, which will continue to operate from its headquarters in Glasgow, aims to grow its workforce to 30 over the next three years and Biopta s management views the synergies within the ReproCELL Group of companies as key to its growth ambitions. Dr David Bunton, Biopta s co-founder and CEO said,  The acquisition by ReproCELL is a great opportunity to build on the solid platform we have in outsourced drug discovery services. Scotland is known for the quality of its scientists and customer service and ReproCELL s investment recognizes these strengths. We have had a close partnership with BioServe, another ReproCELL Group company, for the past five years, which has helped us establish a very successful US subsidiary. We see the acquisition as the natural next step in the growth of the UK and US businesses.  ReproCELL, a leader in the field of stem cells and regenerative medicine, was established in 2003 with the goal of contributing to people s health and welfare through the development of stem cell technologies. Many of ReproCELL s technologies were developed by the stem cell pioneers, Prof. Norio Nakatsuji from the Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences, Kyoto University, and Prof. Hiromitsu Nakauchi from The Institute of Medical Sciences, The University of Tokyo. ReproCELL s CEO, Dr Chikafumi Yokoyama said of the acquisition,  This will allow our company to increase our market share by expanding our lineup of drug discovery support products aimed at the pharmaceutical industry and accelerate the development of ReproCELL s new products and services.  Biopta was spun out of Glasgow Caledonian University in 2002 by its co-founders, Dr David Bunton, its CEO, and Professor Chris Hillier, with the aim of addressing the high failure rate of drugs during clinical trials through the use of ethically-sourced human tissues. The use of human tissues is considered more predictive of human responses to medicines than animal experiments and is part of a growing move by the pharmaceutical industry towards  non-animal alternatives . Moreover, the advent of  precision medicine , which aims to deliver the  right drug, at the right dose, to the right patient , necessitates the use of human tissue-based experiments of the type offered by Biopta, which reflect the diversity of the patient population. Biopta has developed a network of clinical partners in the UK and USA which provide human tissue samples for its research into diseases such as asthma, Crohn s disease and psoriasis. Biopta counts eight of the top ten pharmaceutical companies among its clients and has worked on over 500 potential new medicines. Biopta s Finance Director, Elaine Ferguson, says the cost savings for the pharmaceutical industry of improved drug selection are considerable,  the cost of each clinical failure has now become so high that most pharmaceutical companies are focusing on better preclinical selection of drugs, with a  fail fast, fail early  approach. Biopta s methods are just as valuable in identifying which drugs won t work in patients, as they are in identifying the next blockbuster drug . Biopta s management attributes close working partnerships with the NHS and Scottish Enterprise as key factors in its success. Biopta s Chairman, Dr Kevin Moore OBE said,  Scotland is probably the only place where a company such as Biopta could have evolved, due to the unique combination of angel investment from groups such as Braveheart and Tri Capital, the availability of skilled pharmacology graduates, collaboration with the NHS and co-investment support via Scottish Enterprise.  The deal will see ReproCELL acquire 100% of Biopta, which has received investment from Braveheart Investment Group, TriCapital, the Scottish Investment Bank, the investment arm of Scottish Enterprise and individual investors. Kerry Sharp, Head of the Scottish Investment Bank said,  We have provided investment support to Biopta over a number of years and it s heartening to see that this ambitious Scottish company with its world-leading capabilities has proven to be a compelling proposition for international investors.  The acquisition by ReproCELL will see Biopta continue its growth within a larger organization with clear synergies and complementary offerings, while retaining its base and employment in Scotland.

HLH causes the immune system to essentially overwhelm the body with inflammation that attacks vital organs, often leading to death. Study authors raise the possibility of screening children for HLH genes to identify those who may be at risk during a viral infection. ""Viruses that cause robust immune responses may be more likely to trigger rHLH in genetically susceptible people,"" said Randy Cron, MD, PhD, a senior investigator on the study and physician in Pediatric Rheumatology at UAB and Children's of Alabama. ""Prenatal screening for mutations in common HLH-associated genes may find as much as 10 percent of the general population who are at risk for HLH when an inflammation threshold is reached from H1N1 or other infectious triggers."" This study is the first to identify mutations of HLH-associated genes in H1N1 cases where patients had clinical symptoms of rHLH and a related condition called macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). An outbreak of H1N1 in 2009 turned into a global pandemic. H1N1 has since become part of the viral mix for the annual flu season and preventive vaccine, the authors note. Collaborating on the study were co-senior investigator Alexei Grom, MD, and first author Grant Schulert, MD, PhD, both physicians in the Division of Rheumatology at Cincinnati Children's. Cron and Grom have published articles linking clinical signs of rHLH to patients with hemorrhagic fever and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (an inflammatory condition in which the body thinks it has an infection and attacks vital organs and joints). The precise reasons these patients have clinical signs of rHLH have not been clear, although some juvenile arthritis patients who develop MAS also have HLH-linked gene mutations, according to the authors. There are two types of HLH, hereditary and the reactive form focused on in the current study. Both share common physical traits that involve the body's immune system overheating, excessive proliferation of immune cells call macrophages and severe inflammation. The only curative treatment at present is a bone marrow transplant, a risky procedure that is not always successful. ""There are no widely accepted and validated diagnostic criteria for reactive HLH, and criteria for familial HLH are not considered effective for rHLH or MAS,"" said Schulert. ""Regardless, it seems clear that a sizeable number of patients with fatal H1N1 infection develop rHLH. Our data suggest some people may have a genetic predisposition to develop severe H1N1 influenza, and critically ill H1N1 patients should be carefully evaluated for rHLH and MAS. The question is whether immunosuppressive therapy may benefit some patients with life-threatening influenza infection."" The current study examined the medical records of 16 adult patients, ages 23 to 61, who died between 2009 and 2014 while infected with H1N1. The patients and their HLH-like symptoms initially were identified through the Michigan Hospital Department of Pathology Database by study collaborator Paul Harms, MD, and his team at the Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School. Processed tissue samples from the patients were examined using whole exome genetic sequencing, which reads the entire genetic code of every gene in a person. Forty-four percent of the H1N1 cases met the clinical criteria for HLH and 81 percent for the related condition MAS. Five patients carried one of three different gene mutations in the commonly identified HLH gene LYST. Two of those five same patients also had a specific mutation in the gene PRF1, which decreases the function of immune system Natural Killer cells and aids the over proliferation of macrophage cells. Several patients in the study also carried variants of other genes linked to observed cases of MAS. The current study involved a small patient population in a single state and was retrospective in design (looking at records from past cases). The authors recommend conducting a larger prospective study to determine if genomic testing can predict the course of disease progression during influenza and other types of infections. Researchers also want to conduct further genomic and biological testing of children with juvenile arthritis to solidify potential links between gene mutations and secondary autoimmune disease.","Published: November 27, 2015"

In their study, published online Nov. 25 in Cell Stem Cell, Stowers Investigator Linheng Li, Ph.D., and first author Pengxu Qian, Ph.D., along with other collaborators, reveal how the mammalian imprinted Gtl2, located on mouse chromosome 12qF1, protects adult hematopoietic stem cells by restricting metabolic activity in the cells' mitochondria. The research focused on imprinted genes-genes ""stamped"" according to whether they are inherited from the mother or father. With imprinted genes, one working copy, or allele, is inherited instead of two. Either the copy from the mother or father is inactivated or ""silenced."" Typically, the paternally inherited allele's expression promotes growth, while the maternally inherited allele's expression suppresses it. The researchers found that when the Gtl2 locus is expressed from the maternally inherited allele, it produces non-coding RNAs to curb metabolic activity. Mechanistically, Gtl2's ""megacluster"" of microRNA, the largest cluster of microRNA in the mammalian genome, suppresses the mTOR signaling pathway and downstream mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism, thus blocking mitochondrial-associated byproducts called reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can damage adult stem cells. ""Reactive oxygen species are like the potentially harmful byproducts that come from industrial manufacturing,"" says Li. ""ROS are unavoidable derivatives of the mitochondrial metabolic process and need to be managed by the cell,"" he explains. Hematopoietic stems cells renew themselves and differentiate into other cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, constantly renewing the body's blood supply in a process called hematopoiesis. Because of their extraordinary transformative qualities, the transplantation or transfusion of isolated human hematopoietic stem cells has been used in the treatment of anemia, immune deficiencies, and other diseases, including cancer. While hematopoietic stem cells have gained attention in research, it remains largely unknown how cell metabolic states are controlled. The new findings shed light on the delicate metabolic control required to balance hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and action and the associated healthy hematopoiesis. An upset in that balance can cause cells to grow abnormally and lead to disease. Abnormalities in the Gtl2 locus on human chromosome 14q32.2 are associated with uniparental disomy in which an individual receives two copies of a chromosome from one parent and no copy from the other parent. Uniparental disomy may cause delayed development, mental retardation, or other medical problems. Differences in gene expression at the Gtl2 locus have also been linked to fetal alcohol exposure disorder. But when working properly, the Gtl2 locus acts as a great protector of cells. ""Most of the non-coding RNAs at the Gtl2 locus have been documented to function as tumor suppressors to maintain normal cell function,"" Qian says. Li's team zeroed in on Gtl2 by studying hematopoietic stem cells in mice with support from Stowers core centers including cytometry, bioinformatics, histology and electron microscopy, molecular biology, and tissue culture. Other collaborators included researchers from the University of Kansas; the University of Kansas Medical Center; Tianjin Medical University, China; Christian Medical College, Vellore, India; Tokyo University of Agriculture, Japan; and University of Cambridge, United Kingdom. Over the three-year study, investigators used transcriptome profiling to analyze 17 hematopoietic cell types and found that non-coding RNAs expressed from the Gtl2 locus are predominantly located in a subset of the cell types, including adult ""long-term"" hematopoietic stem cells which have long-term self-renewal capacity. In subsequent experiments, deleting the locus from the maternally inherited allele in hematopoietic stem cells increased mitochondrial biogenesis and subsequent metabolic activity as well as increased ROS levels, with the latter inducing cell death. The finding opens the possibility for Gtl2 to be used as a biomarker because it could help label dormant (or reserve) stem cells in normal or potentially cancerous stem cell populations, Li says. The addition of a fluorescent tag to the Gtl2 locus could allow researchers to mark other adult stem cells in the gut, hair follicle, muscle, and neural systems.","Published: November 27, 2015"

Scientists at Cornell University's Baker Institute for Animal Health have developed a device that helps diagnose stroke in less than ten minutes using a drop of blood barely big enough to moisten your fingertip. Having demonstrated proof of principle, the technology could eventually be expanded and used in point-of-care testing devices to diagnose other conditions in humans and animals, including traumatic brain injury (concussion), some forms of dementia, and even some types of cancer and heart disease. The study's lead author, author Roy Cohen, a Research Scientist at the Baker Institute, says the technology represents the successful pairing of two big goals in medical diagnostics small size and simplicity a combination that means testing could be carried out at a patient's bedside. ""Three quarters of stroke patients suffer from ischemic stroke a blockage of a blood vessel in the brain. In those cases, time is of the essence, because there is a good drug available, but for a successful outcome it has to be given within three or four hours after the onset of symptoms,"" says Cohen. ""By the time someone identifies the symptoms, gets to the hospital, and sits in the emergency room you don't have much time to obtain the full benefit of this drug."" Enhancing the speed of diagnosis could save many people from suffering lasting effects of ischemic stroke, he says. To diagnose stroke, a condition in which blood flow to an area of the brain is limited or cut off, the technology will one day detect several blood-borne biomarkers, molecules that appear in the blood when the stroke occurs. The technology uses enzymes attached to nanoparticles to detect the biomarker molecules and convert that detection into light. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach, the researchers focused on the biomarker neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a substance found in higher concentrations in the blood of victims of stroke and other conditions. By measuring the amount of light produced from various samples, Cohen and his colleagues can determine the concentration of NSE in the sample. At each step of the way, the signal from the NSE is amplified, so even minute quantities give off enough light for detection. The idea to tether the enzymes, says co-author Alex Travis, Associate Professor of Reproductive Biology at the Baker Institute for Animal Health, came from the hardworking enzymes tethered to the shafts of sperm tails. These sperm enzymes efficiently turn sugars into energy that powers the flagellum and moves the sperm along. The fact that they're attached to the sperm tail instead of floating around in solution enables the enzymes to efficiently pass the substrate along from point to point and get the most ""bang for the buck"" from a sugar molecule, according to Travis. Going forward, Travis and his team will collaborate with a private company to develop the stroke-detecting technique for clinical testing and eventually make it available for use in hospitals. But he's also excited to expand the system to diagnose other conditions. ""This system could be tailored to detect multiple biomarkers,"" says Travis. ""That's the strength of the technique. You could assemble a microfluidic card based on this technology that could detect ten biomarkers in different wells, and the readout would be the same for each one: light."" Using the same detection system for multiple different biomarkers would make for a simple system in a relatively small package, he says. For now, Cohen says, they're experimenting with using the system to detect traumatic brain injury among mixed martial arts athletes. The early results of this work have been promising, he says, and he hopes to report on them soon. Cornell University, College of Veterinary MedicineCohen R et al.

The study is published in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. Many cases have occurred in the United States in people who acquired the virus while traveling, but the first locally transmitted case in the US occurred in Florida in July 2015. The study showed that the rate of brain infection, or encephalitis, from the chikungunya virus is higher than the rate seen in the United States due to West Nile virus and similar infections between 1999 and 2007. Outbreaks of chikungunya have occurred in numerous areas, including Africa, Asia, the Caribbean islands, and as of September 2015 more than 7,000 cases have been reported in Mexico, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most common symptoms of the infection are fever and joint pain. Most people recover within a week. For some people, the joint pain can continue for months and even years.  Since there is no vaccine to prevent chikungunya and no medicine to treat it, people who are traveling to these areas should be aware of this infection and take steps to avoid mosquito bites, such as wearing repellent and long-sleeves and pants if possible,  said study author Patrick G rardin, MD, PhD, of Central University Hospital in Saint Pierre, Reunion Island. The epidemic of the virus on Reunion Island occurred in 2005 to 2006 and affected 300,000 people. For the study, researchers looked at whether people with neurological symptoms at disease onset were still affected three years later. A total of 24 people had encephalitis that was associated with chikungunya virus, for a cumulative incidence rate of 8.6 per 100,000 people. Encephalitis was more likely to occur in infants and people over age 65. The incidence rate in infants was 187 per 100,000 people; it was 37 per 100,000 people in people over age 65.  These numbers are both much higher than the rates of encephalitis in the United States in these age categories, even when you add together all the causes of encephalitis,  G rardin said. The death rate for those with chikungunya virus-associated encephalitis was 17 percent. An estimated 30 to 45 percent of the infected persons with encephalitis had persisting disabilities. The disabilities included behavioral changes and problems with thinking and memory skills in infants and post-infectious dementia in previously healthy adults.

The study addresses decades of conflicting opinions and evidence about the medications' effect on sleep. In what's known as a ""meta-analysis,"" researchers from the UNL Department of Psychology combined and analyzed the results from past studies of how ADHD medications affect sleep. In the study published online by the journal Pediatrics, the Nebraska researchers found children given the medicines take significantly longer to fall asleep, have poorer quality sleep, and sleep for shorter periods. ""We would recommend that pediatricians frequently monitor children with ADHD who are prescribed stimulants for potential adverse effects on sleep,"" said Katie Kidwell, a psychology doctoral student who served as the study's lead author. Psychology doctoral student and lead author Katie Kidwell (right), doctoral student Alyssa Lundahl and Professor Tim Nelson authored the paper along with doctoral student Tori Van Dyk (absent). Credit: Craig Chandler UNL Communications  About 1 in 14 children and adolescents in the US are diagnosed with ADHD, a chronic condition that includes attention difficulty, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. In the most common form of ADHD treatment, about 3.5 million are prescribed stimulant medications such as Ritalin and Adderall. Many research articles have been written in the past 30 years on whether ADHD medications harm the ability to sleep. Some researchers have found that the drugs do interfere with sleep, particularly if taken later in the day. Others maintain the medications improve patients with ADHD's ability to sleep, by relieving symptoms and reducing resistance to bedtime. Indeed, some suggest that sleep problems are caused by the medication wearing off near bedtime, creating withdrawal symptoms. ""One reason we did the study is that researchers have hypothesized different effects, and there are some conflicting findings in the literature,"" said Timothy Nelson, an associate professor of psychology involved in the study. ""This is when a meta-analysis is most useful. By aggregating and previous research in a rigorous and statistical way, we can identify the main findings that we see across all these studies. It's essentially a study of studies."" After screening nearly 10,000 articles, Kidwell and her colleagues reviewed 167 full texts before selecting nine studies of sufficient rigor for their analysis. Tori Van Dyk and Alyssa Lundahl, also psychology doctoral students, assisted in the effort. Studies chosen for the analysis were peer-reviewed, randomized experiments. The studies did not rely on parental reports of their children's sleeping patterns, instead requiring objective measures obtained through clinical sleep studies or wristband monitors used at home. The researchers found that both methylphenidate medications like Ritalin and amphetamines like Adderall cause sleep problems, without identifying differences between the two. Although they were unable to determine whether varying dosage amounts changed the effect on sleep, they found that more frequent dosages made it harder for children to fall asleep. They found that drugs tend to cause more sleep problems for boys. The problems dissipate, but never completely go away, the longer children continue to take the medication. ""Sleep impairment is related to many cognitive, emotional and behavioral consequences, such as inattention, irritability and defiance,"" Kidwell said. ""Sleep adverse effects could undermine the benefits of stimulant medications in some cases. Pediatricians should carefully consider dosage amounts, standard versus extended release, and dosage frequencies to minimize sleep problems while effectively treating ADHD symptoms."" She also recommended considering behavioral treatments, such as parental training and changes to classroom procedures and homework assignments, to reduce ADHD's negative consequences. ""We're not saying don't use stimulant medications to treat ADHD,"" Nelson said. ""They are well tolerated in general and there is evidence for their effectiveness. But physicians need to weigh the pros and cons in any medication decision, and considering the potential for disrupted sleep should be part of that cost-benefit analysis with stimulants.""

Through experiments conducted in rats exposed to cocaine, the researchers mapped out the network of circuits that cause wild firing of neurons that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter that regulates movement and emotion. The findings also help explain how cocaine use eventually leads to desensitization. The researchers used tracer molecules to follow electrical activity in the brain in rats exposed to cocaine. They found that a hub of neurons in the extended amygdala (the brain's motivation/learning center) acts as a relay between activation of the ventral subiculum (the brain's addiction center) and the hyperactive release of dopamine. Over time, increasing activation of a key part of the extended amygdala--the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis produces a long-lasting increase in signal transmission onto neurons that produce dopamine so that the rats became desensitized to the cocaine. Since this change happens within the amygdala, it may explain some of the long-term effects on behavior and motivation that occur after prolonged cocaine use. ""Unraveling the neuronal circuit and characterizing the synaptic mechanisms by which the ventral subiculum alters the excitability of dopamine neurons is a necessary first step in understanding the resulting behavioral changes induced by cocaine,"" says senior author Fran ois Georges of Bordeaux University in France. ""We show that the ventral subiculum recruits the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis to drive a persistent hyperactivity of dopamine neurons and control cocaine-induced activity."" Surprisingly, a single stimulation of the ventral subiculum (which lasts about 10 minutes in an anesthetized rat) had the same impact on the brain and dopamine neurons as a massive injection of cocaine. These effects lasted up to five days and raise the possibility that dopamine-producing neurons can be changed so that they respond differently to stimuli. In addition to providing insights on the circuits involved in drug addiction, the findings might be helpful for understanding and even changing the perception of natural rewards; for example, those related to food or exercise, which the authors plan to pursue next.

Suddenly a dog runs out in front of you. What are your chances of seeing it before it's too late? Even with 20/20 vision in broad daylight on a clear day, our peripheral vision can be surprisingly poor, particularly when the scene in front of us is cluttered. Now, scientists at the University of Cambridge, UK, Northeastern University, Boston, USA, and Queensland Brain Institute, Brisbane, Australia, believe they are a step closer to understanding why this is. ""When objects in our peripheral vision are surrounded by visual clutter, a phenomenon known as 'visual crowding' hinders our ability to make sense of what we see,"" explains Will Harrison from the University of Cambridge. ""Visual crowding is ubiquitous in natural scenes and affects virtually all everyday tasks, including reading, driving and interacting with the environment. But this failure of vision isn't a problem with our eyes it represents a processing limit of the brain."" In a study published in the journal Current Biology, Harrison and Peter Bex from Northeastern University have shed new light on how constraints in the brain limit our peripheral vision. The researchers showed volunteers a series of images with differing levels of visual crowding. To make sure they kept their eyes still, the volunteers were asked to focus on a dot. Beside the dot was a broken ring, like the letter 'C', but with the gap positioned at a random orientation. The volunteers were asked to estimate the angle at which the gap appeared by freely rotating a second C so that it matched the target as closely as possible. This helped the researchers to measure each individual's uncrowded perceptual acuity. Image: Focus on the green spot. Without moving your eyes, you should be able to identify the letter  A  on the left side of the display; the same letter is almost impossible to see on the right side of the display. Courtesy: University of Cambridge  To measure crowded perception in the next stage, the C was surrounded by an additional, larger C a 'distractor' at different orientations and/or distances to the target C. The volunteers again rotated a second C until they thought it matched the target. Whereas previous studies looking at crowding had only given binary results was the observer right or wrong? this new method enabled the researchers to quantify crowding as a continuous experience. The researchers found that when the angle of the target and distractor were similar, observers tended to choose an average of the two orientations. When the target and distractor angles were quite different, observers tended to choose either the correct orientation (that of the target) or they mistakenly reported the orientation of the distractor. However, this effect depended on the target and distractor being positioned very closely together reports were not influenced by a distractor positioned a large distance away from the target. Combining the findings with a computational model of how visual neurons represent the visual field, Dr Harrison and Professor Bex found that problems in identifying objects in our peripheral vision are due primarily to a combination of two factors. First, in a crowded scene, our visual resolution is degraded, meaning that we become less precise at locating an object's detail. Second, we confuse which detail belongs to which object, to the extent that part of one object can appear 'swapped' with a part of a different object. Importantly, their model suggests that both factors are caused by the same underlying brain mechanism. Dr Harrison believes the findings may have implications for quantifying and treating vision disorders, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A large portion of the elderly population suffers from AMD, which causes debilitating central blindness. The loss of high-resolution central vision forces AMD sufferers to rely solely on peripheral vision, which is very poor due to visual crowding. ""We hope that in future it may be possible to adapt our methods to quantify the degree to which patients with AMD are visually-impaired,"" explains Dr Harrison. ""At the moment, it can be difficult to quantify the extent or severity of their visual deficits. Our method would allow a careful examination of the function of AMD patients' remaining vision, which could in turn lead to better rehabilitation techniques down the track.""

But if there is a glitch in the connection between train and track, diseases can occur. In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Tatyana Polenova, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and her team at the University of Delaware (UD), together with John C. Williams, associate professor at the Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope in Duarte, California, reveal for the first time atom by atom the structure of one of these proteins bound to a microtubule. The protein of focus, CAP-Gly, short for ""cytoskeleton-associated protein-glycine-rich domains,"" is a component of dynactin, which binds with the motor protein dynein to move cargoes of essential proteins along the microtubule tracks. Mutations in CAP-Gly have been linked to such neurological diseases and disorders as Perry syndrome and distal spinal bulbar muscular dystrophy. The research team used magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UD to unveil the structure of the CAP-Gly protein assembled on polymerized microtubules. The CAP-Gly protein has 1,329 atoms, and each tubulin dimer, which is a building block for microtubules, has nearly 14,000 atoms. ""This is the first time anyone has been able to get an atomic-resolution structure of any microtubule-associated protein assembled on polymerized microtubules,"" Polenova says. ""With magic-angle-spinning NMR, we can look into the structure of this and other assemblies of microtubules and their associated proteins and gain critical insights into their function and dynamics, as well as begin to gather clues as to how mutations cause disease."" In this technique, a sample is placed in the NMR's small, tube-like rotor, which is then spun inside the NMR magnet at an angle of 54.74 degrees called the ""magic angle"" because it suppresses the atoms from interacting magnetically. The result is a high-resolution protein fingerprint, a graph of hundreds of peaks representing the frequencies of two or more interacting atoms. These data are then used to calculate the 3-D structures. The 3-D structures of CAP-Gly, which show the spatial arrangement of atoms in the protein molecule, are different between the free state of the protein and its bound state to the microtubule. These structures reveal how the protein interacts with microtubules, predominantly through its loop regions, which adopt specific conformations upon binding. However, static structures of CAP-Gly do not tell the whole story about the protein. ""Just as we are always moving our arms and legs about, proteins are very dynamic. They do not stand still,"" Polenova says. ""These motions are essential to their biological function, and NMR spectroscopy is the only technique that can record such movements, with atomic resolution, on a variety of time scales, from picoseconds to arbitrarily long time scales seconds, days, weeks to help us understand the protein's function. We know from our prior studies that CAP-Gly is dynamic on timescales from nano- to milliseconds, and this mobility is essential for the protein's ability to interact with microtubules and with multiple other binding partners."" The research, which has been ongoing since 2008 when the first data sets were collected, required the development of new protocols for preparing the samples, new NMR experiments to gather various information on structure and dynamics, and new protocols for data analysis. In the future, Polenova and her team envision using NMR in combination with cryo-electron microscopy, in which samples are studied at extremely low temperatures, typically below 200 degrees Fahrenheit, to look at even more complex systems in a highly preserved form.

CFS, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), is a condition that causes persistent exhaustion that affects everyday life and doesn't go away with sleep or rest. Diagnosis of the condition is difficult as its symptoms are similar to other illnesses. A research team from the University of Leicester led by Dr Claire Hutchinson from the Department of Neuroscience, Psychology and Behaviour has examined patients with and without CFS and has found that those suffering from the condition are more vulnerable to pattern-related visual stress, which causes discomfort and exhaustion when viewing repetitive striped patterns, such as when reading text. The results of the study, which is published in the journal Perception, could help in the diagnosis of CFS, as the findings suggest that there are visual system abnormalities in people with ME/CFS that may represent an identifiable and easily measurable behavioral marker of the condition. Hutchinson explained: Diagnosis of ME/CFS is controversial. With the exception of disabling fatigue, there are few definitive clinical features of the condition and its core symptoms, overlap with those often prevalent in other conditions. As a result, ME/CFS is often a diagnosis of exclusion, being made as a last resort and possibly after a patient has experienced a series of inappropriate treatments of misdiagnosed disorders.  It is imperative therefore that research focuses on identifying significant clinical features of CFS/ME with a view to elucidating its underlying pathology and delineating it from other illnesses. Doing so will help researchers and healthcare professionals gain important insights into the condition, aid diagnosis and, in the longer term, inform evidence-based therapeutic interventions.  The study assessed vulnerability of ME/CFS patients to pattern-related visual stress using a standardized test called the pattern glare test, in which people report the number of visual distortions they experience when looking at three repetitive striped patterns of different levels of detail. During the study twenty patients with CFS and twenty patients without the condition were recruited. Participants viewed 3 patterns, the spatial frequencies (SF) of which were either 0.3 (low-SF), 2.3 (mid-SF) and 9.4 (high-SF) cycles per degree (c/deg). They then reported the number of distortions they experienced when viewing each pattern. Patients with ME/CFS reported more distortions on the intermediate striped pattern (Pattern 2) than people without the condition. Hutchinson added:  The existence of pattern-related visual stress in ME/CFS may represent an identifiable and easily measurable behavioural marker of ME. This could, in conjunction with other diagnostic tests, help delineate it from other conditions.  Dr Neil Abbot, Research & Operations Director at ME Research UK, added: ""Around three-quarters of people with ME/CFS report a range of eye and vision-related symptoms that interfere with their everyday lives, yet there has been very little scientific investigation of the problem.  Dr Claire Hutchinson and her team have previously confirmed the existence of eye movement difficulties in ME/CFS patients, and that symptoms, including eye pain, can be severe. Her new report in Perception extends these findings and raises the possibility that vision anomalies, including pattern-related visual stress, may have a diagnostic role in the disease.""

Researchers at Johns Hopkins report they have figured out the molecular chain of events that enables the cells to make ""sounds"" on their own, essentially ""practicing"" their ability to process sounds in the world around them. The researchers, who describe their experiments in the journal Cell, show how hair cells in the inner ear can be activated in the absence of sound. ""The multistep process we uncovered reminds me of a Rube Goldberg invention,"" says Dwight Bergles, PhD, professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, a reference to Goldberg's construction of complicated gadgets to perform seemingly simple tasks. ""Cells in the inner ear exploit a system used for fluid secretion in other organs to simulate the effect of sound before hearing begins, preparing them for the real deal."" Normal hearing in most mammals, Bergles says, is a multistep process that begins with sound waves hitting the ear drum, which transfers energy to the air-filled middle ear and its three tiny bones. Then the fluid in the inner ear vibrates at a corresponding electrical frequency, which bends the ""antennas"" of just the right ""hair cells,"" causing them to release chemical messengers that tell nearby nerves to fire. That signal then travels to the brain, where it is interpreted as a particular sound. Scientists, Bergles says, already knew that hair cells and nearby ""supporting"" cells in the developing inner ear show synchronous bursts of activity that are triggered by release of the ""energy"" chemical ATP, which is also used as a potent communication signal. This activity is then conveyed to the brain in the same way that sound-evoked information is, leading to burst firing of neurons in different auditory centers of the brain. What was unknown was how ATP activates hair cells. To find out, Bergles and his team homed in on biochemical elements of the system and found that chloride ion channels in the supporting cells seemed crucial. They knew that ATP triggers a rise in calcium levels inside supporting cells, so they guessed that the calcium was the cue for a calcium-activated chloride channel to open.Cross section of sensory epithelium of developing inner ear in a mouse.

Bergles  An analysis of gene activity in the supporting cells pointed to involvement of the TMEM16A chloride channel, and they found high levels of this channel within supporting cells that surround inner hair cells. Experiments in mice revealed that when this channel was removed from supporting cells or blocked with drugs, the spontaneous excitation of the hair cells decreased. Further biochemical tests, combined with electrical recordings and imaging of calcium changes in the inner ears of mice, allowed the team to piece together a full chain of events. First, supporting cells release ATP, leading to self-stimulation of their own ATP receptors, triggering an increase in calcium levels inside the cells. This rise in calcium opens the TMEM16A channels to let chloride out, which also drags potassium ions and water out. The potassium that is released during these events activates the hair cells, stimulating the nerve cells with which they have formed weak connections. It's this pairing, says Bergles, that is thought to stabilize connections that help the brain make sense of sounds. ""This step happens during the first two weeks after birth in mice and rats, when the middle ear is still filled with fluid and outside sounds can't reach the inner ear."" He adds: ""The hair cells are arranged in a line and respond to different frequencies based on their location, like keys on a piano. Their connection with nearby nerve cells is strengthened every time a hair cell is activated and causes its partner nerve cell to fire."" When the brain receives a signal from hair cells near the entrance of the inner ear, he says, it ""hears"" a high-pitched sound; when the signal comes from farther in, it ""hears"" a deeper sound. ""There's a beauty to this seemingly overly complex process,"" Bergles says. ""It uses the capabilities of the cells in a novel way to trigger nerve cell activity. We think this helps establish and refine the connections between ear and brain so that the animals can properly hear sounds as soon as they are exposed to them."" Because mice can't tell researchers if they are hearing anything, researchers can only surmise that they do based on activity they record in the auditory centers of the brain. Bergles says their research suggests that these ""sounds"" might be perceived as single tones played in succession, something like tests of an emergency response system. He says that the self-made sounds are for the ear what a batting machine is for a baseball player. ""The machines don't have all the richness and unpredictability of a pitcher throwing a ball, but they nevertheless help players prepare for the big event."" Although this self-stimulation process disappears after hearing begins, Bergles says that if this pathway were reactivated following injury, it could lead to tinnitus, or ""ringing"" in the ear. Further understanding of this early signaling, he says, may lead to new strategies for improving the integration and performance of cochlear implants and speeding recovery from sound-induced trauma.

For decades, medical schools have taught doctors that the best way to treat cancer and metastatic progression is to memorize a list of tumors and their typical migration patterns. Metastasis is the development of malignant tumor growths elsewhere from the primary site of cancer.  This is akin to back in the days when weather reporting depended solely on a barometer and experience,  said Jorge Nieva, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC and co-author of the new study.  Medical students are taught very fundamental cancer progression patterns. What the modeling does is it brings the sort of complexity of modern-day weather forecasting to trying to understand where tumors go, when they go and how they get to that location. This type of mathematical modeling is wholeheartedly different from what most medical students learn today.  The study looked at 25 years of data regarding 446 breast cancer patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. It focused on a subgroup of women who were diagnosed with localized disease but later relapsed with metastatic disease. The model shows that cancer metastasis is neither random nor unpredictable. Survival depends significantly on the location of the first metastatic site or  spatiotemporal patterns.  In other words, USC researchers uncovered a framework to explain how tumor cells circulate through a patient s bloodstream over time to settle in various organs. The path that varies depends on tumor makeup and treatment decisions.  There s nothing like this in the cancer world; there s nothing really like this in the disease progression community even though the techniques are well-developed in other contexts,  said Paul Newton, lead author of the study and an aerospace and mechanical engineering professor at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering.  Our long-term goal is to build comprehensive predictive computational simulations of metastatic cancer. Ultimately what we want to do is tailor those models to individual patients using their individual characteristics.  The concept The framework USC researchers built combines scattered data points doctors are already collecting in order to produce an understandable, comprehensive cancer map. The system design is comparable to information Google collects to predict Web-surfing patterns and to determine PageRank.  If somebody is reading about breast cancer on Wikipedia, the likelihood that she is going to jump to a lung cancer page or a bone cancer page is much higher than the likelihood of her jumping to the Costco website,  said Newton, who is also a professor at the Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Keck School of Medicine of USC as well as professor of mathematics.  These probabilities of jumping from one page to another are not all equal. Where you jump to next depends strongly on where you currently are. This observation lies at the heart of our model.  Chances of survival Breast cancer patients die when tumors have colonized an average of four metastatic sites, the study found. Women had the poorest chances of long-term survival if they had more than two initial metastatic locations; they fared much better if migrating tumor cells first landed on one organ. Roughly 35 percent of breast cancer patients developed first metastasis to the bone, while less than 5 percent contracted their first metastasis in the brain, Newton said. The five-year survival of the bone group is more than 90 percent, whereas the brain group had survival characteristics of 20 percent or less, he said. Peter Kuhn, senior author of the study, explained further.  If you have breast cancer with metastasis to the bone and your next metastasis is the liver, you are likely to die from that,  said Kuhn, Dean s Professor of Biological Sciences and professor of medicine, biomedical engineering, and aerospace and mechanical engineering at the USC College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.  If you have breast cancer with metastasis to the bone and the next metastasis is in the lung, you are unlikely to die from that. Instead, the disease is going to spread further first.  Expanding the cancer treatment team The study s results led the researchers to further define the words  spreaders  and  sponges  to describe metastasis, a nomenclature that eventually could inform medical teams how best to deliver personalized therapy plans.  A spreader is a site that is likely the source of new disease,  Kuhn said.  Hence you need to avoid spreaders or eliminate the disease if it shows up at a spreader site. At a sponge site, one might just manage or stabilize. Of course if you could eliminate all of it, you would. But if you have multiple metastasis, one would attempt to stabilize the sponge but eliminate the spreader.  Bone, chest wall and mammary lymph nodes were spreader sites in the patients sampled. Lungs, distant lymph nodes and liver were sponge sites. The future of cancer care could be squads consisting of a biologist, a mathematician, a physicist and a computer programmer to complement the current medical teams, Newton said. USC is working on a convergent science initiative that provides a collaborative environment for cancer experts. Construction of the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience broke ground in October 2014. It will eventually be the largest building on campus.  Over the next five to 10 years, there s going to be a big change in the way medical schools and oncologists think about disease,  Newton said.  I could easily see a situation 10 years down the road where a patient comes in with a particularly difficult disease. The oncologists in charge will put together a team of researchers to develop a model to forecast disease progression and determine best treatment options that they would then implement.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center contributed their clinical expertise and supplied the data set used in this study.

The study resulted from a collaborative research effort that included scientists from UC Davis, UCLA and the University of Washington. The research team hopes to apply the breakthrough approach to bioengineering problems in food, health and biofuels. ""We can skip the traditional steps and jump really quickly to the enzyme of interest,"" said senior author Justin Siegel, a UC Davis assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry. The researchers filed for a patent claim on the study results   a small set of residues that clearly correlate with a targeted protein function. Residues are another term for amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. The residues identified in the study increase production of E. coli bacteria.New technique strengthens protein patent process ""It's a completely new way of filing a patent for protein,"" Siegel said. Patenting residues instead of entire proteins could minimize challenges from competitors, Siegel said. ""Our approach offers better protection. ""If the residues are present in any protein in this context, then we own it,"" Siegel said. ""If you can really patent a protein well, it makes it much easier for companies to get something of value with a single patent."" Enzymes are the backbone of biology's chemical factories. These protein molecules speed up biological chemical reactions and are used to manufacture everything from medicine to biofuels. The specialized enzyme industry is worth millions of dollars, with the market estimated to hit nearly $1 billion by 2020, according to Allied Market Research. New enzyme discovered Siegel and his research colleagues discovered an enzyme that changes a key step in an E. coli metabolic pathway, which makes short-chain alcohols such as ethanol. Previous research by project collaborators at UCLA revealed that tweaking a single enzyme, called KIVD, can shift the output toward long-chain alcohols. To find a replacement for KIVD, the UC Davis-led team used computational tools and molecular modeling to identify potential proteins listed in genome databases. The best candidate from their search was surprisingly different from the KIVD protein, Siegel said. The two proteins shared only 15 percent of the same amino acid sequences. This is unusual because most enzyme engineering   and patents   target proteins that are 80 to 90 percent similar to the original, he said. When lead author Wilson Mak, a UC Davis chemistry graduate student, swapped out KIVD for the new enzyme, called GEO 175, production of long-chain alcohols increased tenfold, the researchers reported. More than 95 percent of the total product consisted of long-chain alcohols such as octanol. However, even though the protein swap pumped up long-chain alcohol production, the bacteria's overall output dropped. That's because the long-chain alcohols were toxic to the microbes, destroying their cell walls, Siegel said. Alternative production methods such as continuous extraction could solve the toxicity problem, or engineering the cells to better withstand the chemicals. Comparing new and old techniques The researchers also tested their new approach against a more traditional enzyme engineering technique. With this technique, the team mutated the activity of a well-known enzyme to get the desired function. This required two successive rounds of screening more than 400 mutants to find a good match. ""We had to make thousands of genes to do mutagenesis, and it took a lot more time, money and effort than genomic mining,"" Siegel said. ""Our new methods will hopefully translate into better, cheaper, more sustainable catalysts and chemicals.""","Published: November 26, 2015"

The study raises an interesting theory: since gut microbes depend on us for a place to live, it is to their advantage for populations to remain stable. It would make sense, then, if they had a way to communicate to the host when they're not full, promoting host to ingest nutrients again. In the laboratory, Fetissov and colleagues found that after 20 minutes of consuming nutrients and expanding numbers, E. coli bacteria from the gut produce different kinds of proteins than they did before their feeding. The 20 minute mark seemed to coincide with the amount of time it takes for a person to begin feeling full or tired after a meal. Excited over this discovery, the researcher began to profile the bacterial proteins pre- and post-feeding. They saw that injection of small doses of the bacterial proteins produced after feeding reduced food intake in both hungry and free-fed rats and mice. Further analysis revealed that ""full"" bacterial proteins stimulated the release of peptide YY, a hormone associated with satiety, while ""hungry"" bacterial hormones did not. The opposite was true for glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone known to simulate insulin release. The investigators next developed an assay that could detect the presence of one of the ""full"" bacterial proteins, called ClpB in animal blood. Although blood levels of the protein in mice and rats detected 20 minutes after meal consumption did not change, it correlated with ClpB DNA production in the gut, suggesting that it may link gut bacterial composition with the host control of appetite. The researchers also found that ClpB increased firing of neurons that reduce appetite. The role of other E.coli proteins in hunger and satiation, as well as how proteins from other species of bacteria may contribute, is still unknown. ""We now think bacteria physiologically participate in appetite regulation immediately after nutrient provision by multiplying and stimulating the release of satiety hormones from the gut,"" Fetisov says. ""In addition, we believe gut microbiota produce proteins that can be present in the blood longer term and modulate pathways in the brain.""","Published: November 26, 2015"

""It has always been assumed that fat-storing cells are produced only from stem cells that live and self-renew in fat tissue,"" said the study's senior author Dwight Klemm, PhD, professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. ""But our paper, along with one recently published by our colleagues in Sweden, shows for the first time fat cells produced by stem cells that originate in the bone marrow inside human fat tissue."" The study found that a significant number of fat cells are generated from bone marrow stem cells. That's important, Klemm said, because previous studies in mice have shown that these cells produce substances called cytokines, which promote inflammation and hinder the ability of other cells to respond to insulin, increasing the risk for diabetes. ""Our study suggests that it may be the type of fat-storing cell produced in our bodies that determines risk for disease, rather than the amount of fat,"" said Klemm, an expert on obesity and pulmonary hypertension. ""This discovery highlights the possibility of new strategies to prevent and reverse fat-related chronic diseases by controlling the production of different types of fat-storing cells."" The study was done using people who had received a bone marrow transplant from another donor. A small sample of their fat tissue was removed from just under the skin. The DNA from those fat cells was evaluated to determine if it came from the person who donated the bone marrow or the recipient. ""We detected the presence of donor DNA, which indicated that some of the fat cells had grown from cells that originated in the transplanted bone marrow,"" said Kathleen Gavin, PhD, postdoctoral fellow and lead author on the study. If researchers can show that these cells are linked to chronic diseases, they may be able to genetically modify and ultimately block their production, part of CU Anschutz's commitment to taking advances in research from the laboratory to the clinic. Klemm believes it's possible to prevent or reverse fat-related chronic disease by controlling the type of fat-storing cells produced in the body. ""Even more exciting is the possibility of combining bone marrow or stem cell transplant technology with genetic engineering to tailor-make fat-storing cells with specific desirable functions,"" he said, stressing the importance of collaborative research in bringing the best new treatments to patients.

The work reveals physiological circuits as a new kind of epigenetics   information existing outside of genomic sequence   that determines large-scale anatomy.   The finding that head shape is not hard-wired by the genome but can be overridden by manipulating electrical synapses in the body suggests that differences in species could be determined in part by the activity of bioelectrical networks. The discovery could help improve understanding of birth defects and regeneration by revealing a new pathway for controlling complex pattern formation. It has long been known that neural networks exploit bioelectric synapses to store and re-write information in the brain.  It is commonly thought that the sequence and structure of chromatin   material that makes up chromosomes   determine the shape of an organism, but these results show that the function of physiological networks can override the species-specific default anatomy,  says the paper s senior and corresponding author Michael Levin, Ph.D., who holds the Vannevar Bush Chair in biology and directs the Center for Regenerative and Developmental Biology in the School of Arts and Sciences at Tufts.  By modulating the connectivity of cells via electrical synapses, we were able to derive head morphology and brain patterning belonging to a completely different species from an animal with a normal genome.  Knowing how shape is determined and how to influence it is important because biologists could use that knowledge, for example, to fix birth defects or cause new biological structures to grow after an injury, adds Levin.  These findings raise significant questions about how genes and bioelectric networks interact to build complex body structures,  he says. Working with Girardia dorotocephala   free-living planarian flatworms, which have remarkable regenerative capacity   researchers were able to induce the development of different species-specific head shapes by interrupting gap junctions, which are protein channels that enable cells to communicate with each other by passing electrical signals back and forth.  The changes were more than skin deep; they included not only the overall shape of the head but also the shape of the brain and the distribution of the worm s adult stem cells. The ease with which a particular shape could be coaxed from a G. dorotocephala worm was proportional to the proximity of the target worm on the evolutionary timeline. The closer the two species were related, the easier it was to effect the change. This observation strengthens the connection to evolutionary history, suggesting that modulation of physiological circuits may be one more tool exploited by evolution to alter animal body plans. However, unlike the Levin lab s previous work, in which a different species of planaria could be permanently altered to a two-headed morphology, this shape change was only temporary. Weeks after the planaria completed regeneration to the other species  head shapes, the worms once again began remodeling and re-acquired their original head morphology. Additional research is needed to determine how this occurs. The authors also presented a computational model that explains how changes in cell-to-cell communication can give rise to the diverse shape types. First author on the paper was Tufts undergraduate Maya Emmons-Bell, a senior majoring in biology.  We've demonstrated that the electrical connections between cells provide important information for species-specific patterning of the head during regeneration in planarian flatworms,  she says.  This kind of information will be crucial for advances in regenerative medicine, as well as a better understanding of evolutionary biology. As an undergraduate, it s been an extraordinary experience to conduct and author important research with leading biologists.  The interdisciplinary research involved U.S.- and Canada-based biologists and European mathematicians.","Published: November 26, 2015"

A growing interest in the therapeutic value of animal venom has led a pair of Columbia University data scientists to create the first catalog of known animal toxins and their physiological effects on humans. VenomKB, short for Venom Knowledge Base, summarizes the results of 5,117 studies in the medical literature describing the use of venom toxins as painkillers and as treatments for diseases like cancer, diabetes, obesity, and heart failure. Drawn from an automated analysis of the literature, VenomKB documents nearly 42,723 effects on the body. Though modern medicine makes use of only a small fraction of the toxins documented thus far, the researchers hope that the catalog will spur the discovery of new compounds and medical treatments.  With this list we can take stock of what we know about venoms and their therapeutic effects  said Nicholas Tatonetti, an assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Columbia University Medical Center and a member of the Data Science Institute.  The questions now is: How can we use this information with other databases to discover new compounds and therapies? Tatonetti and Joseph Romano, a graduate student, searched on the term  venoms/therapeutic use  in a database of 22 million medical research papers. This produced a list of 5,117 venom-related studies whose results they summarized using a pair of computer algorithms. After cross-referencing toxins and drugs listed under multiple names and correcting other irregularities in the data, they found 42,723 unique mentions of venoms having a specific effect on the body.  Venom s capacity to heal is paradoxically linked to its fast-acting, lethal effects in the wild. Found in more than 173,000 species, venoms evolved over millions of years to target molecules that are often involved in disease. The toxic proteins and amino acids known as peptides that make up venom act on cell receptors and ion channels, controlling how cells behave. By mimicking or altering how these toxins act on specific human cells, researchers can develop drugs that inhibit pain or treat diseases, often with fewer side effects than those of drugs already on the market. About a dozen major drugs have emerged from this strategy so far, National Geographic magazine reported in 2013. One of the first, an anticoagulant called Arvin, gained favor in the late 1960s after a doctor discovered that ancrod, a protein found in the venom of the Malayan pit viper, could treat blood clots in the legs. The widely used type 2 diabetes drug Byetta, is made from the toxin exenatide, found in the saliva of the venomous Gila monster, a lizard native to the United States and Mexico. Another drug, bombesin, uses a toxin found in the skin of the venomous European fire-bellied toad to treat gastrointestinal disorders. Bombesin s ability to bind to neuronal tumors has led to interest in developing a florescent version that could guide surgeons around the edges of a tumor. Five compounds produced by the venomous cone snail have made it to clinical trials, including ziconotide, the generic term for an analgesic similar to morphine. The Malayan pit viper, Gila monster, European fire-bellied toad, and cone snail account for about 18 percent of the 5,117 venom-related studies now catalogued in Venom KB. Yet there are 10 million or more venomous species that have yet to be studied. Zoltan Takacs, a toxinologist who earned his PhD in evolutionary studies at Columbia, estimates there are 20 million venom toxins waiting to be screened. Venom KB got its start after Romano approached Tatonetti, his thesis adviser, about studying medicinal uses of venom. Tatonetti suggested that Romano start looking through the venom database. To their surprise there was neither a database nor a list. Still modest in size, VenomKB is expected to grow more useful as researchers contribute more data.  With a large enough library we can screen for more effective, safer compounds,  said Romano. Databases of compounds and their biological effects have been used in recent years to discover and develop new drugs as well as uncover problems with drugs already in use. Tatonetti and his colleagues mined a federal database of documented drug side effects, the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), and discovered that the interaction of the anti-depressant paroxetine, sold under the brand name Paxil, and the statin pravastatin, sold as Pravachol, could raise blood glucose levels in diabetic patients. With VenomKB up and running, Tatonetti and Romano plan to contribute data of their own. Starting with samples of dried venom from the black mamba, they will perform experiments and explore new treatments for chronic pain, diabetes and heart disease.","Published: November 26, 2015"

The program supports projects that study how large-scale environmental events such as habitat destruction or pollution alter risks of viral, parasitic and bacterial disease emergence.  The Kansas State University team will study data for vector-borne infectious diseases to model how these types of epidemics spread. Vector-borne diseases are spread by infectious microbes transmitted by ticks, mosquitos or other insects or parasites. Kansas State University researchers are particularly interested in the role of long-distance dispersal in the spread of diseases. They will evaluate the efficacy of different control methods, such as limiting animal movements or reducing the vector population. As models are compared and refined, they will help researchers develop rules of thumb for controlling outbreaks. Scoglio, professor of electrical and computer engineering, said the project combines scientists with expertise in plant pathology, livestock diseases and vector-borne diseases to identify similarities in how the different types of diseases spread.  ""We come from different disease modeling frameworks, but the point is to see if these frameworks can be translated   if there are unifying aspects in any spreading process,"" Scoglio said.  ""The role of long-range dispersal is important to examine because sometimes the diseases don't spread as a wave in a population, but they jump to far locations because an infected animal is transferred to a distant farm or an exposed person travels from one city to another, maybe on a different continent,"" she said.

The new study also points to a potential treatment, an experimental antibiotic that appears to inhibit infection by these deadly viruses, all of which lack vaccines and treatments. The study was led by TSRI Associate Professor Hyeryun Choe.  Most of these viruses use a specific molecule to enter cells,  Choe said.  In the new study, we were able to show how a second molecule plays a major and previously unknown role in that process. We also show an antibiotic called duramycin inhibits the actions of this molecule. This looks to be a promising broad-spectrum antiviral strategy and deepens our understanding of the entire infection process.  Emerging Health Concern The viruses in question belong to several families, including the flavivirus and filovirus families. Flaviviruses like dengue and West Nile viruses cause tens of thousands of deaths each year. Filoviruses like Ebola have emerged as major health concerns, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas such as the recent highly publicized Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Perhaps the greatest concern is dengue virus. More than one third of the world s population is estimated to be at risk for dengue and more than 100 million people are estimated to be infected annually, according to recent studies. The viruses take advantage of the process that normally occurs during programmed cell death or apoptosis. During this process, a lipid usually found on the inner side of the cell membranes, specifically phosphatidylserine (PS), shifts to the surface. Apoptosing cells are then recognized by PS receptors on phagocytes cells that devour invading pathogens and dying cells and engulfed by them. When cells are dying from a virus infection, their freshly exposed PS is grabbed by the exiting virus and phagocytes engulf the virus. Once engulfed, the virus quickly turns the cell's own biology on its head, forcing it to produce copies of the virus. New Insights In the new study, Choe and her colleagues showed how another lipid known as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which is present on the viral surface, also contributes to the viral entry process.  Despite the name, we found that PS receptors also detect PE, and viruses are able to take advantage of the abundance of PE on their surface,  said Audrey St phanie Richard, the first author of the study and a research associate in the Choe lab.  Through their PE, they latch onto the PS receptors on the host cell, taking control of the process and insuring entry and replication.  Duramycin blocks viral entry into the cells by binding to the virus s PE, preventing the virus from using it to latch onto the PS receptors on the cell. Duramycin, which is currently used as an imaging agent, binds specifically to PE. Disrupting the relationship between these two molecules could open the door to new and novel antiviral strategies, potentially including duramycin and similar PE-inhibitors.  This new study goes a long way in helping us understand how so-called PS receptors contribute to flavivirus and filovirus infections and how we can block them through the PE-binding compounds,  Choe said. The study also shows that PE is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells and promotes their uptake by phagocytes.","Published: November 26, 2015"

Breast cancer patients whose tumors lack the RNA molecules have poorer survival rates than their peers. The RNA molecules directly associate with and inhibit a well-known, cancer-associated protein called KRAS, the researchers found. In their absence, KRAS becomes hyperactive and issues continued signals to the cell to divide.  This is the first time an RNA molecule in this class has been shown to act as a powerful tumor suppressor,  said Paul Khavari, MD, PhD, professor and chair of dermatology at Stanford.  It does so by inhibiting the function of one of the most powerful cancer-causing proteins in the cell.  Khavari is the senior author of the study and the lead author is Zurab Siprashvilli, PhD, a senior scientist at Stanford. An oncogene is a gene that, when mutated, can cause cancer. The mutated gene creates a malfunctioning protein that encourages a cell to divide uncontrollably or enables it to sidestep the normal breakpoints that would halt cell division or launch a cellular suicide program to protect the organism. The KRAS protein is a product of an oncogene. The protein sits on a cell s outer membrane and functions as an on-off switch to control cell division. Normally, it helps cells respond appropriately to external signals calling for cell growth. When mutated, however, it encourages the cell to undergo repeated rounds of cell division. KRAS mutation is an essential step in the development of nearly all human cancers. Deadly deletions The RNAs studied by the researchers are small, noncoding RNAs known as snoRNAs. Unlike the more familiar messenger RNA molecules that carry protein-making instructions from the DNA in the nucleus to the outer cellular machinery called ribosomes, noncoding RNAs fulfill other necessary cellular functions. SnoRNAs are known to help assemble the ribosomes themselves, for example. Siprashvilli and his colleagues were interested in learning what role snoRNAs might play in the development of human cancers. To do so, they compared 5,473 tumor genomes with the genomes obtained from surrounding normal tissue in 21 different types of cancer. In many ways, cancer cells represent biology s wild west. These cells divide rampantly in the absence of normal biological checkpoints, and, as a result, they mutate or even lose genes at much higher rate than normal. As errors accumulate in the genome, things go ever more haywire. The researchers found that a pair of snoRNAs called SNORD50A/B had been deleted in 10 to 40 percent of tumors in 12 common human cancers, including skin, breast, ovarian, liver and lung. They also noted that breast cancer patients whose tumors had deleted SNORD50A/B, and skin cancer patients whose tumors made lower levels of the RNAs than normal tissue, were less likely than other similar patients to survive their disease.    We were searching for areas of the genome that are highly abnormal in cancer cells,  said Khavari, who is the Carl J. Herzog Professor of Dermatology.  We were very surprised to find SNORD50A/B so frequently deleted in so many different kinds of cancer. They are deleted as often as other very well-known tumor suppressor genes.  Because snoRNAs are best known for their role as housekeepers, it was surprising to find SNORD50A/B so directly implicated in human cancer. Khavari and his colleagues investigated to see if the RNAs were associated with any particular proteins in the cancer cells.  Stunningly, we found that these RNAs associate with proteins in the RAS family, and specifically KRAS,  Khavari said.  This is really last thing we would have expected. It was particularly surprising because my lab has been studying KRAS intensively for more than a decade, so it was quite a coincidence.  Goading cancer cells to divide Siprashvilli set out to find out more about the interaction between KRAS and SNORD50A/B. He found that when he deleted SNORD50A/B in human melanoma and lung cancer cells grown in the lab, the cells divided more quickly and displayed more cancerous traits than when SNORD50A/B was present. Finally, they showed that when SNORD50A/B binds to KRAS, it inhibits the protein s ability to associate with an activating molecule called farnesyltransferase. Farnesyltransferase modifies the KRAS protein in such a way to allow it to travel to the cell s membrane to await external signals for growth and division.  Normally, SNORD50A/B and farnesyltransferase work together to balance KRAS  function and allow it to respond appropriately to external signals,  Khavari said.  When SNORD50A/B are missing, the balance is tilted toward KRAS hyperactivation.  In other words, when the genes for SNORD50A/B are lost from the genome, KRAS is free to goad the tumor cells to undergo repeated rounds of cell division.

When the virus destroys so many immune cells that the body can t fight off infection, AIDS will develop. The disease took the lives of more than a million people last year.  For the past three and a half years, a team of researchers from six universities, led by the University of Delaware and funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, has been working to uncover new information about a protein that regulates HIV s capability to hijack a cell and start replicating. Their findings point to a new avenue for developing potential strategies to thwart the virus. The team included scientists from UD, the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Carnegie Mellon University, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Florida State University and Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. They used a combination of high-tech tools and techniques, including magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and computer simulations of molecules, to examine the interactions between HIV and the host-cell protein cyclophilin A (CypA), right down to the movement of individual atoms.   In a nutshell, we found that the infectivity of HIV is regulated by the motions of these proteins,  says Tatyana Polenova, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Delaware, who led the study.  It s a subtle regulation strategy that does not involve major structural changes in the virus.  Sixty times smaller than a red blood cell, HIV contains a cone-shaped shell, or capsid, made of protein, which surrounds two strands of RNA and the enzymes the virus needs for replication. Like any virus, HIV can only produce copies of itself once it has invaded a host organism. Then it will begin directing certain host cells to begin producing the virus.  But how does HIV invade a cell? In humans, the protein CypA can either promote or inhibit viral infection through interactions with the HIV capsid, although the exact mechanism is not yet known. A portion of the HIV capsid protein, called the CypA loop, is responsible for binding to the CypA in the human host cell. Once this occurs, the virus typically becomes infectious.  However, a change of just one amino acid in the CypA loop can cause the virus to operate opposite from how it does normally, allowing the virus to become non-infectious when CypA is present, and to become infectious when there is no CypA present. Such changes are called  escape mutations,  Polenova says, because they allow the virus to  escape  from its dependence on CypA.  To home in on this escape mechanism, the research team examined assemblies of different variants of HIV capsid protein complexed with CypA. Using magic-angle-spinning NMR, they recorded the motions in these assemblies, atom by atom, on time scales ranging from nanoseconds to milliseconds, from a billionth of a second to a thousandth of a second.  The team found that a reduction in the naturally occurring motions in the binding region due to the mutations allowed the virus to escape from CypA dependence. Magic-angle-spinning NMR experiments provided a direct probe of these motions, recording the changes in the magnetic interactions between nuclei. Computer simulations allowed the team to visualize the motions.  Some portions of the capsid protein do not move at all or move only a little while other portions undergo large-amplitude motions distributed over a wide range of time scales, with the most dynamic region being the CypA loop. Polenova says it is rather surprising that such extensive motions are present in the assembled capsid, and that these dynamics could be detected by both NMR and computer simulations.  It is the first time that quantitative agreement between experiment and computation was achieved in a dynamics study, and it s particularly exciting that this was attained for such a complex system,  Polenova says.  We hope this work may guide the development of new therapeutic interventions, such as small molecules that would serve as interactors with the HIV capsid and inhibit these dynamics.  Polenova says the diverse team of researchers, with expertise in HIV virology, structural biology, biophysics and biochemistry, was critical to the study s success, along with access to national high-field NMR facilities through the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The team was assembled through the NIH-funded Pittsburgh Center for HIV Protein Interactions. Led by Prof. Angela Gronenborn, the center brings together high-caliber scientists and facilities to elucidate the interactions of HIV proteins with host cell factors.

The team of interdisciplinary scientists encompassing the biomedical, neuro, and nanosciences, all of whom are based at Trinity College Dublin, adopted a  neutral territory  approach by comparing the effects of these two forms of a non-disease-related protein. They made their comparisons in cells and animal models, and via experiments that studied electrical  brainwave  responses in these cells. They showed that both forms killed cells and impacted on potential memory processes in a similar way to specific proteins such as beta amyloid (Alzheimer s), alpha-synuclein (Parkinson s), huntingtin (Huntington s) and prions (Creutzfeld Jakob)   despite the protein aggregates coming from a non-harmful hen egg protein called lysozyme. Associate Professor in Biochemistry at Trinity, Dr Kenneth Hun Mok, led the study. Dr Mok said:  It is really surprising that both forms of the protein aggregates operated in a similar way to the neurodegenerative-disease-related proteins. Their toxic effects, which included cell death, came about via different mechanisms, but the big news here is that the mere presence of these protein aggregates seems to endow them with the properties that are so damaging to brain cells   it is a surprise that a non-harmful protein like lysozyme can have such an effect.   In addition, we have shown that   rather than one or the other   both the oligomeric and mature fibril forms are clearly toxic, providing an answer to a topic that had been debated for many years."" ""Scientists all across the world, including many here at Trinity, are tirelessly working to develop drug candidates that will prevent such protein aggregation from occurring. It is hoped that preventing or reversing this process will turn the tide in the fight against these debilitating neurodegenerative diseases.  Along with several young researchers including N al Harte and Igor Klyubin, Dr Mok collaborated with Professor of Neuropharmacology, Michael J Rowan, Professor in Chemistry, Principal Investigator in CRANN and Dean of Research, John Boland, and Associate Professor in Neuroscience, Gavin Davey, to complete the research.","Published: November 26, 2015"

UQ Australian Infectious Diseases Research Centre s Dr Jody Hobson-Peters said the discovery could pave the way to stopping outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease.  Viruses are typically viewed as harmful,  she said.  Rarely do we consider that some viruses may hold the key to fighting back against human disease. The presence of Parramatta River virus or other similar  good  viruses in a mosquito may make it harder for the human disease-causing  bad  viruses to also infect that mosquito, thus stopping disease transmission. ""This discovery highlights how little we know about mosquitoes and their relationships with pathogens. ""By learning about mosquito-borne viruses we may be better able to predict outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease.  University of Sydney medical entomologist Dr Cameron Webb said the saltmarsh mosquito (Aedes vigilax), which is responsible for spreading Ross River virus, was one of the most common pest mosquitoes in coastal regions of Australia, including Sydney and Brisbane.  It probably bites more people than any other mosquito,  he said. ""With this discovery, we could find a way to vaccinate mosquitoes and stop their bites making thousands of Australians sick every summer."" Queensland and New South Wales recorded a big outbreak of Ross River virus, with this year thousands of people falling ill. Parramatta River virus was discovered in saltmarsh mosquitos collected just west of the Sydney CBD in 2007, and its presence was again confirmed last year and this year in Brisbane. Dr Hobson-Peters and colleagues, including UQ PhD student Breeanna McLean, developed and implemented a new system to rapidly screen thousands of mosquitoes for the new virus.   It s incredibly exciting that we detected Parramatta River virus using our new virus discovery system,  Ms McLean said.  Never before have we been able to assess mosquito populations for novel viruses so easily.  The virus was isolated, cultured and described from a  soup  of mosquitoes collected in the wetlands along the Parramatta River. The research was supported by Australian Research Council Discovery Project funding, an Australian Postgraduate Award and the UK Medical Research Council.  It involved team members at UQ s School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, School of Biological Sciences, Queensland Health, the University of Western Australia and the University of Glasgow.","Published: November 26, 2015"

The open-label trial, conducted in collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, will examine BL-8040 s ability to improve bone marrow cellularity and peripheral blood counts in up to 25 patients suffering from these bone marrow failure conditions. The study s primary endpoint is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of treatment with BL-8040 on top of the standard immunosuppressive regimen of Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (hATG), Cyclosporine and Methylprednisolone (steroids) in hMDS and AA patients. Secondary endpoints include assessment of the clinical efficacy (response rate), time and duration of response to the treatment, and overall survival following treatment. Safety and efficacy will be assessed at defined time points throughout the study. Duration of response and overall survival will also be assessed as part of the study s long term follow up protocol. Study patients will initially receive BL-8040 as a monotherapy for ten days. From Day 11 through Day 14, patients will receive hATG, Methylprednisolone and Cyclosporine. Subsequently, during the first month of treatment, from Day 15 until Day 30, patients will continue treatment only with Methylprednisolone and Cyclosporine. Beginning in the second month, patients will continue daily treatments with Cyclosporine through the end of the sixth month, which is the end of the study treatment. In addition, beginning in the second month, BL-8040 will be administered daily as part of the maintenance period for the first 5 days of each month, also until the end of the six-month study period. Both hMDS and AA are characterized by a T cell-driven autoimmune attack on the bone marrow that results in depletion of hematopoietic precursors, leading to anemia and low white blood cell counts. In this regard, high CXCR4 expression on pathogenic T cells has been suggested to facilitate infiltration to the bone marrow. BL-8040, a CXCR4 antagonist, is expected to inhibit migration of pathogenic T cells to the bone marrow, thereby mitigating the severe depletion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. In addition, BL-8040 may directly affect the number of hematopoietic precursors. Preclinical studies in mice showed that multiple doses of BL-8040 led to a marked increase in the number of hematopoietic progenitor cells and hematopoietic stem cells in both the bone marrow and peripheral blood. BL-8040 also promoted production of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, leading to a prolonged increased platelet production. These direct effects of BL-8040, along with the exclusion of the pathogenic T cells from the bone marrow, may improve bone marrow cellularity and peripheral blood counts. Dr. Kinneret Savitsky, CEO of BioLineRx, stated,  We are very pleased to commence an additional clinical trial for BL-8040, our unique oncology platform, in these two orphan designations that represent significant unmet medical needs. This study expands our existing successful collaboration with the MD Anderson Cancer Center, where we are already running a Phase 2 trial in relapsed/refractory AML. The hMDS/AA trial will assess BL-8040 in combination with standard of care immunosuppressive therapy, with interim results expected by the end of 2016. We are very hopeful that BL-8040, as part of a novel treatment regimen, will significantly improve bone marrow cellularity and peripheral blood counts in patients suffering from these difficult bone marrow failure conditions.

With many pharmaceutical companies moving toward targeted therapies instead of  one-size-fits-all  drugs, a practical method for matching cancer patients with specific drug candidates is needed to enable the evolution to precision medicine. NGS enables testing of multiple genes simultaneously from a single sample to help identify their unique genetic profile. This information can then be used to guide the appropriate therapy choice among multiple drug candidates. The streamlined and personalized methodology defined in the development agreement between the companies has the potential to improve safety, effectiveness and health outcome of patients via targeted risk stratification and tailored treatment approaches. The collaboration, focused on a universal testing approach, could also accelerate the development and registration of several new NSCLC drugs and drug indications, with the ultimate goal of providing patients greater access to more targeted treatments and appropriate clinical trials as quickly as possible.  We look forward to this collaboration and the future potential of this technology to further enhance the ability to connect patients to the right clinical trials and treatments for them, even those patients with less common tumor mutation types,  said Alessandro Riva, MD, global head oncology development and medical affairs, Novartis Oncology.  It is our hope that we will be able to take advantage of this new technology as part of our growing lung cancer portfolio to offer even better outcomes for patients.   We believe that this collaboration will help us get closer to our goal of ensuring that cancer patients are able to benefit from a targeted therapy associated with their tumor s genetic profile,  said Hakan Sakul, Ph.D., executive director and head of diagnostics, worldwide R&D, Pfizer.  The Thermo Fisher Scientific NGS panel is aligned with a number of our clinical development programs, providing us with an opportunity to accelerate the development for each of these potential new therapies for NSCLC patients with targetable genetic alterations.  The NGS-based companion diagnostic test for NSCLC will be developed using Thermo Fisher s Ion PGM Dx System and Oncomine assays. Both the NGS platform and Oncomine reagents leverage the Ion AmpliSeq technology, which enables simultaneous sequencing of hundreds of genes, with high reproducibility and rapid turnaround time. Combined with its uniquely low DNA and RNA sample input requirements from Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissues (as little as 10ng extracted nucleic acid per reaction), the Ion Torrent-based sequencing platform and reagents offer comprehensive sequence analysis of a wider variety of tumor samples, including limited or compromised specimens derived from FFPE tissue or fine needle aspirates. Incorporating oncology markers relevant to a broad range of cancers, the NGS panel will also provide a universal platform to enable potential new clinical indications for existing drugs and development of possible new therapies for other indications in the future.  The potential to generate a paradigm shift through this agreement - from one test for one drug, to one test for multiple NSCLC therapies, represents a significant step forward in realizing the promise of precision medicine,  said Mark Stevenson, president of life sciences solutions for Thermo Fisher Scientific.  We look forward to building upon our ongoing collaboration with Novartis and Pfizer to lead the efforts in building potential novel NGS testing approaches to advance the future of cancer care.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-uk-facility-to-accelerate-drug-discovery-203095,New UK Facility to Accelerate Drug Discovery Diamond s on site fragment screening facility a major boost for structural biologists  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. From now, scientists working to design new medicines to treat a wide range of diseases will have access to a world-first facility based at Diamond Light Source   the UK s national synchrotron science facility   for accelerating the process of developing novel compounds for drug discovery. Prof Dave Stuart, Diamond s Director of Life Sciences and Head of the Division of Structural Biology in the Department of Clinical Medicine at the University of Oxford, comments:  We are delighted to be able to offer the new XChem facility to both academic groups and drug development companies so that they can speed up the early stages of rational drug design.   Scientists are using Diamond to study a wide range of viral and bacterial infections, along with cancer, heart disease, diabetes and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer s and Parkinson s. While great progress is being made, on average it still takes at least ten years for a new medicine to complete the journey from initial discovery to the marketplace. Having a facility like XChem at the synchrotron is therefore a major step forward, allowing scientists to evaluate the equivalent of millions of compounds using just a few hundred much smaller compounds (named  fragments ). We believe it will give a particular boost to the combat of neglected diseases, where non-commercial research plays a major role, thereby greatly amplifying the impact of making available cutting-edge drug discovery technology. Though well-established, the screening technique has not to date has not been available in a central facility location to scientists from across the UK and beyond. Moreover XChem introduces a step-change in the sensitivity of the experiment, by harnessing synchrotron X-rays so that fragments can be directly observed interacting with the target protein. This allows structural biologists to identify where drugs could potentially bind, to target that particular area for further research. The duration of the experiment has also been shrunk from months to days, through extensive streamlining by new technologies developed at Diamond and in partnership with the Structural Genomics Consortium at Oxford University, delivering unprecedented performance and making it possible to support a wide user base. A key advantage for UK science is that this best-practice experimental procedure will now be available to large numbers of scientists from academia, along with researchers conducting R&D work for SMEs and large pharmaceuticals, all of whom are looking to advance their structural based drug design activity. Dr Frank von Delft, jointly head of the XChem facility and the partnering lab at Oxford University, remarks,  It is only a world-class national synchrotron like Diamond that makes such a facility conceivable, and it is its strong collaborative links with the UK s universities that then leads to the creation of next-generation technologies like XChem.  The integrated facilities on offer at Diamond place the UK at the forefront of life science research. Life sciences minister, George Freeman MP comments:  This development from Diamond shows the UK punches above its weight in the field of structural biology. The techniques on offer at XChem will save both time and money by swiftly identifying the most promising drug targets before more in-depth research takes place. This will help drive innovation in vaccine design, and the prevention of antibiotic resistance.  John Barker, Vice President Structural Biology at Evotec, adds,  Building on an established relationship formed over many years of successful collaboration, Evotec and Diamond have worked closely to deliver the XChem platform for rapid identification of novel starting points for drug discovery campaigns for the drug discovery community. The new fragment-based discovery platform complements the breadth of techniques available at established companies, such as Evotec, while opening a new path to discovery for academic groups. Evotec is already making use of the XChem facility. Although details remain confidential for these early drug discovery campaigns, invaluable information is helping to progress multiple therapeutic targets for our international collaborators.  A recent discovery that has the potential to benefit from the fragment screening facility has been led by a team of scientists from the University of Leicester. They have successfully solved the structure of the elusive protein pneumolysin. This toxin, which is secreted by Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, is capable of killing cells. In doing so, it helps these bacteria, which are responsible for a range of serious illnesses including pneumonia, meningitis and septicaemia, to take hold in humans. Funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council, the University of Leicester research was led by Professor Russell Wallis of the Departments of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation and Molecular and Cell Biology and Professor Peter Andrew, Head of Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation. The crystal structure, published in the journal Scientific Reports, also represents a significant milestone for Diamond. Pneumolysin is the 3,000th protein structure to be solved at the facility and deposited in the Worldwide Protein Data Bank since Diamond came online in 2007. Russell Wallis said:  Our research is about a toxin called pneumolysin produced by a bacterium called pneumococcus (aka Streptococcus pneumoniae). Pneumococcal infections are the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia as well as the cause of a range of other life-threatening diseases such as meningitis and septicaemia. Pneumolysin is instrumental in the ability of pneumococcus to cause disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that more than 1.6 million people die every year from pneumococcal infections, including more than 800,000 children under 5 years old.  The aim of the research was to find out how pneumolysin kills our cells, thereby causing tissue damage and contributing to disease. In particular we wanted to find out how multiple copies of the toxin assemble on the surface of cells.  We managed to determine the structure of pneumolysin using a technique called X-ray crystallography, which enables us to see the individual atoms of the toxin. The structure not only reveals what the toxin looks like, but also shows how it assembles to form lethal pores.  Ours is the first detailed structure of pneumolysin. This level of detail is important and useful because it enables us to begin to understand how the toxin works. For example, we can see which parts of the toxin come together during pore assembly. When we disrupt these contacts, the toxin becomes inactivated so it can no longer kill cells.  Using crystallography beamlines at Diamond Light Source, our team has been able to determine the full-length pneumolysin at high-resolution (ten millionths of a millimetre). Down at this level, we can determine the molecular interactions on the cell membrane and work out exactly how the protein forms the pores that are lethal to the body s cells. Having this knowledge is very exciting as it forms the basis for rational approaches to designing drugs that block assembly of pneumolysin pores to treat people with pneumococcal disease. The University of Leicester has recently set up a company, Axendos Therapeutics, to pursue this aim. Dave Stuart adds:  This is a fantastic achievement for the Leicester group and a significant milestone for Diamond. We are one of the top synchrotrons in the world when it comes to the number of proteins that scientists are depositing in the Protein Data Bank. We have reached the 3,000th structure at a very exciting point in our development with several new life science beamlines under construction as part of Diamond s Phase III expansion.  He continues:  Ultimately, this work reinforces Diamond s role as a vital source of structural information and demonstrates how integral science is throughout the development process, from fundamental work to delivering new drugs.

The finding could have implications for dietary interventions for the disorder. Fatty acids are a major area of interest in bipolar disorder and depression because of their biological importance in the brain. Studies have shown that fatty acid supplementation may be useful for unipolar depression, but the data has been more mixed for bipolar disorder. The researchers, led by Erika Saunders, associate professor and chair of psychiatry, Penn State College of Medicine, compared fatty acids in 27 people with symptomatic bipolar disorder and 31 healthy control subjects. The group measured levels of different forms of the polyunsaturated fatty acids omega-3 and omega-6. They also collected self-reported information on fatty acid consumption and bipolar medication use. Their results were published in the journal Bipolar Disorders. Free fatty acids are able to cross the blood-brain barrier, while fatty acids bound to proteins are not. In study subjects with bipolar disorder, the ratio of a free-circulating omega-3 fatty acid called EPA to bound EPA was lower than in other people. ""This means that the availability of omega-3 in the body is lower in bipolar subjects,"" Saunders said. Omega-3 fatty acids are a large component of brain-cell membranes and are important for cell-to-cell communication in the brain. In the study, the ratio of free to bound EPA correlated with clinical bipolar symptoms, specifically mania and tendency towards suicide. Fatty acids also play an important role in the immune system and the inflammatory system. ""Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids can shift the balance of inflammation, which we think is important in bipolar disorder,"" Saunders said. However, the researchers did not find altered ratios of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids in bipolar subjects. Although the researchers did find lower levels of omega-3s in patients with bipolar disorder that correlated with symptoms, Saunders said it's too early to advise dietary changes or omega-3 supplementation. Omega-3 fatty acids are abundant in fish, vegetable oils, nuts -- especially walnuts, flax seeds, flaxseed oil and leafy vegetables. There was no difference in self-reported fatty acid consumption between bipolar and healthy patients. ""Is that because we only included certain foods in the survey? Or is it because people couldn't accurately recall what they were eating?"" Saunders said. Another possibility the researchers are considering is that there are differences in how healthy people and people with bipolar disorder convert fatty acids from one form to another. Drugs that treat bipolar disorder are known to affect these conversions, but no association was found between fatty acid levels or ratios and self-reported medication use in the study. Saunders is currently investigating whether modifications in dietary intake of fatty acids could be useful in bipolar disorder. ""We are actively pursuing the next step in this line of inquiry to get to the point where we know what changes in diets are going to help people with bipolar disorder so they can have another option beyond the medications that are currently available,"" she said. A number of trials have turned up no benefit of omega-3 supplementation in bipolar disorder, a brain disorder that causes manic episodes of elevated mood, energy and cognition, and major depressive episodes of lowered mood, energy and cognition. Bipolar disorder affects between 1 and 4.4 percent of the population. ""I think our work, along with the work of others, shows that this is an important area for us to continue to study,  Saunders said.  It's complicated and hard to study, and there are a lot of factors, but it's an area we need to keep pursuing."" Most research on fatty acids in bipolar disorder measures levels of fatty acids in cell membranes. Saunders's group instead looked at circulating fatty acids in the blood, which is a better indication of dietary intake. Fatty acids in the blood are also the type that crosses the blood-brain barrier to enter the brain. Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center  press release Saunders EFH et al.

The findings suggest these mallet-shaped sensory organs, called halteres, may play multiple roles in how flies behave, providing clues to how brains absorb and use multiple streams of information. The discovery has implications for human health and engineering, providing insight about how the sense of the body's movement in space is integrated with visual information, and serving as a model for sensors that could enable bird or moth-size robots to fly, climb walls or manage other challenging situations. ""Halteres are like our inner ear vestibular system, which helps us stay upright and stabilizes our eyes,"" said Jessica Fox, an assistant professor of biology at Case Western Reserve and an author of the new study, published in the journal Biology Letters. ""They let flies know where they are in space and allow them to keep their eyes focused on a target."" Flies, all 200,000 species, are the only animals with halteres, which evolved from their hindwings. But how and when the organs are used differs depending on whether the flies are from the short-antenna suborder, called brachycerans, or the long-antenna suborder, called nematocerans, the researchers found. Different families within these suborders also showed differences in how they used their halteres. Members of the short-antenna group, including houseflies and hoverflies, consistently swing their halteres opposite, or at 180 degrees, to their wing flaps during flight. The long-antenna group, which includes mosquitoes and gnats and evolved earlier than the short-antenna group, showed variability in flight and on foot. All the flies used halteres to fly, but some swung the mallets opposite their wings; others in synchrony with their wings and still others in patterns with no clear relationship to their wing flaps, or even with each other. While walking, some brachycerans, like fruit flies and horse flies held their halteres steady, while others, like flesh flies and house flies, oscillated them in the same pattern as when flying. ""There's way more diversity of movement than we thought,"" Fox said. ""but we didn't know why."" To study haltere use, the researchers recorded 41 flies from 26 families in super-slow motion. All flies, no matter the suborder, needed halteres to fly. Without them, they could at best lift off but quickly lost control. In a series of pedestrian tests, all flies could walk without deficit on a stable, flat surface without halteres, indicating they received enough sensory information from their six feet to manage the task, the researcher said. When faced with walking up the side of a cup, however, flesh flies with intact halteres readily performed. But, after halteres were removed, fewer flies attempted to climb and those that did were more likely to fall down. Fruit flies, which didn't move their halteres while walking, didn't show any differences in climbing or falling when their halteres were removed. ""When things are challenging, halteres matter for those flies that move them,"" Fox said. Studying this system in flies can help researchers understand how the visual system and sense of balance works in humans, and also provide insight into sensory and movement disorders, Fox said. ""These biosensors can also be models for manmade sensors,"" she said. ""They're solving the same problems humans do but with a smaller set of neurons. Sensors like the ones that flies have could enable flying machines to land more smoothly, or help them climb walls."" Case Western Reserve UniversityHall JM et al.

The findings, which reveal how the ketogenic diet acts to block seizures in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, are published in the journal Brain. Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide and approximately a third of people diagnosed with epilepsy do not have seizures adequately controlled by current treatments. The research team have identified a specific fatty acid, decanoic acid, provided in the MCT (medium chain triglyceride, a chemical containing three fatty acids) ketogenic diet that has potent anti-epileptic effects.

These newborn brain cells play an important role in learning and memory. A new study has determined that mice that spent time running on wheels not only developed twice the normal number of new neurons, but also showed an increased ability to distinguish new objects from familiar objects. These results are published in the first issue of a new journal, Brain Plasticity.  Our research indicates that exercise-induced increase in neurogenesis improves pattern separation by supporting unique and detailed long-term representations of similar but nevertheless different memory items. Pattern separation is involved in many memory tasks of everyday life. For example, when learning the game of chess, it is critically important to remember the different shapes of pieces like the pawn and bishop. Similarly, remembering the precise pattern of pieces on the board during a previously successful opening or endgame may decide who will win or lose,  explained lead investigator Josef Bischofberger, PhD, Professor, Department of Biomedicine at the University of Basel.  This study provides novel evidence for running-induced enhanced pattern separation. The experiments are based on an innate behavior of mice, which are naturally curious and preferentially explore novel objects in their environment. Objects were designed to be more or less similar to each other, to test how precisely the animals remember object properties. This is unique, in being both not stressful and not requiring additional motivators, such as food or water deprivation, to demonstrate the beneficial effects of exercise on cognition,  commented Brian R. Christie, PhD, Co-Guest Editor of the issue and Professor, Neuroscience Graduate Program Director Division of Medical Sciences, University of Victoria, and Island Medical Program, University of British Columbia. Professor Bischofberger and co-investigators Stefanie Heigele, PhD, and Leoni Bolz tested two groups of mice, which were housed either without (sedentary) or with running wheels (voluntarily running) using a novel object recognition (NOR) task to assess learning and long-term memory. As rodents prefer to spend more time with novel objects than familiar ones, the researchers first exposed the mice to two identical objects (cones or pyramids, in either black or white). After 1.5 hours, one of the objects was replaced with a new object (cone for pyramid or vice versa) and the mice were observed. After 24 hours elapsed, the new object was again swapped, either with a similar object (same color but different shape) or a distinct object (different color and shape). After the short 1.5-hour interval, both running and sedentary mice were able to distinguish similar and distinct objects. However, after 24 hours, a difference was observed. Whereas distinct objects were remembered and recognized by both cohorts of mice, only the running mice could faithfully distinguish similar looking objects. Investigators determined therefore that the running mice had developed better pattern separation capabilities than sedentary mice. To investigate further, the researchers looked for changes in the brains of the mice. By using markers that could identify newly-formed brain cells, they found that running mice developed about twice as many new cells, and those cells had longer dendrites, compared to the sedentary mice, which facilitates the formation of new synaptic contacts between the nerve cells.  Although running induces both substantial changes in number and morphology of young neurons as well as significant changes in learning behavior, this does not prove a causal relationship,  noted Professor Bischofberger,  Nevertheless, our results, together with previous findings, suggest that the enhanced pattern separation during memory testing is most likely mediated via running-induced increase in adult neurogenesis.  The precise functional role of new neurons in the hippocampus remains under investigation. However, studies have shown that exercise can improve spatial navigation, contextual memory and the ability to distinguish between highly similar objects or stimuli (pattern separation) in rodents and humans.  Because exercise can increase the rate of new neurons being produced, it makes it an attractive candidate for therapeutic purposes. Studies have shown that exercise can have both structural and cognitive benefits in rodent models of pathological conditions like Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and Alzheimer s disease. Thus, increasing neurogenesis is a potential treatment for a variety of disorders that would benefit from improving cognitive capacity. Indeed, studies in humans indicate that exercise can preserve and possibly even enhance cognitive function in individuals with dementia or other forms of mild cognitive impairment,  added Dr. Christie.

But how do diverse brain networks coordinate well enough to hit the ball? A new University of California (UC), Berkeley, study suggests the human brain's aptitude and versatility can be credited in large part to ""connector hubs,"" which filter and route information. They coordinate and integrate the flow of data so that brain networks dedicated to specific roles, such as vision and movement, can focus on their jobs. ""Our findings show that connector hubs allow for distinct networks to each do their own thing, yet still interact with each other effectively,"" said study lead author Maxwell Bertolero, a PhD student in neuroscience at UC Berkeley. Moreover, the brain's two dozen or so connector hubs play a key role in complex cognitive tasks, and are vulnerable to brain damage and dysfunction. Thus, the findings could ""help neuroscientists shed more light on the neural bases of disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's, "" which are marked by malfunctions in the brain's wiring, Bertolero said. The findings are the result of a meta-analysis conducted by Bertolero and fellow researchers at UC Berkeley and the National University of Singapore of more than 9,000 brain imaging studies in the BrainMap database that cover more than 75 cognitive tasks. The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found heightened neural activity in the brain's connector hubs during complex tasks, such as puzzles and video games, while networks dedicated to specific functions did not need to put in extra work. The more complex the task, in that more networks were required for the task, the greater the activity in the connector hubs, keeping the burden off individual networks, the study found. Like an airline hub, the brain's main connector hubs link to multiple brain networks like transfer stations. These hubs have been found in the brains of many mammals, including mice and macaque monkeys. Previous studies have linked connector hubs to the coordination and integration of information between multiple brain networks, but this latest study measured exactly how much of the work was being done by the hubs vis- -vis networks dedicated to specific tasks. The experiments used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure increased blood flow throughout the brain, a marker of increased neural activity, during a wide range of activities, including finger-tapping, whistling, chewing, drawing, writing, reading, watching a movie and playing video games and memory games. Researchers mapped the brain's connections as one would analyze a large-scale network such as the US electrical grid, global flight patterns or LinkedIn professional connections, creating a model of the brain's ""connectome."" Using ""graph theory,"" which is used in many scientific fields to study networks, they identified 14 distinct networks of tightly interconnected regions and roughly 25 connector hubs. They then compared neural activity in the connector hubs to activity in each of the brain's dedicated networks during all the tasks recorded in the BrainMap database. They found that activity increased only at connector hubs as more networks were required for a task, indicating that connector hubs, but not individual networks, must process more information during these more complex tasks. Next, Bertolero said, he and his co-authors plan to look into why evolution built a brain with distinct networks and connector hubs, precisely how connector hubs integrate and coordinate, and what happens when they are damaged by a stroke, for example.

A brain protein called SNTF, which rises in the blood after some concussions, signals the type of brain damage that is thought to be the source of these cognitive impairments, according to a study led by researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK. ""The brain protein specifically indicates the presence of nerve fiber damage that we call diffuse axonal injury,"" said senior author Douglas H. Smith, MD, director of the Penn Center for Brain Injury and Repair and the Robert A. Groff Professor of Neurosurgery. ""Our findings also confirm that even relatively mild, concussion-type brain impacts can cause permanent damage of this kind."" The results, published in Acta Neuropathologica, suggest that blood tests for SNTF might one day be used to diagnose diffuse axonal injury and predict cognitive impairment in concussion patients. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the chief cause of death and disability among children and adults from 1 to 44 years of age in the United States, leading to more than two million emergency department visits annually. ""Mild"" TBI, or concussion often defined as a brief loss of normal brain function typically following a blow to the head is by far the most common form of TBI and frequently doesn't even receive medical attention. Although it is usually make a full recovery, studies in recent years suggest that roughly one in five concussion patients suffers cognitive impairment lasting several months or longer. The underlying mechanism of this impairment has long been something of a mystery, since concussed brains rarely show signs of bleeding, bruising or other obvious abnormalities on standard CT or MRI scans. However, in severe and fatal TBI cases, direct microscopic examination of the brain often reveals numerous swollen, degenerating, and even fully disconnected axons throughout the white matter -- characteristic of diffuse axonal injury. Many brain injury specialists now suspect that this same type of damage, albeit less extensive, occurs in concussion. Diffuse axonal injury arises from the sudden movement of the brain in TBI, which rapidly stretches bundles of axons that connect brain regions. Prior research by Smith and others suggests that while affected axons rarely rupture completely at the moment of impact, their sudden deformation causes abnormal inflows of sodium and calcium ions that help regulate a neuron's function. Investigators surmise that most affected axons manage to pump their sodium and calcium levels back to normal, regain their function, and slowly repair whatever structural damage they have sustained. In other axons, however, levels of calcium become high enough to trigger a self-destruct process, in which protein-breaking enzymes are unleashed, begin to degrade the axonal structure, and ultimately sever the nerve fiber completely. ""Once an axon disconnects and degenerates, it's never going to regrow to restore that communication pathway across the brain,"" Smith said. Previous work by Robert Siman, PhD, a research professor of Neurosurgery, has shown that this axon-destroying enzyme activity creates tell-tale byproducts. One of these is SNTF (alpha II-spectrin N-terminal fragment), which may be useful as a biomarker of permanent axonal injury. In two small studies published in 2013 and 2014, Siman, Smith and colleagues found that blood levels of SNTF tended to rise in the days after a concussion and tended to reach higher levels in people who ended up with greater cognitive dysfunction. In this new study, Smith, Siman, and their colleagues, sought to confirm that SNTF is a marker specifically of axonal injury in humans and in experimental studies. In severe traumatic brain injury with many pathological changes, SNTF staining of the brain predominantly identified only injured axons. Similarly, in experimental concussion models, where diffuse axonal injury is the main pathology, SNTF identified only a sub-population of degenerating axons. In addition, in a previous study, SNTF in blood samples corresponded to changes in axon tracts in the brains of concussed patients, seen with advanced MRI techniques. ""This suggests that we may soon have a blood biomarker for concussion akin to the standard blood test used to detect cardiac damage from heart attacks. SNTF in the blood of a concussed individual may provide a specific diagnosis of diffuse axonal injury as well as the process of axonal degeneration"" Siman said. The team also tested for the presence of a protein called APP, which is currently the standard marker of axon damage in autopsied brains, in sections of brain tissue. They found that there was almost no overlap between damaged axons identified with APP and those stained with SNTF. Smith suspects that APP marks many axons that are injured but have the potential to recover, whereas SNTF specifically marks the minority of injured axons in which the fatal self-destruct process has begun. ""We think it's probably the end of the road for those axons,"" he said. Through specialized therapies to strengthen brain connections, patients with axon loss and associated cognitive impairments from TBI may eventually recover normal cognitive function. Others never recover fully. For these individuals, there are no evidence-based rehabilitation strategies or therapies currently available. ""We're starting to believe that the term 'mild traumatic brain injury' is an oxymoron,"" Smith said. ""For some people there's nothing mild about it.""

The lab of synthetic chemist L szl  K rti made elusive chiral biaryl compounds in a single-flask process that does not require the use of transition metals. These biaryls are called organocatalysts because they catalyze chemical reactions without metal ions. They eliminate the need for transition metals and simplify chemical processes to synthesize new molecules. Transition metals are conductive metals that include titanium, iron, nickel, silver, copper, palladium and gold and are commonly used in catalysis. The new tools open avenues for faster and more cost-effective chemical synthesis, K rti said. Biaryls are molecular compounds of two aromatic rings directly joined by a carbon-carbon bond. When functionalized, or altered, these biaryls (phenyl-phenyl, naphthyl-phenyl, thienyl-naphthyl and more) become highly selective, reliable and customizable catalysts, K rti said. K rti s research uses biaryls as catalysts to develop novel single-enantiomer compounds. Enantiomers are asymmetrical molecules found among organic compounds. Like one s hands, their structures are mirror images that cannot be superimposed on each other. Significantly, these twins can have radically different effects   one beneficial, one not   as they interact with enzymes, proteins, receptors and even other chiral catalysts. Pharmaceutical companies understandably want to make drugs that contain only the helpful enantiomer. Currently, single-enantiomer compounds are painstakingly synthesized as building blocks for drugs, agricultural products and functional materials. K rti said that by decade s end, 95 percent of chiral drugs will be sold as single enantiomers. But synthesizing one particular enantiomer with precision and high efficiency is hard, especially via trial-and-error approaches that to now often require transition metal catalysts.  For enantiomer preparations, you need catalysts,  he said, but transition metals are expensive and can leave toxic residues that need to be removed before the compound can be used in clinical trials. The Rice lab s simple, cost-effective way to make chiral-functionalized biaryls not only eliminates the need for transition metals but can replace many steps in the synthesis process. Each step can take days or weeks.  That s the basis of what we do: Develop new methods,  K rti said.  Part of my program is coming up with new catalyst structures. When we were looking at the various ways to put such compounds together, we stumbled upon this very interesting reaction.  The lab combined readily available compounds, including quinone monoacetal and naphthol, to make functionalized biaryls.  This is a major advance,  he said.  Using these building blocks, we made 41 different chiral biaryl compounds in a relatively short time.  The functionalized chiral biaryls are really versatile compounds. You can use them outright as organocatalysts or complex them with transition metals to make new transition-metal catalysts. So the possibilities are unlimited. Moreover, these compounds can be used as building blocks en route to natural products with biaryl substructures in them.  He said the biaryls  open up an entire world of new chemical space,  as they lower the barrier to inventing and making new chemical compounds.  The implications are huge,  K rti said.  This will certainly find its way into drug discovery, making agrochemicals and many other fine chemicals. ","Published: November 25, 2015"

Their concept is to create the biological machinery for vaccine production en masse, put it in a freeze-dried state and stockpile it around the country. Then, when a new virus hits, labs can simply add water to a  kit  to rapidly produce vaccines.  You could just pull it off the shelf and make it,  said senior author Brad Bundy, associate professor of chemical engineering.  We could make the vaccine and be ready for distribution in a day.  The research demonstrates the ability to store the drug and vaccine-making machinery for more than a year.Traditional systems to produce vaccines for pandemic influenza strains require heavy engineering and specialized equipment that only a few labs across the country have on hand. These traditional systems are also time-consuming, taking months to execute. Bundy s idea is a new angle on the emerging method of  cell-free protein synthesis,  a process that combines DNA to make proteins needed for drugs (instead of growing protein in a cell). His lab is creating a system where the majority of the work is done beforehand so vaccine kits can be ready to go and be activated at the drop of a dime.  It will not only provide a quicker response to pandemics, but it will also make protein-based drugs more available to third-world countries where production and refrigerated storage can be problematic,  added William Pitt, a study coauthor and fellow BYU professor of chemical engineering. While the team is now testing their version of the cell-free, recombinant DNA process for vaccine production, they ve already successfully demonstrated it for at least one anti-cancer protein (onconase). The researchers believe their method can significantly reduce investment of time and money towards future drug production and, in turn, reduce treatment expenses for patients.  The drugs today are changing,  Bundy said.  The lifesaving cancer drugs we have now, the drugs for arthritis, the drugs with the greatest impact, are made out of proteins, not small chemical molecules. This method takes full advantage of that to provide a quicker, more personal response. ","Published: November 25, 2015"

Patients with glioblastoma have a five-year survival rate of less than 10 percent, Verbridge said. ""This statistic has not improved significantly in decades, and there is still no treatment option to preferentially target the glioma stem cells or diffuse infiltrative cells that lead to tumor recurrence after surgery, chemo, or radiotherapy,"" Verbridge said. The paper, ""Targeted cellular ablation based on the morphology of malignant cells,"" describes research into a new treatment option involving pulsed electric fields (PEFs) that is better at targeting and killing malignant cells while leaving healthy cells alive. Glioblastoma is particularly resistant to conventional and targeted cancer therapies, in part because tumors are made up of cells that are very different from one another. Surgical, chemical, radiation, and molecular treatments all have shortcomings that make it difficult to target malignant cells without damaging critical surrounding structures or prompting the emergence of therapy-resistant cells. Recurrence after initial treatment is extremely common as a result. In their work, Verbridge and Davalos are building on a technique patented by Davalos involving irreversible electroporation (IRE) of tumor cells by inserting electrodes directly into a tumor. This treatment has been successfully used to treat canine patients with similar brain tumors. Verbridge and Davalos have developed a high-frequency version of this therapy (HFIRE) that uses pulses delivered in a rapid burst. IRE and HFIRE are both capable of killing tumor cells, but the mechanism differs, the researchers found. IRE appears to cause cellular death by disrupting the outer cell membrane. HFIRE, in contrast, appears to also cause nuclear collapse. Mathematical models developed by the researchers predicted that the nuclear damage should scale with size of the nucleus relative to the cell. Because HFIRE targets the nucleus, the researchers hypothesized that malignant cells, which have larger nuclei compared to normal cells in many cancers including glioblastoma, would have a lower threshold for a lethal burst. Therefore, properly tuned HFIRE could target malignant cells while leaving normal, healthy cells unharmed. This was confirmed using 3-D tissue models consisting of co-cultures of normal and malignant brain cells. ""We're essentially destroying tumor cells based on their altered morphologies, specifically their enlarged nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio which has been known for decades to be a strong indicator of malignancy in many cancers. This is a completely different potential approach to targeted therapy,"" Verbridge said. Future experiments in vivo will be necessary to determine exactly how selective HFIRE ablation therapy will be, but the researchers expressed confidence that such a therapy, either on its own or in combination with other treatments, could be effective at killing the invasive glioblastoma cells that so often lead to tumor recurrence after initial rounds of treatment.","Published: November 25, 2015"

They ve identified several noncoding RNA molecules of viral origins that are necessary for a fertilized human egg to acquire the ability in early development to become all the cells and tissues of the body. Blocking the production of this RNA molecule stops development in its tracks, they found. The discovery comes on the heels of a Stanford study earlier this year showing that early human embryos are packed full of what appear to be viral particles arising from similar left-behind genetic material.  We re starting to accumulate evidence that these viral sequences, which originally may have threatened the survival of our species, were co-opted by our genomes for their own benefit,  said Vittorio Sebastiano, PhD, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology.  In this manner, they may even have contributed species-specific characteristics and fundamental cell processes, even in humans.  Sebastiano is a co-lead and co-senior author of the study. Postdoctoral scholar Jens Durruthy-Durruthy, PhD, is the other lead author. The other senior author of the paper is Renee Reijo Pera, PhD, a former professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford who is now on the faculty of Montana State University. Sebastiano and his colleagues were interested in learning how cells become pluripotent, or able to become any tissue in the body. A human egg becomes pluripotent after fertilization, for example. And scientists have learned how to induce other, fully developed human cells to become pluripotent by exposing them to proteins known to be present in the very early human embryo. But the nitty-gritty molecular details of this transformative process are not well understood in either case. An ancient infection The researchers knew that a type of RNA molecules called long-intergenic noncoding, or lincRNAs, have been implicated in many important biological processes, including the acquisition of pluripotency. These molecules are made from DNA in the genome, but they don t go on to make proteins. Instead they function as RNA molecules to affect the expression of other genes.  Sebastiano and Durruthy-Durruthy used recently developed RNA sequencing techniques to examine which lincRNAs are highly expressed in human embryonic stem cells. Previously, this type of analysis was stymied by the fact that many of the molecules contain highly similar, very repetitive regions that are difficult to sequence accurately. They identified more than 2,000 previously unknown RNA sequences, and found that 146 are specifically expressed in embryonic stem cells. They homed in on the 23 most highly expressed sequences, which they termed HPAT1-23, for further study. Thirteen of these, they found, were made up almost entirely of genetic material left behind after an eons-ago infection by a virus called HERV-H. HERV-H is what s known as a retrovirus. These viruses spread by inserting their genetic material into the genome of an infected cell. In this way, the virus can use the cell s protein-making machinery to generate viral proteins for assembly into a new viral particle. That particle then goes on to infect other cells. If the infected cell is a sperm or an egg, the retroviral sequence can also be passed to future generations. HIV is one common retrovirus that currently causes disease in humans. But our genomes are also littered with sequences left behind from long-ago retroviral infections. Unlike HIV, which can go on to infect new cells, these retroviral sequences are thought to be relatively inert; millions of years of evolution and accumulated mutations mean that few maintain the capacity to give instructions for functional proteins. After identifying HPAT1-23 in embryonic stem cells, Sebastiano and his colleagues studied their expression in human blastocysts   the hollow clump of cells that arises from the egg in the first days after fertilization. They found that HPAT2, HPAT3 and HPAT5 were expressed only in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, which becomes the developing fetus. Blocking their expression in one cell of a two-celled embryo stopped the affected cell from contributing to the embryo s inner cell mass. Further studies showed that the expression of the three genes is also required for efficient reprogramming of adult cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. Sequences found only in primates  This is the first time that these virally derived RNA molecules have been shown to be directly involved with and necessary for vital steps of human development,  Sebastiano said.  What s really interesting is that these sequences are found only in primates, raising the possibility that their function may have contributed to unique characteristics that distinguish humans from other animals.  The researchers are continuing their studies of all the HPAT molecules. They ve learned that HPAT-5 specifically affects pluripotency by interacting with and sequestering members of another family of RNAs involved in pluripotency called let-7.  Previously retroviral elements were considered to be a class that all functioned in basically the same way,  said Durruthy-Durruthy.  Now we re learning that they function as individual elements with very specific and important roles in our cells. It s fascinating to imagine how, during the course of evolution, primates began to recycle these viral leftovers into something that s beneficial and necessary to our development.

James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute (OSUCCC   James).  AR-42 is part of a class of drugs known as HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors, which are designed to block proteins that play a key role in mediating skeletal muscle breakdown. In cancer, HDAC proteins also tend to drive the pathways in cancer cells that lead to aggressive cancers. AR-42 is unique among HDAC inhibitors because it appears to have beneficial effects on muscle health and function, according to this new OSUCCC   James research. In this new preclinical study, Tanios Bekaii-Saab, MD, and colleagues report data illustrating that orally administered AR-42 can significantly preserve body weight and prolong survival while simultaneously preventing the loss of muscle and fat tissue mass and preserving the health/strength of muscle. According to Bekaii-Saab, most advanced cancer patients will experience significant loss of muscle mass as the result of their cancer at some point during their treatment, a condition clinically known as  cachexia.  The condition is most common in pancreas and gastrointestinal cancers, with up to 70 to 80 percent of patients experiencing severe loss of muscle mass that impacts their ability to tolerate necessary treatments. The molecular mechanisms behind why this occurs are not well understood, so there are currently no good intervention strategies to reverse the effects of cachexia.  Roughly a third of pancreatic cancer patients die from the impact of cachexia   not their cancer. Finding better intervention strategies for the condition is critical so we can keep our patients strong enough to tolerate the cancer treatments necessary to give them the best chances of eradicating their cancer,  says Bekaii-Saab, gastrointestinal oncology section chief and corresponding author of the current study. Study Design and Methods AR-42 was developed in the lab of Ching-Shih Chen, PhD, a professor and scientist with the OSUCCC   James Molecular Carcinogenesis and Chemoprevention research program. For this study, researchers evaluated AR-42 against two other HDAC inhibitors called vorinostat and romidepsin to determine each agent s ability to prevent cachexia. This was done using metabolomic profiling to evaluate the pathways involved in muscle changes that lead to cachexia as well as other advanced molecular testing. AR-42 was the only agent shown to have a strong protective effect against tumor-associated muscle wasting. These findings were confirmed in a second preclinical model.  These new findings show that AR-42 can preserve muscle and every aspect of its functionality, which is an important step in refining methods of potential of stopping cancer cachexia,  says Chen.   Researchers expect to begin evaluating AR-42 in human pancreatic cancer clinical trials within a year. Funding support for this work comes from the Lucius A. Wing Endowed Chair Fund, Cure for Pancreatic Cancer Philanthropic Fund and a pancreatic cancer research grant from The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and OSUCCC   James.","Published: November 25, 2015"

The advance could be an important new step in the effort to satisfy the world s need for clean water for drinking, irrigation and recreational use. Current methods require multiple steps and involve chemicals that react to heat, sunlight or electricity. Scientists previously had shown that polluted water could be cleaned using enzymatic activities of naturally occurring bacteria and fungi, which breaks down pollutants into their harmless chemical components. But that method carries the risk of releasing dangerous organisms into the water.   The new UCLA technique, developed by a team led by Shaily Mahendra, a UCLA associate professor of civil and environmental engineering, and Leonard Rome, a professor of biological chemistry and associate director of CNSI, is a variation of that method. The researchers put enzymes into nanoscale particles called  vaults,  then deposit the tiny particles into polluted water. Mahendra said microbial processes in water that are part of the natural system of biodegradation would eventually break down pollution in our water, but only over a very long period.  Natural microbes are why the world isn t still covered with dinosaur droppings,  Mahendra said.  But we don t have the time or room on our planet to ignore contaminated lakes and rivers for a couple of million years while nature does the work.  Nanoscale vaults are tiny particles   just billionths of a meter across   that are shaped like beer kegs. Mahendra said the new method is effective because the vaults protect the enzymes, keeping them intact and potent when placed in the contaminated water. The scientists tested the method using an enzyme called manganese peroxidase. They found that over a 24-hour period the vaults removed three times as much phenol from the water as the enzyme did when it was dropped into the water without using vaults. They also discovered that because the manganese peroxidase remained stable inside of the vaults, it was still able to remove phenol from the water after 48 hours. Free manganese peroxide was completely inactive after 7 1/2 hours. Vault nanoparticles, which are constructed of proteins and are present in the cells of nearly all living things, were discovered by Rome and Nancy Kedersha, his then-postdoctoral student, in the 1980s. Each human cell contains thousands of vaults, which themselves contain other proteins. But Rome and his colleagues eventually devised a method for building empty vaults that could be used to deliver drugs to specific cells the body to fight cancer, HIV and other diseases. The research contributes to the goals of UCLA s Sustainable L.A. Grand Challenge, a campuswide initiative to transition the Los Angeles region to 100 percent renewable energy, local water and enhanced ecosystem health by 2050. Mahendra is also helping develop the work plan for Sustainable L.A. Mahendra said the new technique could be scaled up within a few years for commercial use in polluted lakes and rivers, and vaults could be added to membrane filtration units and easily incorporated into existing water treatment systems. Vaults containing several different biodegrading enzymes could potentially remove several contaminants at once from the same water source. They would be unlikely to pose risks to humans or the environment, Rome said, because vaults grow in the cells of so many species. The vaults containing manganese peroxidase used for the new study were built by a team led by Valerie Kickhoefer, an associate researcher working with Rome. Also contributing to the study were first author Meng Wang, a graduate student in Mahendra s lab, and UCLA staff research associate Danny Abad.","Published: November 25, 2015"

Cancer can occur when these signals are ""dysregulated"" and abnormal cells grow out of control. In the Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University researcher Mathieu Crupi studies the RET protein that is present on the surface of cells in your body and is responsible for receiving signals from outside a cell and passing on the messages within the cell. As part of a research team working with Dr. Lois Mulligan, he has identified important molecules that allow the RET protein to enter a cell and regulate its signals. RET is a protein that plays an important role in kidney and nerve development and is also important in many human cancers including thyroid, breast and pancreas. ""Since RET has been shown to contribute to many different cancer types, understanding how active RET moves into the cell and is 'turned off' in normal cells may in future provide us with therapeutic opportunities to control its function in cancer cells,"" says Mr. Crupi. ""The movement of proteins from the cell surface into compartments within the cell is an important process regulating the duration and magnitude of the signals that cause cells to grow, mature or survive,"" says Mr. Crupi.

""Just knowing that utensils may lead to cross-contamination is important,"" Erickson said. ""With that knowledge, consumers are then more likely to make sure they wash them in between uses."" Erickson has been researching produce for the past 10 years. Her past work has mainly focused on the fate of bacteria on produce when it's introduced to plants in the field during farming. In 2013, she was co-author on a study looking at the transfer of norovirus and hepatitis A between produce and common kitchen utensils finding that cutting and grating increased the number of contaminated produce items when that utensil had first been used to process a contaminated item. This study is similar in that it considers the influence that knives and graters have on the transfer of pathogenic bacteria to and from produce items. She urges consumers to realize that these germs can spread in their kitchens as well. Researchers have known that poor hygiene and improper food preparation practices in a consumer's home can lead to foodborne illnesses, but considering what practices in the kitchen are more likely to lead to contamination has not been examined extensively. ""The FDA was interested in getting more accurate numbers as to what level of cross-contamination could occur in the kitchen using standard practices,"" Erickson said. In her recent study, Erickson contaminated many types of fruits and vegetables in her lab adding certain pathogens that often can be found on these foods, such as salmonella and E. coli. Using a knife, Erickson would cut into things like tomatoes or cantaloupe and other types of produce to see how easily the bacteria could spread when the knife was continuously used without being cleaned. Because they ""were looking at what would be the worst-case scenario,"" she said, Erickson and study co-authors did not wash between cutting these different produce items. Researchers also grated produce, like carrots, to see how easily the pathogens spread to graters. They found that both knives and graters can cause additional cross-contamination in the kitchen and that the pathogens were spread from produce to produce if they hadn't washed the utensils. ""A lot of the broken up material and particles from the contaminated produce remained on the graters,"" said Erickson, who conducts her research at the UGA Center for Food Safety in Griffin. ""Then if you were to shred another carrot or something else immediately after that, it gets contaminated, too."" The study also found that certain fruits and vegetables spread pathogens to knives to different degrees. ""For items like tomatoes, we tended to have a higher contamination of the knives than when we cut strawberries,"" Erickson said. ""We don't have a specific answer as to why there are differences between the different produce groups. But we do know that once a pathogen gets on the food, it's difficult to remove."" Knives and graters aren't the only utensils in the kitchen consumers should be worried about. Erickson has also helped study the role brushes and peelers have on the transfer of dangerous kitchen bacteria. In concurrent studies, Erickson found that scrubbing or peeling produce items like melons, carrots and celery did not eliminate contamination on the produce item but led to contamination of the brush or peeler. Even when placed under running water, the utensils still became contaminated; however, the ability to cross-contaminate later produce items depended on the brush type and the pathogenic agent. These studies combined give researchers a better idea as to how common cross-contamination is in the kitchen even when just using standard practices. Erickson explained there is a small chance of buying fruits and vegetables contaminated with bacteria, but the problem can occur-whether the product is store-bought or locally grown.","Published: November 25, 2015"

The researchers, together with scientists at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, discovered that a common symptom of Alzheimer's disease the accumulation of amyloid plaques along blood vessels could be disrupting blood flow in the brain. The results are published in the journal Brain. ""We've always been interested in how glial cells interact with blood vessels,"" said Harald Sontheimer, director of the Center for Glial Biology in Health, Disease, and Cancer at the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute and senior author of the paper. ""Astrocytes are the most populous cell type in the brain and even outnumber neurons."" Sontheimer also noted the importance of astrocyte function in the brain. ""Astrocytes serve many support functions, such as shuttling nutrients from blood vessels to nerve cells or removing their waste products,"" said Sontheimer, who is also the I. D. Wilson Chair in Virginia Tech's College of Science. ""They also control the diameter of blood vessels to assure proper nutrient and oxygen delivery to the brain and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier. In response to injury and disease, however, astrocytes become reactive and change many of their supportive properties."" Sontheimer's team discovered that the astrocytes' blood flow regulation is disrupted by plaques formed of misfolded amyloid protein around blood vessels. In a healthy brain, amyloid protein fragments are routinely broken down and eliminated. The presence of amyloid proteins around blood vessels in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, yet it wasn't understood if the proteins did any harm. Now, Sontheimer's team has found that they do. ""We found that amyloid deposits separated astrocytes from the blood vessel wall,"" said Stefanie Robel, a research assistant professor at the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute and a coauthor of the paper. ""We also found that these amyloid deposits form an exoskeleton around the blood vessels, a kind of cast that reduces the pliability of the vessels."" The exoskeleton is known as a vascular amyloid. Its inelasticity might result in lower blood flow, which could account for Alzheimer's symptoms, such as memory lapses, impaired decision-making, and personality changes. ""Vascular amyloid may be the culprit in Alzheimer's disease symptoms, especially considering that the amyloid exoskeleton might limit the supply of oxygen and glucose to the brain regions that need them most,"" Sontheimer said. ""This could also explain the cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer's disease, as the disease is associated with reduced cerebral blood flow."" While the scientists don't fully understand the role of vascular amyloid in Alzheimer's disease, they now have a possible therapeutic target to study. ""It may be helpful to remove the deposits to allow for appropriate blood flow,"" Robel said. ""The problem is we don't know. It might be harmful to remove vascular amyloid at late stages of the disease; maybe they're actually holding the vessels together."" The researchers' next step will be to examine blood vessels once the amyloid deposits are removed. ""Vascular amyloid is strangling the blood vessels,"" Sontheimer said. ""By removing them, maybe we'll be able to restore blood flow regulation. Perhaps it'll turn out vascular amyloid is preventing further degeneration.

""This study has given us a better understanding that obesity has a neurological disorder component, and the findings have the potential to affect treatment of obese patients."" In the United States, nearly 12.7 million children are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These children are at a higher risk to develop high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and breathing and joint problems, among many other health issues. They are also more likely to become obese adults. The researchers studied 30 children between the ages of 6 and 10 years old. Half of the children had a normal body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 24, and the other half exhibited a BMI over 30, which is classified as obese. Each child was presented with three odor samples: chocolate, onion and a neutral odor of diluted acetone. As the participants smelled the samples, two MRI techniques functional MRI (fMRI) and functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) were used to measure brain activity. An evaluation of the fMRI results showed that in the obese children, the food odors triggered activation in the areas of the brain associated with impulse and the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder, while the areas of the brain associated with impulse control exhibited no activity. However, in the children with a normal BMI, the areas of the brain associated with pleasure regulation, organization and planning, as well as regions governing emotional processing or memory function, became more active. In addition, the fcMRI results showed that when the normal-weight children smelled the onion, there was a connection between the gustatory cortex, which processes taste, and the area of the brain linked to reward anticipation. This connection did not occur in the obese children. The chocolate smell elicited significant brain connections in obese children, compared to the normal-weight children. ""If we are able to identify the mechanisms that cause obesity, we will be able to change the way we treat these patients, and in turn, reduce obesity prevalence and save lives,"" Dr. Dies-Suarez said.

The process attaches disease-related protein fragments called autoantigens to spleen cells to prevent a disease known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, or EAE, which causes brain and spinal cord inflammation in animal models. EAE is commonly used in research because it mimics some of the traits of multiple sclerosis (MS) in humans. MS is a disorder in which the immune system attacks brain, spinal cord and optic nerves, damaging the fatty substance that ""insulates"" nerve fibers and interrupting nerve impulses. An estimated 400,000 people in the United States and 2.5 million people worldwide have the disease, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation. An infusion of spleen cells coupled with an autoantigen completely prevented EAE in a mouse model, said Chang-Qing Xia, MD, PhD, a research assistant professor in the UF College of Medicine's department of pathology, immunology and laboratory medicine. The same method also ""dramatically reversed"" the disease in its early stages, researchers found. The findings are published in the Journal of Immunology Research. The approach used to treat autoimmune diseases isn't new. But Xia and his collaborators from Capital Medical University in China coupled the autoantigens to the spleen cells using a different chemical known as sulfo-SMCC, or SMCC, that is already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for drug delivery in several clinical trials. Compared with the previously reported autoantigen-coupling method known as EDCI, this method makes the process faster, easier and less toxic to cells, Xia said. While EAE in animals isn't identical to MS, Xia said there are enough similarities to believe that the same immunotherapy approach could eventually be used to treat humans. ""The most important thing is that these findings are highly translatable to the clinic,"" Xia said. This is how the process works: Protein fragments of the nerve insulation substance known as myelin are coupled with spleen cells and injected into mouse models. After more than two months, researchers found that the treatments had completely prevented EAE from developing. Likewise, the same approach also reversed EAE in its early stages. Researchers believe that the spleen cell-autoantigen combination activates the production of helpful immune system cells while suppressing the disease-causing activities of other cells linked to autoimmune diseases. While no clinical trials have been scheduled, Xia said his new approach shows potential for making the leap from the laboratory to the clinic. Sulfo-SMCC, the chemical used to bind the autoantigen to spleen cells, has already been used for drug delivery in some clinical trials. Because the chemical is already in use, that could shorten the amount of time needed to get the new process tested in humans, Xia said. If used in humans someday, it's likely the protein fragments known as autoantigens would be coupled to peripheral white blood cells and delivered by transfusion. The same principle that makes the autoantigen therapy effective against EAE in mice should be able to benefit humans, according to Xia. ""If it works on EAE, it also should work on MS because the two diseases are similar immunologically and pathologically,"" he hypothesized. Next, Xia said he hopes to move the method into clinical trials if he can get other researchers interested in trying the technique.

Every second of every day, the 100 billion neurons in your brain are capable of firing off a burst of electricity, an action potential, up to 100 times per second. For neurologists trying to study how this overwhelming amount of activity across an entire brain translates into specific thoughts and behaviors, the task can be well overwhelming. That s because existing techniques for monitoring neurons are too slow or have too narrow a scope to generate a holistic view. But in a new study, researchers at Stanford University and Duke University reveal a technique for watching the brain s neurons in action with a temporal resolution of about 0.2 milliseconds a speed that is just fast enough to capture the action potentials in mammalian brains.  We set out to combine a protein that can quickly sense neural voltage potentials with another protein that can amplify its signal output,  said Yiyang Gong, assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Duke and first author on the paper.  The resulting increase in sensor speed matches what is needed to read out electrical spikes in the brains of live animals.  Then working as a postdoc in the laboratory of Mark Schnitzer, associate professor of biological sciences and applied physics at Stanford, and an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Gong and his colleagues sought out a voltage sensor fast enough to keep up with neurons. After several trials, the group landed on one found in algae, and engineered a version that is both sensitive to voltage activity and responds to the activity very quickly. The amount of light it put out, however, wasn t bright enough to be useful in experiments. It needed an amplifier. To meet this engineering challenge, Gong fused the newly engineered voltage sensor to the brightest fluorescing protein available at the time. He linked the two close enough to interact optically without slowing the system down.  When the voltage sensing component we engineered detects a voltage potential, it absorbs more light,  explained Gong.  And by absorbing more of the bright fluorescent protein s light, the overall fluorescence of the system dims in response to a neuron firing.

Credit: Y.Gong, Duke  The new sensor was delivered to the brains of mice using a virus and incorporated into fruit flies through genetic modification. In both cases, the researchers were able to express the protein in the neurons they chose and observe their voltage activity. They were also able to read voltage movements in different sub-compartments of individual neurons, which is very difficult to do with other techniques.  Being able to read voltage spikes directly from the brain and also see their specific timing is very helpful in determining how brain activity drives animal behavior,  said Gong.  Our hope is that the community will explore those types of questions in more detail using this particular sensor.

In the world of bacteria, it's thrive or fail to survive. Evolve or go extinct. Caitlin Pepperell, professor of medicine and medical microbiology and immunology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, wants to know more about microbes and their interactions with their human environments, particularly as more pathogens evolve resistance to the drugs we use to combat them. In a new study Pepperell and colleagues at UW-Madison probed the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, to learn more about how individual bacterial cells change and adapt while in the human body.""If you understand what evolutionary tricks the bug has, you are in a better position to tackle the emergence of resistance,"" says Pepperell, who is also an infectious disease physician. ""What you want to do when you treat an infection is cause extinction, and the more you know about how the bacterial population evolves, the smarter you can be about making it go extinct."" The researchers wanted to know: How diverse are the bacterial cells that reside within a single person? Where in the bacterial genetic code are the changes that lead to adaptation most extreme? ""Really, we set out to find patterns of diversity and what we could learn from them,"" Pepperell says. To do this, they needed data in the form of the long strings of letters that make up the genetic code of individual tuberculosis bacterial cells harbored by patients with the disease. Tuberculosis bacteria primarily infect the lungs but can be found anywhere in the body, including the brain and kidneys. The researchers found data collected from five patients in three previous studies, all of whom had severe disease and developed resistance to at least one common tuberculosis drug. The available data had been collected over time, as the patients underwent treatment and their disease progressed. Two ultimately died of tuberculosis, which was once the leading cause of death in the United States and is still often fatal, especially among people who develop drug resistant disease. Since the researchers were interested in the evolution of the bacteria within each patient, they compared the genetic codes of the individual bacterial cells collected from each. They looked at how many letters within the code differed from one cell to the next within each patient and they looked at how much overall variation there was between each bacterial cell. From this, they derived a numerical way to describe the diversity of the bacterial populations found in each patient over time. Most studies describe tuberculosis diversity by comparing one patient's tuberculosis to another, so that 50 patients might represent 50 different types of tuberculosis bacteria. Pepperell calls this the ""sky-level view."" However, Pepperell says in their study they ""zoomed in"" and looked at the patterns of diversity of bacteria harbored by a single person with tuberculosis. Among individual patients with severe disease, they found vast diversity, even more so than between patients studied at sky-level. The findings mean there is more tuberculosis diversity within a single person with severe illness than there is tuberculosis diversity between people with the disease. According to the World Health Organization, in 2014, 9.6 million people were sickened with tuberculosis, including 1 million children, and nearly 500,000 people developed multidrug-resistant disease. One third of the global population is infected with the tuberculosis bacteria, though only one in 10 of them will become sick with the disease in their lifetime. The researchers also found that tuberculosis bacteria evolve substantially within their human hosts due to the pressures they face there, and that much of the genetic changes occur among the genes involved in making, regulating and transporting the cellular chemicals that form the fatty, waxy outer covering of the bacteria. Other scientists studying everything from humans to mice have figured out that these genes interact with and manipulate the human immune system, says Pepperell. The researchers speculate the variability and redundancy in these cell envelope genes provide flexibility for the bacteria to rapidly adapt and become drug resistant. This may present potential targets for new drugs in the future, or even vaccines to prevent tuberculosis infection. With the data, Pepperell says they were also curious whether drug treatment reduced the diversity of the tuberculosis bacteria population in individual patients. ""We would hope, intuitively, that if you have a big, diverse population of bacteria and then you give treatment, the population of bacteria shrinks and there should be less diversity,"" Pepperell says. ""We did not see that."" However, the team learned that as the severity of a person's illness progressed, the diversity of their bacteria increased. ""What leads to someone dying of tuberculosis is the bacterial population getting completely out of control,"" Pepperell says. New technology enabled the team to conduct the study this way, Pepperell says, and it's allowing other researchers to survey entire bacterial populations within the expansive environment that is the individual human body. ""When you think about it, it makes sense to do this, because the human body is where a microbe does its business,"" she says. It's the environment that impacts each person's bacterial residents most. ""If you only ever looked at one cell from this person and one cell from another person, you would be missing out on a lot of information about the environment the bacteria lives in, what it's doing, what it's responding to, what it has to cope with,"" Pepperell says.

Various forms of biotechnology including artificial insemination, genetic markers for breeding, molecular diagnostics and vaccines, have already benefited food-animal production through improved genetics, nutrition and health, says Van Eenennaam. She suggests, however, that efforts to develop even healthier and more productive food animals through genetic engineering are being thwarted by complex national and international regulations that are being triggered by the use of modern biotechnologies in the breeding process, rather than by an evaluation of potential risks and benefits posed by the resulting animals themselves.  Globally, more than 20 percent of animal protein is lost as a result of disease,  says Van Eenennaam.  Efforts are underway to use recombinant DNA technology and related genetic engineering methods to specifically develop food animals that are resistant to some of these major diseases. However, domestic and international regulations have, until now, prevented any such animals from being approved for sale and consumption.  [It should be noted that on Nov. 19, just days before publication of this paper, the U.S. Food and Drug administration approved for commercialization a type of genetically engineered salmon, making it the first GMO (genetically modified organism) food animal to gain such approval. Van Eenennaam said that the regulatory evaluation process of this fast-growing fish took almost two decades and cost tens of millions of dollars, and yet fast-growing, conventionally bred salmon undergo no regulatory oversight despite posing similar risks.] GMO food animal regulation At the international level, an agreement called the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity is the main source of regulation for products of genetic engineering. Because the Cartagena Protocol s objective is  the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity,  it sets rules limiting the trade and transport of living modified plants and animals that might adversely affect biodiversity or human health. The protocol narrowly defines modified organisms to be only those produced by modern technology. However, plants and animals can be modified through other methods and not face regulatory limitations. Sleeping sickness case study Human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is a widespread and often fatal tropical disease caused by blood parasites and transmitted by tsetse flies. Some 60 million people in 36 African countries are at risk of contracting the disease, and a related animal form of the disease causes $1 billion annually in livestock losses in Africa. Sleeping sickness offers a prime example of regulatory inconsistencies, according to Van Eenennaam A variety of techniques are being used to prevent the disease, including insecticide applications, release of irradiation-induced sterile insects, drug treatments for livestock, and recombinant DNA technology.  Despite the fact that all of these approaches are associated with potential harms and potential benefits, only those that involve the use of modern biotechnology through recombinant DNA are subject to exceptional regulatory requirements,  Van Eenennaam says. GMO plants adopted by 18 million farmers globally In contrast to the difficulties experienced in gaining approval for genetically engineered animals, genetically engineered plants, first developed in 1983, moved into the commercial market in less than a decade and many GMO crops are now grown and consumed globally.  Given the current and growing global need for animal-based food, it is becoming increasingly evident that new varieties of genetically improved livestock need to be evaluated according to their potential risks and benefits, not according to what specific breeding method was used to produce them,  Van Eenennaam says.","Published: November 24, 2015"

The system uses a technique called fluorescence lifetime imaging, which has applications in DNA sequencing and cancer diagnosis, among other things. So the new work could have implications for both biological research and clinical practice.  The theme of our work is to take the electronic and optical precision of this big expensive microscope and replace it with sophistication in mathematical modeling,  says Ayush Bhandari, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab and one of the system s developers.  We show that you can use something in consumer imaging, like the Microsoft Kinect, to do bioimaging in much the same way that the microscope is doing.  Bhandari is the first author on the paper, and he s joined by associate professor of media arts and sciences Ramesh Raskar and Christopher Barsi, a former research scientist in Raskar s group who now teaches physics at the Commonwealth School in Boston. Fluorescence lifetime imaging, as its name implies, depends on fluorescence, or the tendency of materials known as fluorophores to absorb light and then re-emit it a short time later. For a given fluorophore, interactions with other chemicals will shorten the interval between the absorption and emission of light in a predictable way. Measuring that interval   the  lifetime  of the fluorescence   in a biological sample treated with a fluorescent dye can reveal information about the sample s chemical composition. In traditional fluorescence lifetime imaging, the imaging system emits a burst of light, much of which is absorbed by the sample, and then measures how long it takes for returning light particles, or photons, to strike an array of detectors. To make the measurement as precise as possible, the light bursts are extremely short. The fluorescence lifetimes pertinent to biomedical imaging are in the nanosecond range. So traditional fluorescence lifetime imaging uses light bursts that last just picoseconds, or thousandths of nanoseconds. Blunt instrument Off-the-shelf depth sensors like the Kinect, however, use light bursts that last tens of nanoseconds. That s fine for their intended purpose: gauging objects  depth by measuring the time it takes light to reflect off of them and return to the sensor. But it would appear to be too coarse-grained for fluorescence lifetime imaging. The Media Lab researchers, however, extract additional information from the light signal by subjecting it to a Fourier transform. The Fourier transform is a technique for breaking signals   optical, electrical, or acoustical   into their constituent frequencies. A given signal, no matter how irregular, can be represented as the weighted sum of signals at many different frequencies, each of them perfectly regular. The Media Lab researchers represent the optical signal returning from the sample as the sum of 50 different frequencies. Some of those frequencies are higher than that of the signal itself, which is how they are able to recover information about fluorescence lifetimes shorter than the duration of the emitted burst of light. For each of those 50 frequencies, the researchers measure the difference in phase between the emitted signal and the returning signal. If an electromagnetic wave can be thought of as a regular up-and-down squiggle, phase is the degree of alignment between the troughs and crests of one wave and those of another. In fluorescence imaging, phase shift also carries information about the fluorescence lifetime. Not all of the light that strikes the biological sample is absorbed; some of it is reflected back. The MIT researchers  system takes the measurements of incoming light and fits them to a mathematical model of the overlapping intensity profiles of both reflected and re-emitted light. Once it s deduced the intensity profile of the reflected light, it can calculate the distance between the emitter and the sample. So unlike conventional fluorescence lifetime imaging, the researchers  approach doesn t require distance calibration. Sample size According to Bhandari, some of his colleagues were skeptical that the returning light signal contained enough information to produce accurate models of the intensity profiles.  They were not convinced that the precision of Kinect-like sensors is enough,  he says.  But lifetime and distance are two numbers. If you have two numbers, then 50 measurements is a lot. The desired information is two points, but the measurement is 50 points, so you have a ratio of one to 25. It s enough to give you the intuition that it should be workable.  The depth sensors that the researchers used in their experiments   the Kinect and others   had arrays of roughly 20,000 light detectors each, and the most accurate results came when the detector was 2.5 meters away from the biological sample. That setup doesn t afford the image resolution that existing fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopes do. But while denser arrays of detectors and optics that better control the emission and gathering of light would inflate the cost of the researchers  system beyond the $100 that a Kinect costs, it still shouldn t be nearly as expensive as current fluorescence lifetime imaging systems.  If I had one of these devices, what I would do is just go looking around the world at stuff,  says Adam Cohen, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology and of physics at Harvard University.  There might be all sorts of interesting things. It s a new modality for looking around the world. It s just like, humans can t see polarization in the light   we only see color   and there s all this structure that insects can see because they can see polarization that we re just blind to. To my knowledge, there s no living organism that can see excited-state lifetime, and so there s this contrast modality that has not been explored by life that nonetheless might be very interesting. So I d look at it. ","Published: November 24, 2015"

The screening method suggests which commonly prescribed multiple myeloma drug, or combination of drugs, a physician should consider first for a particular patient. The test also suggests optimum dosage. The method also is being evaluated in a clinical trial involving patients with multiple myeloma. The results will indicate if the method is more effective than current screening methods.  Even before the patient completes all of the MRIs, CT scans and other imaging procedures following diagnosis, we can have a recommendation for which drug and dosage to prescribe,  said Kareem Azab, PhD, an assistant professor of radiation oncology at the School of Medicine and the Siteman Cancer Center member who leads the research.  The test results come in three to four days.  Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the infection-fighting plasma cells, part of the immune system found mainly in bone marrow. This year, an estimated 26,850 U.S. residents will be diagnosed with the disease and about 11,240 patients are expected to die, according to the American Cancer Society. Half of multiple myeloma patients diagnosed in the earliest stage of the disease don t survive beyond about five years after initial treatment because the cancer becomes resistant to treatments. Treating multiple myeloma is difficult because in 90 percent of cases there is no obvious genetic mutation that can be targeted with treatment. Also, standard drug screening methods don t adequately re-create the environment surrounding cancer cells growing in a particular patient s body, making those methods less reliable at predicting effective drug therapies. Azab hopes a more personalized approach will improve long-term patient outcomes. The method relies on 3-D tissue-engineered bone marrow (3DTEBM) cultures that Azab and his colleagues developed using myeloma patients  bone marrow samples. To more closely mimic outside the body what goes on within, scientists take small samples of a patient s cells   cancerous and benign   and remodel them in the lab. This tumor  microenvironment  includes the cancer cells and other neighboring blood vessels, immune cells and other components whose interaction can help or inhibit the tumor cells  growth. Drugs then are tested on the remodeled patient cells to determine which treatment is likely to be most effective. Azab s method gauges the sensitivity of a patient s cells to different drugs at any time in the course of the disease. Therefore, as a patient s multiple myeloma becomes more resistant to particular drugs, continued drug screening could suggest when to change therapies. This could save valuable time, he said.  Now we have a drug test that closely replicates what s going on with a patient at any given moment,  Azab said.  We think this method has a better chance of working than existing options.  Azab and his colleagues have launched a company, Cellatrix, in coordination with Washington University s Office of Technology Management and BioGenerator, a nonprofit organization that helps area bioscience companies form. Others have taken notice of the testing method and its potential. Later this year, Cellatrix will begin testing potential therapies on behalf of pharmaceutical companies. Azab s team also is studying how well the screening method works for patients with leukemia or lymphoma, which are cancers of the blood.","Published: November 24, 2015"

Until recently, scientists could try to understand the way humans adapted genetically to changes that occurred thousands of years ago only by looking at DNA variation in today s populations. But our modern genomes contain mere echoes of the past that can t be connected to specific events. Now, an international team reports  that researchers can see how natural selection happened by analyzing ancient human DNA.  It allows us to put a time and date on selection and to directly associate selection with specific environmental changes, in this case the development of agriculture and the expansion of the first farmers into Europe,  said Iain Mathieson, a research fellow in genetics at Harvard Medical School and first author of the study. By taking advantage of better DNA extraction techniques and amassing what is to date the largest collection of genome-wide datasets from ancient human remains, the team was able to identify specific genes that changed during and after the transition from hunting and gathering to farming. Many of the variants occurred on or near genes that have been associated with height, the ability to digest lactose in adulthood, fatty acid metabolism, vitamin D levels, light skin pigmentation and blue eye color. Two variants appear on genes that have been linked to higher risk of celiac disease but that may have been important in adapting to an early agricultural diet. Other variants were located on immune-associated genes, which made sense because  the Neolithic period involved an increase in population density, with people living close to one another and to domesticated animals,  said Wolfgang Haak, one of three senior authors of the study, a research fellow at the University of Adelaide and group leader in molecular anthropology at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History.  Although that finding did not come fully as a surprise,  he added,  it was great to see the selection happening in  real time.  The work also supports the idea that Europe s first farmers came from ancient Anatolia, in what is now Turkey, and fills in more details about how ancient groups mixed and migrated.  It s a great mystery how present-day populations got to be the way we are today, both in terms of how our ancestors moved around and intermingled and how populations developed the adaptations that help us survive a bit better in the different environments in which we live,  said co-senior author David Reich, professor of genetics at HMS.  Now that ancient DNA is available at the genome-wide scale and in large sample sizes, we have an extraordinary new instrument for studying these questions.   From an archaeological perspective, it s quite amazing,  said co-senior author Ron Pinhasi, associate professor of archaeology at University College Dublin.  The Neolithic revolution is perhaps the most important transition in human prehistory. We now have proof that people did actually go from Anatolia into Europe and brought farming with them. For more than 40 years, people thought it was impossible to answer that question.   Second,  he continued,  we now have evidence that genetic selection occurred along with the changes in lifestyle and demography, and that selection continued to happen following the transition.  Prying more from the past Members of the current team and others have used ancient DNA in the past few years to learn about Neanderthals and the genes they passed to humans, identify ancestors of present-day Europeans, trace migrations into the Americas and probe the roots of Indo-European languages. Studying natural selection, however, remained out of reach because it required more ancient genomes than were available.  In the past year, we ve had a super-exponential rise in the number of ancient samples we can study on a genome scale,  said Reich, who is also an associate member of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and a Howard Hughes Medical Investigator.  In September 2014, we had 10 individuals. In this study, we have 230.  The DNA came from the remains of people who lived between 3,000 and 8,500 years ago at different sites across what is now Europe, Siberia and Turkey. That time span provided snapshots of genetic variation before, during and after the agricultural revolution in Europe. Among the 230 ancient individuals were 83 who hadn t been sequenced before, including the first 26 to be gathered from the eastern Mediterranean, where warm conditions usually cause DNA to degrade. A petrous bone like those used in the study. Image: Rick GroleauMembers of the team used several technological advances to obtain and analyze the new genetic material. For example, they exploited a method pioneered by Pinhasi s laboratory to extract DNA from a remarkably rich source: a portion of the dense, pyramid-shaped petrous bone that houses the internal auditory organs. In some cases, the bone yielded 700 times more human DNA than could be obtained from other bones, including teeth.  That changed everything,  said Pinhasi.  Higher-quality DNA meant we could analyze many more positions on the genome, perform more complex tests and simulations, and start systematically studying allele frequency across populations.  What made the cut Although the authors caution that sample size remains the biggest limitation of the study, comparing the ancient genomes to one another and to those of present-day people of European ancestry revealed 12 positions on the genome where natural selection related to the introduction of farming in northern latitudes appears to have happened.  Some of those specific traits have been studied before,  said Reich.  This work with ancient DNA enriches our understanding of those traits and when they appeared.  Besides the adaptations that appear to be related to diet, pigmentation, immunity and height, the possible selective pressure on other variants was less clear.  We can guess by looking at the function of the gene, but our power is limited,  said Mathieson.  It s quite frustrating.  It s too early to tell whether some of the variants were themselves selected for or whether they hitched a ride with a nearby beneficial gene. The question pertains especially to variants that seem to be disadvantageous, like increased disease risk. Being able to look at numerous positions across the genome also allowed the team to examine complex traits for the first time in ancient DNA.  We can see the evolution of height across time,  said Mathieson. Researchers had noticed that people from southern Europe tend to be shorter than those from northern Europe. The new study suggests that the height differential arises both from people in the north having more ancestry from Eurasian steppe populations, who seem to have been taller, and people in the south having more ancestry from Neolithic and Chalcolithic groups from the Iberian peninsula, who seem to have been shorter. The team wasn t able to draw conclusions about the other complex traits it investigated: body mass index, waist-hip ratio, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and lipid levels. Reich, for one, hopes researchers will one day have thousands of ancient genomes to analyze. He would also like to see this type of study applied to non-European populations and even to other species.  It will be interesting to study selection in domesticated animals and to see if there is coevolution between them and the people who were domesticating them,  said Mathieson.","Published: November 24, 2015"

But now scientists from the Department of Zoology have demonstrated through mathematical modelling that the secret is migration, whereby movement between communities of microbes greatly increases the chances of different species of bacteria being able to swap DNA and adopt new traits. The study sheds new light on how the spread of traits such as antibiotic resistance is able to happen. Kevin Foster, Professor of Evolutionary Biology at Oxford University and principal investigator of the project, said: 'It is well known that bacteria are able to swap little pieces of DNA, which is crucial for them to be able to evolve and adapt to new environments, including responding to antibiotics. It's different to sex in humans, but the effect   swapping genetic material   is similar. 'However, sex in bacteria is a very rare event, with only one cell among millions swapping DNA. And in theory, any resistant strain will rapidly divide and take over the community, shutting down any opportunity to share the resistance gene with others. 'But it does keep happening, and genes are often able to hop through diverse groups of different bacteria. Until now, the mystery has been why.' Ren  Niehus, a DPhil student in the Department of Zoology and lead author of the paper, added: 'Our model investigates the conditions necessary for this bacterial sex to keep taking place   how does a function like antibiotic resistance keep hopping between bacteria? 'What we found was that the missing ingredient was migration. Previous work ignored that these communities are open, and our model shows that this very high immigration rate among bacteria gives a huge opportunity for different microbes to meet and swap DNA, even though it s a rare event when taken in isolation.' This migration between communities of bacteria can take place anywhere, from the human body to soil. And while antibiotic resistance is a good example of a beneficial trait passed horizontally between microbes, it could also involve being able to survive in an environmental toxin or on a particular nutrient.

The transaction represents more than a 30 percent premium based on Pfizer s and Allergan s unaffected share prices as of October 28, 2015. Allergan shareholders will receive 11.3 shares of the combined company for each of their Allergan shares, and Pfizer stockholders will receive one share of the combined company for each of their Pfizer shares.  The proposed combination of Pfizer and Allergan will create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world,  stated Ian Read, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer.  Allergan s businesses align with and enhance Pfizer s businesses, creating best-in-class, sustainable, innovative and established businesses that are poised for growth. Through this combination, Pfizer will have greater financial flexibility that will facilitate our continued discovery and development of new innovative medicines for patients, direct return of capital to shareholders, and continued investment in the United States, while also enabling our pursuit of business development opportunities on a more competitive footing within our industry.   The combination of Allergan and Pfizer is a highly strategic, value-enhancing transaction that brings together two biopharma powerhouses to change lives for the better,  said Brent Saunders, Chief Executive Officer, Allergan.  This bold action is the next chapter in the successful transformation of Allergan allowing us to operate with greater resources at a much bigger scale. Joining forces with Pfizer matches our leading products in seven high growth therapeutic areas and our robust R&D pipeline with Pfizer s leading innovative and established businesses, vast global footprint and strength in discovery and development research to create a new biopharma leader.  Under the terms of the proposed transaction, the businesses of Pfizer and Allergan will be combined under Allergan plc, which will be renamed  Pfizer plc.  The companies expect that shares of the combined company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trade under the  PFE  ticker. Upon the closing of the transaction, the combined company is expected to maintain Allergan s Irish legal domicile. Pfizer plc will have its global operational headquarters in New Yorkand its principal executive offices in Ireland. Pfizer s innovative businesses will be significantly enhanced by the addition of a growing revenue stream from Allergan s durable and innovative flagship brands in desirable therapeutic areas such as Aesthetics and Dermatology, Eye Care, Gastrointestinal, Neuroscience and Urology. The combined company will benefit from a broader innovative portfolio of leading medicines in key categories and a platform for sustainable growth with diversified payer groups. With the addition of Allergan, Pfizer will enhance its R&D capabilities in both new molecular entities and product line extensions. A combined pipeline of more than 100 mid-to-late stage programs in development and greater resources to invest in R&D and manufacturing is expected to sustain the growth of the innovative business over the long term. Through product approvals, launches and inline performance the combined company aspires to be a leader in growth. The combination of Pfizer and Allergan will significantly increase the scale of Pfizer s established business, and their complementary capabilities will maximize the combined established portfolio. The addition of Allergan s Women s Health and Anti-Infectives portfolio will add depth to Pfizer s established business, and Pfizer will expand the reach of Allergan s established portfolio using its existing commercial capabilities, infrastructure and global scale. In addition, Allerganbrings topical formulation, manufacturing and its Anda distribution capabilities to the combined company.

Polymyxins are the last line of defence antibiotic for patients in intensive care units, so it will be very dangerous if people stop responding to this treatment,  Professor Paterson said.  A key part of many intensive treatments relies on antibiotic success to fight life-threatening infection and keep further infections at bay.  However, resistance to this antibiotic is now becoming widespread in chickens, pigs and other animals across Asia, and has now been detected in humans.   Professor Paterson has said the resistance was directly linked to agricultural use of the antibiotic in the food-chain.  When humans eat the food derived from these animals fed with antibiotics, this leads to antibiotic resistance,  Professor Paterson said.  By the end of 2015, China is projected to use thousands of tonnes of polymyxins.  Chinese leaders needed to take urgent and decisive action to curb this use.  The diminishing effectiveness of antibiotics is a major concern worldwide, making it much harder to treat superbugs.  It also jeopardises the use of antibiotics to prevent the risk of infection associated with common medical procedures, including cancer treatment, organ transplant and surgery.  It is important to remember that antibiotics are a precious resource and should be used judiciously.  Dr Patrick Harris, an infectious disease physician, said a failure to act could lead to serious health problems.  The only way to stop this problem is to stop the antibiotic use in animals otherwise we risk a major public health catastrophe.""","Published: November 24, 2015"

The trial, conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) compared Lucentis with a type of laser therapy called panretinal or scatter photocoagulation, which has remained the gold standard for proliferative diabetic retinopathy since the mid-1970s. The findings demonstrate the first major therapy advance in nearly 40 years.  These latest results from the DRCR Network provide crucial evidence for a safe and effective alternative to laser therapy against proliferative diabetic retinopathy,  said Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D., director of NIH s National Eye Institute (NEI), which funded the trial. The results were published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Treating abnormal retinal blood vessels with laser therapy became the standard treatment for proliferative diabetic retinopathy after the NEI announced results of the Diabetic Retinopathy Study in 1976. Although laser therapy effectively preserves central vision, it can damage night and side vision; so, researchers have sought therapies that work as well or better than laser but without such side effects. A complication of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy can damage blood vessels in the light-sensitive retina in the back of the eye. As the disease worsens, blood vessels may swell, become distorted and lose their ability to function properly. Diabetic retinopathy becomes proliferative when lack of blood flow in the retina increases production of a substance called vascular endothelial growth factor, which can stimulate the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels. These new vessels are prone to bleeding into the center of the eye, often requiring a surgical procedure called a vitrectomy to clear the blood. The abnormal blood vessels can also cause scarring and retinal detachment. Lucentis is among several drugs that block the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor. About 7.7 million U.S. residents have diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness among working-age Americans. Among these, about 1.5 percent have PDR. The DRCR.net enrolled 305 participants (394 eyes) with proliferative diabetic retinopathy in one or both eyes at 55 clinical sites across the country. Eyes were assigned randomly to treatment with Lucentis or laser. For participants who enrolled both eyes in the study, one eye was assigned to the laser group and the other was assigned to the Lucentis group. About half of the eyes assigned to the laser group required more than one round of laser treatment. In the other group, Lucentis (0.5 mg/0.05 ml) was given via injections into the eye once per month for three consecutive months, and then as needed until the disease resolved or stabilized. Because Lucentis is commonly used to treat diabetic macular edema the build-up of fluid in the central area of the retina the study permitted the use of Lucentis for diabetic macular edema in the laser group, if necessary. Slightly more than half (53 percent) of eyes in the laser group received Lucentis injections to treat diabetic macular edema. About 6 percent of eyes in the Lucentis group received laser therapy, mostly to treat retinal detachment or bleeding. At two years, vision in the Lucentis group improved by about half a line on an eye chart compared with virtually no change in the laser group. There was little change in side vision with injection (average worsening of 23 decibels) but a substantial loss of side vision with laser (average worsening of 422 decibels). The vitrectomy rate was lower in the Lucentis group (8 of 191 eyes) than in the laser group (30 of 203 eyes). Rates of serious systemic adverse events, including cardiac arrest and stroke, were similar between the two groups. One patient in the Lucentis group developed endophthalmitis, an infection in the eye. Other side effects were low, with little difference between treatment groups.  Lucentis should be considered a viable treatment option for people with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, especially for individuals needing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for diabetic macular edema,  said Jeffrey G. Gross, M.D., of the Carolina Retina Center in Columbia, South Carolina, who chaired the study. Dr. Gross presented results November 13, 2015, at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology in Las Vegas. In addition to treating proliferative diabetic retinopathy, the report suggests Lucentis may even help prevent diabetic macular edema from occurring. Among people without diabetic macular edema at the start of the study, only 9 percent of Lucentis-treated eyes developed diabetic macular edema during the study, compared with 28 percent in the laser group. The DRCR.net will continue to follow patients in this study for a total of five years. The DRCR.net is dedicated to facilitating multicenter clinical research of diabetic eye disease. The network formed in 2002 and comprises more than 350 physicians practicing at more than 140 clinical sites across the country.","Published: November 24, 2015"

""We had no idea that an animal genome could be composed of so much foreign DNA,"" said co-author Bob Goldstein, faculty in the biology department in UNC's College of Arts and Sciences. ""We knew many animals acquire foreign genes, but we had no idea that it happens to this degree."" The work, publish today in the Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences, not only raises the question of whether there is a connection between foreign DNA and the ability to survive extreme environments, but further stretches conventional views of how DNA is inherited. First author Thomas Boothby, Goldstein and their collaborators revealed that tardigrades acquire about 6,000 foreign genes primarily from bacteria, but also from plants, fungi and Archaea, through a process called horizontal gene transfer - the swapping of genetic material between species as opposed to inheriting DNA exclusively from mom and dad. Previously another microscopic animal called the rotifer was the record-holder for having the most foreign DNA, but it has about half as much as the tardigrade. For comparison, most animals have less than one percent of their genome from foreign DNA. ""Animals that can survive extreme stresses may be particularly prone to acquiring foreign genes -- and bacterial genes might be better able to withstand stresses than animal ones,"" said Boothby, a postdoctoral fellow in Goldstein's lab. After all, bacteria have survived the Earth's most extreme environments for billions of years. The team speculates that the DNA is getting into the genome randomly but what is being kept is what allows tardigrades to survive the harshest of environments, e.g. stick a tardigrade in a - 80 celsius freezer for a year or 10 and it starts running around in 20 minutes after thawing. This is what the team thinks happens: when tardigrades are under conditions of extreme stress such as desiccation - or a state of extreme dryness -- Boothby and Goldstein believe that the tardigrade's DNA breaks into tiny pieces. When the cell rehydrates, the cell's membrane and nucleus, where the DNA resides, becomes temporarily leaky and DNA and other large molecules can pass through easily. Tardigrades not only can repair their own damaged DNA as the cell rehydrates but also stitch in the foreign DNA in the process, creating a mosaic of genes that come from different species. ""We think of the tree of life, with genetic material passing vertically from mom and dad,"" said Boothby. ""But with horizontal gene transfer becoming more widely accepted and more well known, at least in certain organisms, it is beginning to change the way we think about evolution and inheritance of genetic material and the stability of genomes. So instead of thinking of the tree of life, we can think about the web of life and genetic material crossing from branch to branch. So it's exciting. We are beginning to adjust our understanding of how evolution works.""","Published: November 24, 2015"

LAMP is a type of DNA amplification that does not use heat, but rather travels in a loop. Boyle is an internationally recognized expert on Strangles who has been conducting research on the disease for more than 10 years. Her work is focused on ways to improve the sensitivity of diagnostic tests to detect the bacteria that cause this highly contagious, upper respiratory disease. Strangles is caused by Streptococcus equi bacteria, related to the bacteria that cause strep throat in humans. Symptoms include nasal discharge, lethargy, and very high fever (over 103 degrees) in horses. The lymph nodes can swell to the point of cutting off the airway, thus the name Strangles. If the infected lymph nodes break open in the throat, the puss can collect in the guttural pouch, an air-filled structure within the horse's head that arises from the Eustachian tube on each side, Boyle said. Once in the guttural pouch, the bacteria can be very difficult to eradicate. Typically it takes two months to clear up an outbreak, Boyle said, and it can easily last for four months. Boyle s goal is to significantly reduce the time, effort, and expense required to test horses for Strangles. Through her research, she is working toward a highly accurate stall-side test. The current recommendation, now 10 years old, is to get a wash of the throat and obtain negative tests three times, each a week apart, to safely declare a horse clear of the infection. Until a barn is cleared, horses suspected of infection must be quarantined, and biosecurity protocols should be followed to prevent the spread of the disease, which can come at great expense and inconvenience to horse owners.  We are working to avoid going to farms three separate times in three separate weeks,  said Boyle, who is an assistant professor and board-certified clinician in Internal Medicine. It is important to determine which horses are carriers, which horses are not carriers, and which horses have come in contact with the bacteria and are immune, but have become carriers, Boyle said.  Our recommendation is to go into the guttural pouch for the sample to determine if they are carriers.  Boyle presented the abstract of her research earlier this year, titled  Determining Optimal Sampling Site for Streptococcus equi Subspecies Equine Carriers Using a Loop-Mediated Isothermal PCR Assay,  at the Havemeyer Foundation workshop on streptococcal disease in Denmark, and at the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine Conference in Indianapolis. Boyle worked with a team of veterinarians, including Dr. Shelley Rankin, Associate Professor of Microbiology at Penn Vet. The team tested the hypothesis that samples obtained from the equine guttural pouch would be more sensitive than samples obtained from the nasopharynx to identify carriers of Streptococcus equi. In addition, they hypothesized that a PCR test using LAMP technology would be more sensitive than a real-time PCR test. A total of 123 samples were collected from 40 horses. The horses were sampled in three different ways: nasopharyngeal flocked nylon swab (41 samples), nasopharyngeal wash (38 samples), and endoscopically guided guttural pouch lavage (44 samples). The LAMP test   which does not require heat cycling and is successfully used in human medicine   was performed on each. The guttural pouch lavage samples were tested using three different technologies: LAMP, realtime PCR, and the traditional culture.  Guttural pouch lavage was the best sample to detect carriers,  the report stated.","Published: November 24, 2015"

They also report on the promising results from tests of the sensor's ability to identify pancreatic cancer or indicate the existence of a benign condition by quantifying changes in levels of microRNA signatures linked to pancreatic cancer. MicroRNAs are small molecules of RNA that regulate how larger RNA molecules lead to protein expression. As such, microRNAs are very important in biology and disease states.  ""We used the fundamental concepts of nanotechnology to design the sensor to detect and quantify biomolecules at very low concentrations,"" said Rajesh Sardar, who developed the sensor. ""We have designed an ultrasensitive technique so that we can see minute changes in microRNA concentrations in a patient's blood and confirm the presence of pancreatic cancer."" Sardar is an assistant professor of chemistry and chemical biology in the School of Science at IUPUI and leads an interdisciplinary research program focusing on the intersection of analytical chemistry and the nanoscience of metallic nanoparticles. ""If we can establish that there is cancer in the pancreas because the sensor detects high levels of microRNA-10b or one of the other microRNAs associated with that specific cancer, we may be able to treat it sooner,"" said Dr. Murray Korc, the Myles Brand Professor of Cancer Research at the IU School of Medicine and a researcher at the IU Simon Cancer Center. Korc worked with Sardar to improve the sensor's capabilities and led the testing of the sensor and its clinical uses as well as advancing the understanding of pancreatic cancer biology. ""That's especially significant for pancreatic cancer, because for many patients it is symptom-free for years or even a decade or more, by which time it has spread to other organs, when surgical removal is no longer possible and therapeutic options are limited,"" said Korc. ""For example, diagnosis of pancreatic cancer at an early stage of the disease followed by surgical removal is associated with a 40 percent five-year survival. Diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic cancer, by contrast, is associated with life expectancy that is often only a year or less. ""The beauty of the sensor designed by Dr. Sardar is its ability to accurately detect mild increases in microRNA levels, which could allow for early cancer diagnosis,"" Korc added. Over the past decade, studies have shown that microRNAs play important roles in cancer and other diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. The new IUPUI nanotechnology-based sensor can detect changes in any of these microRNAs. The sensor is a small glass chip that contains triangular-shaped gold nanoparticles called ""nanoprisms."" After dipping it in a sample of blood or another body fluid, the scientist measures the change in the nanoprisms' optical property to determine the levels of specific microRNAs. ""Using gold nanoprisms may sound expensive, but because these particles are so very tiny, it really isn't,"" Sardar said.  It's actually a rather cheap technique because it uses nanotechnology and needs very little gold: $250 worth of gold makes 4,000 sensors. Having 4,000 sensors allows you to do at least 4,000 tests. The low cost makes this technique ideal for use anywhere, including in low-resource environments in this country and around the world."" The Indiana University Research and Technology Corporation has filed a patent application on Sardar's and Korc's groundbreaking nanotechnology-enabled sensor. The researchers' ultimate goal is to design ultrasensitive and extremely selective low-cost point-of-care diagnostics, enabling individual therapeutic approaches to diseases. Currently, polymerase chain reaction technology is used to determine microRNA signatures, which requires extraction of the microRNA from blood or other biological fluid and reverse transcription or amplification of the microRNA. PCR provides relative values. By contrast, the process developed at IUPUI is simpler, quantitative, more sensitive and highly specific even when two different microRNAs vary in a single position. The study demonstrated that the IUPUI nanotechnology-enabled sensor is as good as, if not better than, the most advanced PCR in detection and quantification of microRNA.","Published: November 24, 2015"

CIRCLE will evaluate JETREA  for the treatment of patients with moderately to very severe NPDR and its potential to reduce their risk of progression to Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR). The phase II study will be conducted in clinical sites in the United States as well as in several European countries. ThromboGenics and its clinical advisors believe that by using JETREA  to generate a PVD, the development of PDR and its sequelae may be prevented. PVD induction eliminates the scaffold for which new blood vessels may bleed into the vitreous. This belief is reinforced by the fact that the complications of PDR are less in patients who have a PVD. A recent report from the American Academy of Ophthalmology has projected that the prevalence of individuals with vision threatening diabetic retinopathy in the United States will be around 1.34 million persons by 2020. ThromboGenics remains on track to recruit the first patient in the United States around year-end 2015.

The technique relies on observation of the behavior of optical isomers. Molecules with the same composition that are mirror images of each other are optical isomers. For example, the building blocks of all living organisms, amino acids, are a single optical isomer. In our bodies, optical isomers bring different physiological changes due to their distinct optical activities. Therefore, controlling and analyzing the optical activities are critical when developing a new drug. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is the de facto standard of analyzing the optical activity of a compound. However, HPLC is very expensive that many laboratories can t afford to have. In addition, with the machine, one analysis may take 30 minutes to one hour to complete. It lacks in signal sensitivity and chemical decomposition, and the application is limited to nonpolar compounds. Usually adopted in analyzing the structure of a chemical compound, NMR spectroscopy requires only one to five minutes per single analysis. Since it is essential for analyzing the molecular structure, many chemistry labs have NMR equipment. However, until this technique was invented, no other research team had reported an effective way of using the NMR spectroscopy to decompose the signal of chiral activity of a compound. The research team uses negatively-charged metal compounds in NMR spectroscopy. The technique employs negatively-charged metal compounds which bond ionically to positively- and negatively-charged optical compounds. As a result, the NMR spectroscopy can distinguish the signal from chiral activity. Not only can it analyze various chemicals without structural constraints, but it can also be used for both nonpolar and polar solvents. As many compounds for new drugs have functional groups, which can be charged, this analysis method can be directly employed in the development process of drugs. Professor Kim said,  A revolutionary analysis method has been developed using simple chemical principles. I hope that our method will be applied to the development of new medicine.

The finished Erdosteine product is manufactured by Daewoong Pharmaceutical at its Korean facilities. Under the terms of the new agreement, Daewoong will annually purchase minimum API quantities of Erdosteine worth a total of about  25 million from Edmond Pharma, a Recipharm Group company. In return, Daewoong has secured exclusive rights in Korea and Thailand to sell both the original product and to register and market all the new formulations, based on Erdosteine, which are currently under development at Edmond Pharma. The first licensing agreement between Edmond Pharma and Daewoong Pharmaceutical was signed in 1994. As a consequence, Daewoong became Recipharm s exclusive partner in Korea and from 2008 for Thailand as well. The product has been sold under the name ERDOS in the Korean market ever since 1997. Erdosteine is indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic respiratory diseases. Its pharmacological profile is characterized by a unique multifactorial activity: muco-modulatory, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant. The molecule is marketed in over 40 countries and currently, 75% of Erdosteine sold worldwide is supplied by Edmond Pharma. Erdosteine is available in capsule, sachet, suspension and dispersible tablet formulations. The chemical synthesis of API to the manufacture of capsules and dispersible tablets is performed in Recipharm s Paderno Dugnano facility, located just outside of Milan. Pierfrancesco Manzo, Sales & Business Development Director for Erdosteine commented:  Daewoong Pharmaceutical is our first customer for the purchase of our Erdosteine API. We are therefore delighted to have secured this substantial extension of our contract with the company and believe strongly that this sets the basis for significant new growth of Erdosteine in Korea.  He continued:  Indeed, thanks to Daewoong s strong commitment on the scientific promotion of the product and our constant support in terms of clinical development, ERDOS has become a leading product in the Korean respiratory market with around 46 million capsules and 700 thousand suspensions sold in 2014 alone.

A new generation of specialized medicines based on small molecules requires novel manufacturing technologies and will be produced in lower volumes than traditional medicines. As a result, Roche plans to exit four manufacturing sites in Clarecastle, Ireland; Leganes, Spain; Segrate, Italy; and Florence, United States. In an effort to minimize job reductions, the company is actively looking into divestment opportunities for these facilities. In order to manufacture a new generation of specialized medicines based on small molecules, Roche will further invest 300 million Swiss francs into a dedicated facility in Kaiseraugst, Switzerland to support future technology requirements. This investment will strengthen the company s development and launch capabilities.  With these changes we are responding to the evolution of our small molecule portfolio towards specialized medicines produced in lower volumes,  says Daniel O Day, Chief Operating Officer, Pharmaceuticals Division of Roche.  We are aware of the impact this decision has on our colleagues, and we will do our utmost to support them during this transition.  Roche will immediately begin discussions with employee representatives in the respective countries, and will conduct the consultation process in an open and socially responsible manner. Transition will begin in 2016 and is planned to end by 2021. Affected employees will be notified as soon as possible and will receive appropriate support during the transition. It is expected that site exits will result in non-core restructuring costs of CHF 1.6 billion until 2021, of which up to CHF 600 million will be in cash. This also includes additional efficiency efforts undertaken in the manufacturing network and organization. Estimated non-core costs in 2015 are up to CHF 800 million, with only a minor cash flow impact in 2015. Roche continuously assesses and adapts its manufacturing capacities and technologies.

This work will allow Sheffield University to progress toxicology trials and prepare for Phase 1 clinical trials, with the help of the Medical Research Council (MRC): Developmental Pathway Funding Scheme (DPFS) provided by the UK Biomedical Catalyst. ProFuse Technology is a novel fusion technology in which hormones are fused to the extracellular domain of their receptors. The resulting fusion protein has a longer circulation half-life than the native hormone as it is larger in size, and is able to compete with the natural hormone for receptor binding. Cobra will be using its cell line development service, maxXpress, to produce the GH antagonist fusion protein. By disrupting GH binding and thus preventing the cellular changes normally initiated by the hormone, it is hoped that the protein will be successful in the treatment of patients suffering from Acromegaly, a condition of excessive body growth due to GH over-production. This condition results in increased morbidity and mortality. Peter Coleman, CEO Cobra Biologics commented:  I am very pleased that The University of Sheffield has chosen Cobra to manufacture the ProFuse growth hormone antagonist.

The new format, known as Neurodata Without Borders (NWB): Neurophysiology, is the first widely available format that allows researchers to capture and share data generated by two of the most widely used methods in brain research: optical and electrical neurophysiology. A description of the format and its potential impact on the field of neuroscience is published in the journal Neuron. ""A unified data format is prerequisite to really achieving breakthroughs in understanding the brain,"" said Fritz Sommer, a neuroscientist at the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience and Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California (UC), Berkeley, and senior author on the paper. ""It's hard to overstate the importance of new tools that will allow neuroscientists to share, search, analyze and integrate the large, complex data sets that are the product of modern neurophysiology experiments. The NWB format enables such tools to be developed."" New research approaches, developed in the last decade, are profoundly altering the way neuroscientists study the brain, a trend that is accelerating due to President Obama's Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative. Scientists can now ask questions about how the brain functions at the level of brain circuits and networks by recording the simultaneous activity of hundreds, even thousands, of brain cells in live animals. As a result, neuroscience data sets have become extremely large and complex capturing a suite of experimental different variables -- and it has become a major challenge to manage those data and extract meaning from them. ""It's of the utmost importance that neuroscience arrives at a standard, as other fields such as astronomy and genomics have, so that there's a way to compare and to contrast experimental data,"" said Christof Koch, President and Chief Scientific Officer of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle and one of the researchers who initiated the project. ""Our current tools generate an abundance of data in different formats that are not easily transcribed from one into the other, yielding a Tower of Babel situation. Thanks to NWB, we can now easily read and analyze data streaming in from different instruments to understand the underlying logic."" As the World Wide Web developed, software developers adopted standards for web pages so that they could be viewed consistently in different browsers. Similarly, the NWB format ensures that neuroscientists around the world can access, share, compare and analyze cellular-based neurophysiology data sets, which are essential to studying the connection between brain function and behavior. The NWB:Neurophysiology format expands neuroscientists' toolkit in two ways: First, it encodes both raw data and related metadata, which describe the experimental conditions under which the data were produced, for optical and electrical recordings of the brain in action. That combination is important because existing standards focus on electrical recordings, which limits the ability of neuroscientists to integrate their data. Second, it is extensible, therefore it can be modified to capture other types of neurophysiology data, such as imaging data. ""Currently, there are almost as many data formats as major neurophysiology laboratories. In addition to a common format, NWB:Neurophysiology also places a strong emphasis on providing sufficient metadata. Oftentimes it is impossible to figure out whether recordings were made from male or female animals, from the right or left hemisphere of the brain, or the time of recording, even in published papers. Information of this kind will be extremely valuable when meta-analyses on many data sets will be performed. Even if the NWB format changes over the years, the desire of an agreed format is made very clear by our effort,"" said Gy rgy Buzs ki of New York University and a scientific partner of the NWB:Neurophysiology project. The Neurodata Without Borders alliance launched in mid 2014 to break down the obstacles to data sharing. The NWB:Neurophysiology data format is the result of a dedicated, one-year pilot project. It was created by software developers and theoretical and experimental neuroscientists from UC Berkeley and the Allen Institute for Brain Science, Gy rgy Buzs ki of New York University, Markus Meister of the California Institute of Technology, and Karel Svoboda of the Janelia Research Campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). These scientific partners have publicly released multiple large, web-based data sets in the NWB:Neurophysiology format, including the Allen Institute's Cell Types Database, which contains detailed information about hundreds of individual cells in the mouse brain. ""I'm really proud of the fact that we have this format and that it was created in such a way that we can continue to build on it. It's much more than anything that we had before,"" said Chinh Dang, Chief Administrative Officer at the Allen Institute. The NWB team will continue to refine the data format and develop new analysis tools to maximize its usefulness, in partnership with the neuroscience community. ""Would it not be wonderful to have a 'Neurophysiology DropBox' into which investigators could simply drop their recordings and share with everyone? We are not there yet but the NWB program is steering us in that direction. Agreeing on a format facilitates this sender-receiver communication,"" said Buzs ki. ""Real understanding of the brain and its diseases can only come from the whole world being engaged in the challenge. The NWB format is a key step to enable collaborative research on the brain,"" said Linda Lanyon, Executive Director, and Sean Hill, Scientific Director, INCF. Funding and support for NWB:Neurophysiology was provided by the Allen Institute, GE Healthymagination, the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF), HHMI and The Kavli Foundation. ""We are delighted by the progress made by these outstanding researchers and we're confident that this new format will make a significant contribution to better understanding the brain,"" said Robert Wells, Executive Director for Strategy, GE Healthymagination. ""GE is proud to have been a supporter of this important initiative."" ""This is such an exciting time for brain research. But there are still hurdles to overcome to understand the brain. We hope that neuroscientists will embrace the NWB data standard and improve it so that the full impact of their creativity and ingenuity can be felt,"" said Miyoung Chun, Executive Vice President of Science Programs at The Kavli Foundation.

However, a new study carried out by researchers at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) suggests that this approach may be too simple. It appears that neighboring serotonin-producing brainstem regions exert different and sometimes opposing effects on behavior. The findings, published in the online edition of Cell Reports, provide new insights into the development of mood disorders and may aid in designing improved therapies.  Our study breaks with the simplistic view that  more is good and less is bad,  when it comes to serotonin for mood regulation,  said study leader Mark S. Ansorge, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry at CUMC and research scientist at New York State Psychiatric Institute.  Rather, it tells us that a more nuanced view is necessary.  From anatomical studies, researchers knew that the brainstem contains two distinct clusters of serotonergic neurons: one in dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and another in the median raphe nucleus (MRN). Together both regions harbor the vast majority of neurons that supply serotonin to the rest of the brain, but it was unclear how neuronal activity within these clusters controls behavior. To learn more, the CUMC team used a technique called pharmacogenetics to control the activity of serotonergic neurons in the DRN and MRN in both normal mice and in a mouse model of depression- and anxiety-like behavior. (The model was created by giving mice the drug fluoxetine shortly after birth, which produces long-lasting behavioral changes). The experiments revealed that alterations in serotonergic neuronal activity in the DRN and MRN produce markedly different behavioral consequences.  Going into the study, our hypothesis was that reduced activity of serotonergic neurons is what drives these mood behaviors,  said Dr. Ansorge.  But what we found was more complicated. First, it appears that hyperactivity of the MRN drives anxiety-like behavior. We also observed that decreased DRN activity increases depression-like behavior, while decreased MRN activity reduces it. This led us to conclude that an imbalance between DRN and MRN activity is what leads to depression-like behavior.   This new understanding of the raphe nuclei should help us better understand why certain medications are effective in treating depression and anxiety, and aid in designing new drugs,  Dr. Ansorge added.  In the future, it may be possible to find treatments that selectively target the DRN or the MRN, or that correct any imbalance between the two.  Jeffrey Lieberman, M.D., chair of the department of psychiatry at CUMC, observed that  Neurobiological studies such as this are essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of antidepressant treatments and to develop more effective therapies.  The study also demonstrated, in experiments using the fluoxetine-treated mice, that inhibition of serotonin reuptake early in life leads to long-lasting imbalances between the DRN and MRN.  This raises possible concerns about exposure to serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors during gestation,  said Dr. Ansorge.  SSRIs cross the blood-brain barrier as well as the placenta, and bind maternal and fetal serotonin transporters alike. It s too early to say whether this has any effect on behavior in humans, but it s certainly something worth looking into.  Columbia University Medical Center   press release Teissier A et al.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/infertile-worms-resist-infection-induced-neurodegeneration-283815,Infertile worms resist infection induced neurodegeneration Intriguing exception to pattern of infection leading to neuro disease  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Intriguing exception to pattern of infection leading to neuro-disease -The connections are still obscure, but mounting evidence points to a link between infections, the immune system, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer s, ALS, and Parkinson s. Now, a team of Duke University researchers has shown that infection with live, pathogenic bacteria causes neurodegeneration in the worm C. elegans. Infected worms display a number of changes that are hallmarks of neurodegeneration in aging humans and patients with illnesses such as Alzheimer s disease. The study, which appears in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, also yielded a big surprise: infertile animals appear to be protected from neurodegeneration.  In worms, there may be some type of signal from the sex cells or germline that plays a role in infection-induced neurodegeneration,  said Alejandro Aballay, PhD, senior study author and associate professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at Duke University School of Medicine.  That was definitely unexpected, though we know that infertility liberates energy that would have been spent on producing the germline and directs it toward tissue repair and other maintenance,  Aballay said.  It will be interesting to figure out how the response to pathogens fits into this scheme.  In recent years, researchers have begun to notice a problematic relationship between pathogens and neurodegeneration. Multiple studies have shown that patients living with chronic infections are particularly susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases. What appears to happen is microbes infect a patient, alerting the immune system and unleashing inflammation, which progressively destroys neurons. This unintended side effect does not benefit the microorganism, and it certainly doesn t benefit the host. Because it is so difficult to study this process in humans, Aballay s lab turned to the nematode worm, C. elegans, as a model. This 1-millimeter, transparent worm has a much simpler nervous system, consisting of only 302 neurons that represent most types of neurons in the mammalian brain. It also has a rudimentary immune system. In the laboratory, these worms typically inhabit Petri dishes covered in a lawn of E. coli bacteria, which the animals graze all day. To infect the worms, Aballay and his colleagues simply replaced the worm s typical chow with the common bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They also tagged the animals  neurons with a fluorescent label so the researchers could visualize any neurodegenerative changes associated with infection. The researchers witnessed a number of neural changes that are hallmarks of neurodegeneration. For example, they saw beaded neurons, nerve cells with little round outgrowths that give the appearance of beads. They also found areas where the neurons, which are normally straight like an arrow, were branched or wavy.   Neurons are designed to act like a straightforward superhighway that sends signals from one cell to another,  said Aballay.  These wavy neurons are more like a mountain route, where things go very slow and inefficiently because it turns and curves.  In humans, these changes would be accompanied by behavioral defects, perhaps making it harder to remember a name or where you put the car keys. In worms, the researchers found that these neural changes also had functional consequences. Normally, the animals would be able to sense and move toward their favorite treat salt but when their neurons were affected, so was their ability to respond to the stimulus. Next, the researchers wanted to determine if there were any genes that could protect against infection and neurodegeneration in worms. They mutated hundreds of worms, infected them with the same pathogen as before, and then looked to see if any were resistant to infection-induced neurodegeneration. The researchers found one particularly promising candidate, which contained a mutation in a gene called mes-1. Interestingly, all the worms with this mutation lacked the sex cells needed to produce offspring. In additional genetic studies, Aballay and his colleagues found that another gene called DAF-16 was required for resistance to neurodegeneration in these mutant animals. Its human equivalent, a gene called FOXO6, is known to function at the intersection of pathways controlling immunity, longevity and stress responses.  In the future, we plan to focus more on what is happening at the level of the neuron, to understand how the neuron senses pathogenic molecules or inflammatory cues, and how sensing those cues ultimately triggers neurodegeneration,  said Aballay.

The study, published in Neuron, shows that the formation of layers speeds the development of neuronal circuits although, surprisingly, it is not crucial for the establishment of functional and cell-type specific connections. Our brains contain billions of neurons connected by trillions of synapses. Despite this enormous complexity the pattern of connectivity in the brain is highly ordered and stereotyped across individuals of the same species. A common organizational feature of the brain is the arrangement of synaptic connections into layers. Why the brain organizes itself this way is not known. A clue to the significance of layers in the brain comes from the observation that synapses are not randomly distributed amongst different layers. Instead a particular layer will contain synapses between specific neuronal subtypes resulting in the formation of layers that contain synapses with similar functional properties. Thus, an attractive idea is that lamination of the brain during development is a necessary step in the development of synapses between specific neuronal subtypes, i.e. layers ensure that cell type A will only connect to cell type B and not to cell types C and D, for example. However, there is little experimental evidence demonstrating a role for layers in establishing cell type-specific connections between neurons. The researchers from the Department of Developmental Neurobiology, Nikolas Nikolaou and Martin Meyer, used the visual system of zebrafish as a model system to provide novel insights into the role of layers in the brain. The main visual area of the zebrafish brain, the optic tectum, receives input from the eye via the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). These axons are organized as a highly precise laminar array within the tectum. In zebrafish astray mutants, which carry a mutation in the robo2 gene, the layered arrangement of RGCs in the tectum is lost. The authors used the astray mutant to study how loss of a layered neural architecture impacts the functional development of connections between RGC axons and their target neurons in the tectum. The study focuses on the development of direction-selective circuits that enable the animal to tell which direction objects are moving in. A surprising finding of the study is that in relatively mature astray zebrafish larvae the functional properties of direction-selective circuits are identical to those seen in normal zebrafish. What's more, the authors found that RGC axons managed to connect with their intended target neurons in the astray mutant tectum. These findings indicate that the formation of layers is not necessary for establishing functional and cell-type specific connections. Furthermore it was found that the role of the robo2 gene was to guide the growth of not only RGC axons but also their target neurons to a common lamina. If layers are not ultimately required for the formation of functional neural circuits then what are they for? One idea is that by guiding the growth of matching neurons to a common layer, Robo2 facilitates contact between neurons. Such a mechanism would speed up the process of circuit assembly. To test this idea the authors performed the same set of experiments on much younger larval zebrafish. In these young animals there was a profound deficit in the development of direction-selective circuits. Collectively, these findings suggest that a layered neural architecture is ultimately dispensable for the correct wiring of circuits, but that lamination is essential for the rapid functional development of these neural networks. 'By showing that lamination speeds the functional development of circuits in the brain we have provided experimental evidence showing what layers are for. For larval zebrafish, which are crucially dependent on vision for survival, speed really matters,' said Nikolas Nikolaou the first author of the study. Martin Meyer, the senior author of the study, said, 'Our study also reveals how strikingly plastic and adaptable the developing brain is. The fact that neurons can eventually find one another and ultimately form functionally normal connections when lamination cues are lost was something that we had not expected. Perhaps by understanding such plasticity we can gain important insight into how to repair circuits that are damaged by trauma or disease.' King's College London  press release Nikolaou N, Meyer MP.

CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing activity runs continuously, though, leading to risk of additional editing at unwanted sites. Now, researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, Ludwig Cancer Research and Isis Pharmaceuticals demonstrate a commercially feasible way to use RNA to turn the CRISPR-Cas9 system on and off as desired   permanently editing a gene, but only temporarily activating CRISPR-Cas9.    These findings provide a platform for multiple therapeutic applications, especially for nervous system diseases, using successive application of designer CRISPR RNA drugs,  said senior author Don Cleveland, PhD, Distinguished Professor and Chair of the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine and head of Ludwig Cancer Research s Laboratory for Cell Biology.  CRISPR/Cas9 works like this: researchers design a  guide  RNA to match the sequence of a specific target gene. The RNA guides the Cas9 enzyme to the desired spot, where it cuts the DNA. The cell can repair the DNA break, but it does so imprecisely, thereby inactivating the gene. Alternatively, researchers can coax the cell into replacing the section adjacent to the cut with a healthier version of the gene. Researchers are now testing the CRISPR/Cas9 system in a variety of applications to repair defective genes that cause disease. The new approach introduces chemically modified, RNA-based drugs to transiently activate the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system. An initial, specially modified RNA is used to replace the usual guide RNA. This RNA directs Cas9 s DNA-cutting activity to a selected target gene and the editing process proceeds. Activity is transient, however, as the editing stops when the guiding RNA drug is cleared. An extension of the approach can switch off the molecular scissors even faster by addition of a second, chemically modified RNA drug that directs inactivation of the gene encoding the Cas9 enzyme.  The RNA-based drugs we developed in this study provide many advantages over the current CRISPR/Cas9 system, such as increased editing efficiency and potential selectivity,  said Cleveland.  In addition, they can be synthesized efficiently, on an industrial scale and in a commercially feasible manner today.   Today s published work is another demonstration of the successful synergy between Dr. Cleveland s lab and my team at Isis Pharmaceuticals,  said C. Frank Bennet, PhD, co-senior author of the study and senior vice president of research at Isis Pharmaceuticals.  Leveraging Isis  expertise in developing RNA-targeted compounds, together the team has demonstrated that we can develop molecules that enhance the effectiveness of the CRISPR mechanism.

They envision that synthetic gene drives designed using an RNA-guided gene editing system known as CRISPR-Cas9   which works like a pair of molecular scissors to precisely cut or edit DNA   could one day be used outside of the lab to prevent transmission of deadly insect and animal-borne diseases and eradicate invasive species that threaten the ecosystem and agriculture. Now a team led by Church and Esvelt at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University and Harvard Medical School (HMS) demonstrates effective safeguarding mechanisms for working with gene drives and unveils a first-of-its-kind method for reversing the changes they spread. ""Any claim of reversibility of modern technology requires strong evidence,"" said Church, who is a Wyss Core Faculty member, the Robert Winthrop Professor of Genetics at HMS, and Professor of Health Sciences and Technology at Harvard and MIT. ""This is a major step in that direction for the field of synthetic biology."" Alongside researchers on the Wyss Institute's Synthetic Biologyplatform, Church and Esvelt, who is a Wyss Technology Development Fellow, have led the gene drive research community in discussions about responsible laboratory conduct and proactive confinement guidelines for the safeguarding of gene drive research. Their latest study verifies the efficacy of safeguarding protocols developed by their team, such as increased and improved physical biocontainment barriers and the introduction of so-called ""molecular confinement"" mechanisms which use genetic engineering to block laboratory organisms from surviving and reproducing in the highly unlikely event they ever escaped into the ecosystem. ""The gene drive research community has been actively discussing what should be done to safeguard shared ecosystems, and now we have demonstrated that the proposed safeguards work extremely well and should therefore be used by every gene drive researcher in every relevant lab organism,"" said Esvelt. CRISPR gene drives work by using sequences of RNA to guide the gene-cutting Cas9 protein to a specific target gene for editing. The molecular confinement mechanisms developed by the team prevent gene drives from functioning in the wild by manipulating these biological components. By separating the guide RNA and the Cas9 protein so that they are not encoded together in the same organism, or by inserting an artificial sequence into the targeted gene, gene drives can only be activated in lab organisms and are therefore not able to function in the wild. ""Using yeast in the lab, we also showed that a trait imposed on a population using a gene drive could be reversed,"" said the paper's first co-first author James Dicarlo, a graduate research assistant at the Wyss Institute and HMS. The team notes that using this safeguard, essentially any population-level change mediated by a gene drive could be subsequently overwritten if the need ever arose. In such a case, the originally imposed trait would be reversed and the biological ""machinery"" of the CRISPR gene drive system   the guide RNAs and the Cas9 protein   would remain present, albeit rendered inactive, in the DNA of organisms. The reversibility mechanism isn't just a useful backup to have on hand in case a gene drive ever had an unexpected side-effect; the ability to impose or reverse gene drive effects could also one day prove useful for the management of disease transmitting organisms such as mosquitoes, invasive species, and crop-destroying insects. Although more research needs to be done in the lab before gene drives will ever potentially be ready for use outside of confined laboratory experiments, researchers now have the tools to perform those experiments safely. And in the meantime, gene drives themselves are useful lab tools for perturbing the genomes of lab organisms and unlocking new insights into the complex interplay of genes. ""Gene drive technology has great potential to solve global problems, such as malaria, for which we have no solutions today,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D, who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at HMS and Boston Children's Hospital and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. ""But the field needs to proactively develop safeguard mechanisms and reversibility capabilities to ensure the safety of this new technology and enable its enormous potential for doing good.

Now, researchers at Johns Hopkins report uncovering the role of an enzyme crucial to telomere length and say the new method they used to find it should speed discovery of other proteins and processes that determine telomere length.   We ve known for a long time that telomerase doesn t tell the whole story of why chromosomes  telomeres are a given length, but with the tools we had, it was difficult to figure out which proteins were responsible for getting telomerase to do its work,  says Carol Greider, Ph.D., the Daniel Nathans Professor and Director of Molecular Biology and Genetics in the Johns Hopkins Institute for Basic Biomedical Sciences. Greider won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of telomerase.  Figuring out exactly what s needed to lengthen telomeres has broad health implications, Greider notes, because shortened telomeres have been implicated in aging and in diseases as diverse as lung and bone marrow disorders, while overly long telomeres are linked to cancer. Because telomeres naturally shorten each time DNA is copied in preparation for cell division, cells need a well-tuned process to keep adding the right number of building blocks back onto telomeres over an organism s lifetime.  But until now researchers have been saddled with a limiting and time-consuming test for whether a given protein is involved in maintaining telomere length, a test that first requires blocking a suspected protein s action in lab-grown cells, then getting the cells to grow and divide for about three months so that detectable differences in telomere length can emerge. In addition to being time consuming, the test could not be used at all for proteins whose loss would kill the cells before the three-month mark. To find a better tool, graduate student Stella Suyong Lee, working in Greider s laboratory, started with a concept used for measuring telomere length in yeast. The idea was to artificially cut mammalian cells  telomeres, then detect elongation by telomerase   a test that would take less than a day, and could be performed even if the blocked proteins were needed for cells to divide. But making the transition from yeast to mammals involved a host of unforeseen technical difficulties, and the project took nearly five years. Greider credits Lee s persistence for its eventual success. For their trial run of the new test, dubbed addition of de novo initiated telomeres (ADDIT), Greider s group examined an enzyme called ATM kinase.  ATM kinase was known to be involved in DNA repair, but there were conflicting reports about whether it had a role in telomere lengthening,  says Greider. Her team blocked the enzyme in lab-grown mouse cells, and used ADDIT to find that it was indeed needed to lengthen telomeres. They verified the result using the old, three-month-long telomere test, and got the same result. The team also found that in normal mouse cells, a drug that blocks an enzyme called PARP1 would activate ATM kinase and spur telomere lengthening. This finding offers a proof of principle for drug-based telomere elongation to treat short-telomere diseases, such as bone marrow failure, Greider says   but she cautions that PARP1 inhibitor drug itself doesn t have the same telomere-elongating effect in human cells as it does in mouse cells. Greider s group plans to use ADDIT to find out more about the telomere-lengthening biochemical pathway that ATM kinase is a part of, as well as other pathways that help determine telomere length.  The potential applications are very exciting,  Lee says.  Ultimately ADDIT can help us understand how cells strike a balance between aging and the uncontrolled cell growth of cancer, which is very intriguing. ","Published: November 23, 2015"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/potential-persistent-tuberculosis-treatment-205721,Potential Persistent Tuberculosis Treatment Researchers have discovered several first in class compounds that targethidden TB infections by attacking a critical process the bacteria use to survive in the hostile environment of the lungs  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Tuberculosis has been infecting humans for several millennia, making it one of the most horribly successful diseases in history. Today, it is still a major killer, responsible for some 1.5 million deaths each year. In a substantial number of cases some two billion, in fact the tuberculosis bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) isn t active at all. Instead, it hides inside cell aggregates, latent and persistent, waiting to break out. Now, scientists from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have discovered several first-in-class compounds that target these hidden infections by attacking a critical process the bacteria use to survive in the hostile environment of the lungs. The study was led by Kate Carroll, a TSRI associate professor.  With the help of Scripps Florida s high-throughput screening facility, we looked at nearly 40,000 compounds before we uncovered these new, potent inhibitors that attack an enzyme critical to the survival of persistent tuberculosis,  Carroll said.  Thanks to our collaborators in India with access to drug-resistant patient isolates, we were able to demonstrate that these compounds also show excellent activity against multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains, in addition to the standard laboratory reference strain, H37Rv, of M. tuberculosis.  In 2013, the World Health Organization reported that nearly a quarter of all new and previously treated cases of the disease were multidrug resistant difficult to diagnose and even more difficult to treat. James Collins, who is the Termeer Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University, praised the new study, saying,  This is a marvelous work and an important contribution to the field.  A Promising New Target The study identified at least three different structural classes of compounds known as APSR inhibitors active against the bacteria, particularly those multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains. The APSR enzyme is essential to the production of reduced sulfur compounds needed to stabilize the cellular environment and the target of Carroll s new inhibitors, which aim to kill persistent tuberculosis by disrupting this balance.  M. tuberculosis infects host macrophages,  Carroll said.  These immune cells produce high levels of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (RONS), which cause oxidative damage to biomolecules, such as lipids, proteins and DNA. For this reason, M. tuberculosis depends heavily upon the production of RONS-neutralizing reduced sulfur compounds, including mycothiol and cysteine. This is why the reductive sulfur assimilation pathway is such a powerful target. Once you reduce the level of reduced sulfur compounds, you eliminate a central mechanism that all bacteria, including M. tuberculosis, use to survive host defense systems.  The new study may encourage exploration of this pathway as a target for development of other antibacterial treatments. ""The first-in-class inhibitors in our study satisfy many criteria expected of a lead scaffold for anti-tuberculosis therapeutics,  said Prakash Palde, the first author of the study and a research associate in the Carroll lab.  But the presence of APSR enzyme in other pathogenic bacteria also means our new inhibitors may have the potential to be developed in to a class of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/surprising-trait-found-in-antihiv-antibodies-210826,Surprising Trait Found in Anti HIV Antibodies Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute  TSRI  have new weapons in the fight against HIV  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Their new study describes four prototype antibodies that target a specific weak spot on the virus. Guided by these antibodies, the researchers then mimicked the molecular structure of a protein on HIV when designing their own potential HIV vaccine candidate.  This study is an example of how we can learn from natural infection and translate that information into vaccine development,  said TSRI Research Associate Raiees Andrabi.  This is an important advance in the field of antibody-based HIV vaccine development.  Andrabi served as first author of the study, working in the lab of senior author TSRI Professor Dennis R. Burton, who is also scientific director of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) Neutralizing Antibody Center and of the National Institutes of Health s Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery (CHAVI-ID) at TSRI. Surprising New Antibodies The findings build on the success of several recent TSRI studies showing that, with prompting, the immune system can develop antibodies to neutralize many strains of HIV. In the new study, the researchers carried out a series of experiments involving virus modifications, protein and antibody engineering. They found that four antibodies targeted a single spot on HIV s surface called the V2 apex. This was significant because the V2 apex could be recognized by these antibodies on about 90 percent of known HIV strains and even related strains that infect other species. A vaccine targeting this region could protect against many forms of the virus.  This region helps stabilize the virus, so it s an important area to target if you want to neutralize HIV,  said Andrabi. Investigating further, the researchers noticed that two of the four antibodies had an unusual feature that could prove important in vaccine design. The immune system usually begins its fight against infection by activating immune B cells that express  germline  forms of antibodies, on their surface, to bind invading pathogens. Germline antibodies rarely bind viruses very effectively themselves; instead, they are precursors for more developed antibodies, which mutate and hone their response to the invader. Yet in the new study, two of the antibodies did not need to mutate to bind with the V2 apex; instead, these antibodies used part of their basic germline structure, encoded by non-mutated genes. This means any patient with HIV should, in theory, have the ability to kick-start the right immune response. Unfortunately, the immune system seems to naturally produce only a small number of these HIV-neutralizing germline antibodies. To generate an immune response that would favor these antibodies, it was critical for the scientists to find the right proteins in HIV that the antibodies could recognize and bind to. In the new study, the researchers succeeded in mimicking a structure on HIV called the native HIV coat protein. This let them design proteins that do indeed bind well to the germline antibodies and hopefully start a useful immune response. The next step will be to test the vaccine candidates in animal models.","Published: November 23, 2015"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/novel-proteins-linked-to-huntingtons-disease-203886,Novel Proteins Linked to Huntington s Disease University of Florida Health researchers have made a new discovery about Huntington s disease  showing that the gene that causes the fatal disorder makes an unexpected  cocktail  of mutant proteins that accumulate in the brain  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The findings are significant because these newly identified mutant proteins kill neurons and build up in regions of the brain that are most affected by the disease, said Laura Ranum, Ph.D., director of the UF Center for NeuroGenetics and a professor in the UF College of Medicine department of molecular genetics and microbiology.  ""We have to get to the bottom of why these junk proteins accumulate in the brain and we need to figure out how to block that process,"" Ranum said. Huntington's disease is an inherited disorder that damages nerve cells and causes parts of the brain to deteriorate, leading to uncontrolled movements and behavioral and cognitive problems. There is no cure and no way to stop the disease's progression, though medications can treat some symptoms. About 30,000 people in the United States have the disorder and another 200,000 are at risk of inheriting it, according to the Huntington's Disease Society of America. The researchers examined the brains of 12 deceased adult and juvenile patients with Huntington's disease. They found novel proteins that were abundant in areas of patients' brains that showed cell death, neuronal loss and other signs of disease, including neuroinflammation. Along with a protein already implicated in Huntington's disease, the researchers found four proteins that also contribute to the disease pathology. The disease stems from a genetic mutation in the Huntingtin gene that produces too many copies of a DNA segment known as CAG, which gives rise to a longer Huntingtin protein with toxic effects. However, researchers found that this DNA repeat mutation can undergo a process known as repeat associated non-ATG (RAN) translation, producing four additional damaging repeat proteins that accumulate in the brain. This was a surprise to the researchers because these RAN proteins are made without a signal in the genetic code that was previously thought to be required for protein production. Each of the four RAN proteins contains long repeats of certain single protein building blocks, or amino acids. ""These repeat proteins are too long for cells to deal with and they build up as aggregated clusters that kill cells,"" Ranum said. Finding these novel RAN proteins in degenerated areas of the brain that were negative for the previously known mutant Huntington protein was crucial to linking them to the disease, said Monica Ba ez-Coronel, Ph.D., a postdoctoral associate and the first author of the journal article. Knowing that four proteins may underlie the disease also presents its own challenge. ""We now know that there are more players in the disease arena and it is likely that each one of these proteins contribute to Huntington disease,"" Ba ez-Coronel said. In addition to finding that the RAN proteins accumulate in the striatum, a specific brain region predominantly affected in Huntington disease, researchers also found them in the frontal cortex, cerebellum and white matter regions of the brain. Ba ez-Coronel said this was the first time the accumulated proteins related to Huntington's disease were extensively found in white matter, an inner part of the brain containing cells that support neuronal function. In the cerebellum -- a part of the brain at the back of the skull that controls movement and motor coordination -- the discovery of RAN proteins suggests that they may be responsible for some of the typical uncontrolled movements observed in Huntington disease patients, researchers said. On the basis of their findings, the researchers believe there is a possibility that RAN proteins contribute to eight other similar neurodegenerative disorders, including spinobulbar muscular atrophy and several types of spinocerebellar ataxia, which are also caused by an abnormal increase in the number of CAG repeats. Knowing that rogue proteins are implicated in Huntington's disease is just the first step. Ranum said further research is needed, and it will be important to understand how these proteins are being made without the normal cellular signals and if strategies to block their production can be developed. In addition to the possibility of new therapies, detecting these proteins may be useful for predicting the disease's onset, its progression and treatment responses, researchers said.","Published: November 23, 2015"

Each year, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) kills approximately 15,000 people in the United States. One of the major obstacles to treatment is the blood brain barrier, the network of blood vessels that allows essential nutrients to enter the brain but blocks the passage of other substances. What is desperately needed is a means of effectively transporting therapeutic drugs through this barrier. A nanoscience expert at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) may have the solution. Ting Xu, a polymer scientist with Berkeley Lab s Materials Sciences Division who specializes in self-assembling bio/nano hybrid materials, has developed a new family of nanocarriers formed from the self-assembly of amphiphilic peptides and polymers. Called  3HM  for coiled-coil 3-helix micelles, these new nanocarriers meet all the size and stability requirements for effectively delivering a therapeutic drug to GBM tumors. Amphiphiles are chemical compounds that feature both hydrophilic (water-loving) and lipophilic (fat-loving) properties. Micelles are spherical aggregates of amphiphiles.In a recent collaboration between Xu, Katherine Ferrara at the University of California (UC) Davis, and John Forsayeth and Krystof Bankiewicz of UC San Francisco, 3HM nanocarriers were tested on GBM tumors in rats. Using the radioactive form of copper (copper-64) in combination with positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the collaboration demonstrated that 3HM can cross the blood brain barrier and accumulate inside GBM tumors at nearly double the concentration rate of current FDA-approved nanocarriers.  Our 3HM nanocarriers show very good attributes for the treatment of brain cancers in terms of long circulation, deep tumor penetration and low accumulation in off-target organs such as the liver and spleen,  says Xu, who also holds a joint appointment with the UC Berkeley s Departments of Materials Sciences and Engineering, and Chemistry.  The fact that 3HM is able to cross the blood brain barrier of GBM-bearing rats and selectively accumulate within tumor tissue, opens the possibility of treating GBM via intravenous drug administration rather than invasive measures. While there is still a lot to learn about why 3HM is able to do what it does, so far all the results have been very positive.  Glial cells provide physical and chemical support for neurons. Approximately 90-percent of all the cells in the brain are glial cells which, unlike neurons, undergo a cycle of birth, differentiation, and mitosis. Undergoing this cycle makes glial cells vulnerable to becoming cancerous. When they do, as the name  multiforme  suggests, they can take on different shapes, which often makes detection difficult until the tumors are dangerously large. The multiple shapes of a cancerous glial cell also make it difficult to identify and locate all of the cell s tendrils. Removal or destruction of the main tumor mass while leaving these tendrils intact is ineffective therapy: like the mythical Hydra, the tendrils will sprout new tumors. Although there are FDA approved therapeutic drugs for the treatment of GBM, these treatments have had little impact on patient survival rate because the blood brain barrier has limited the accumulation of therapeutics within the brain. Typically, GBM therapeutics are ferried across the blood brain barrier in special liposomes that are approximately 110 nanometers in size. The 3HM nanocarriers developed by Xu and her group are only about 20 nanometers in size. Their smaller size and unique hierarchical structure afforded the 3HM nanocarriers much greater access to rat GBM tumors than 110-nanometer liposomes in the tests carried out by Xu and her colleagues.  3HM is a product of basic research at the interface of materials science and biology,  Xu says.  When I first started at Berkeley, I explored hybrid nanomaterials based on proteins, peptides and polymers as a new family of biomaterials. During the process of understanding the hierarchical assembly of amphiphilic peptide-polymer conjugates, my group and I noticed some unusual behavior of these micelles, especially their unusual kinetic stability in the 20 nanometer size range. We looked into critical needs for nanocarriers with these attributes and identified the treatment of GBM cancer as a potential application.  Copper-64 was used to label both 3HM and liposome nanocarriers for systematic PET and MRI studies to find out how a nanocarrier s size might affect the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in rats with GBM tumors. The results not only confirmed the effectiveness of 3HM as GBM delivery vessels, they also suggest that PET and MRI imaging of nanoparticle distribution and tumor kinetics can be used to improve the future design of nanoparticles for GBM treatment.  I thought our 3HM hybrid materials could bring new therapeutic opportunities for GBM but I did not expect it to happen so quickly,  says Xu, who has been awarded a patent for the 3HM technology.","Published: November 23, 2015"

Sixteen studies have been funded as part of a call for more research into drug resistant infections, also known as antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Drug resistant infections present a major threat to the future of healthcare and by 2050 could result in 10 million avoidable deaths every year, from antibiotic resistant infections such as MRSA, sepsis and multi-drug-resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis.  The Oxford study is looking at how to improve the prescribing of antibiotics. Prescribing is a complex, challenging task and potentially a high-risk area of clinical practice. For example, prescribing errors occur in 7% of hospital prescriptions and 50% of hospital admissions. Improved stewardship of antibiotic prescribing could be part of the solution to the development of AMR. This study will investigate the many contextual factors that could help explain why some approaches to improve prescribing behaviour are more effective than others are. Lead researcher Dr Geoff Wong, from University of Oxford commented: 'Doctors in training are an important group to focus on, being numerically the largest group of prescribers in UK hospitals. Our review will explain and describe the steps needed to bring about appropriate antimicrobial prescribing behaviour change in doctors in training.' Professor Dame Sally C. Davies, Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser at the Department of Health said: 'Antimicrobial resistance is a very serious problem for society causing 5,000 deaths in the UK each year. We will lose this battle unless we get more evidence on how to prevent resistance in bacteria developing. That is why the research that the NIHR has committed to funding is so vital.

Commonly called ALS or Lou Gehrig s disease, the neurodegenerative disease kills off motor nerves and brain cells and inhibits the muscles responsible for moving, eating, and breathing. ALS has no cure, in part because of the difficult nature of studying the affected cells. A discovery led by Gregorio Valdez, an assistant professor at the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute, might make researching the mechanisms of the disease easier.  We discovered that proprioceptive sensory neurons connected with muscles are affected early in ALS while those connected with tendons that sense changes in muscle tension are mostly spared,  said Valdez, who is also an assistant professor of biological sciences in Virginia Tech s College of Science.  That was a big surprise, and it shows that ALS targets select neurons, particularly those with critical functions in muscles.  In the study, published in the Journal of Comparative Neurology, Valdez used a rodent model to examine proprioceptive sensory neurons. These neurons connect with muscles and motor neurons in the spinal cord to help animals including humans understand their physical sense of self.  Proprioceptive sensory neurons are much easier to study than motor neurons, the main cells affected in ALS,  Valdez said.  Sensory neurons can stay alive for weeks and even months in the laboratory. This relative longevity can give scientists a better tool to identify and test potential therapeutics for the disease.  The researchers found that neurons degenerated before neurological symptoms appeared. They also discovered that degeneration begins in the cells  connections with muscles before spreading to the spinal cord.  Understanding how and why certain cell types resist neurodegeneration and others succumb is a critical step in designing interventions,  said Erin Foff, an assistant professor of neurology at the University of Virginia and a medical doctor who treats ALS patients. She was not involved in this research.  Dr. Valdez s exciting work offers additional information regarding a poorly understood feature of ALS.

But researchers are warning that the results do not mean marijuana has a beneficial effect on fetal development. The study from the University of Waterloo, University of Aukland and Brown University appears in the journal Scientific Reports.  We were surprised with this initial finding,  said Ben Thompson, a professor in Waterloo s School of Optometry and Vision Science in the Faculty of Science.  It shows that marijuana and alcohol can have quite an impact on a fundamental aspect of the visual processing happening in our brains. But despite the apparently beneficial impact of marijuana on the development of the brain s visual system, other research shows its use can actually impair the brain development of unborn children.  The researchers tested higher-level visual processing in a group of 4 year-old children who were exposed to different combinations of marijuana, alcohol, methyl amphetamines, or nicotine while in the womb, compared with a non-exposed control group. Drug exposure was confirmed objectively by analyzing each baby s meconium. Results showed exposure to marijuana improved global motion perception, a measure of processing within the brain s dorsal visual pathway which is responsible for motion processing and visual-motor control. In contrast, exposure to alcohol had a negative effect. Nicotine and methamphetamine had no effect on vision compared with the control group. This is the first time researchers have shown opposing effects of drug exposure on children s visual development. Their conclusions suggest that health professionals could counteract the negative effects of drug use in pregnancy. But they caution this is a preliminary result of a much more comprehensive study.  We don t know how widespread this effect is on other parts of the brain s visual processing areas,  said Thompson.  The dorsal area is the first area we test because it s the most vulnerable to risk factors during early development.  Thompson and his colleagues at the University of Auckland modified a global motion perception test for use with young children as a quantitative means to measure dorsal pathway performance. The test measures the child s ability to track a group of moving dots together across a screen despite the presence of randomly moving dots. The percentage of randomly moving dots is increased until the child can no longer tell which way the dots are moving. Thompson is currently developing a semi-automated objective motion processing test that can be used across different age groups that may help to track early brain development problems.  The advantage with this type of vision testing is that performance can be measured precisely,  said Professor Thompson.  In the future we hope to be able incorporate brain imaging with the global motion perception test to understand how and why these drugs are interacting with the visual parts of our brains.  The children were part of the international IDEAL (Infant Development, Environment and Lifestyle) study, which looked at the effects of prenatal drug and alcohol use on a range of motor and cognitive skills.

Published in NeuroImage, Sarah Schipul and Marcel Just examined how the brains of typical and ASD individuals gradually became adapted to visual patterns they were learning, without awareness of the pattern, or implicit learning. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Schipul and Just found that the brain activation of ASD individuals was slower to become familiar with the pattern they repeatedly saw, meaning their brains failed to register the ""oldness"" of the patterns to the same degree that the control participants did. The brains of the control participants kept decreasing their level of activation with repeated exposures to the patterns being learned showing adaptation whereas the decreases in the brain of participants with ASD were significantly smaller. They also found that the severity of an individual's autism symptoms correlated with the brain's degree of adaptation to the patterns. The findings provide insight into why many real-world implicit learning situations, such as learning to interpret facial expressions, pose challenges for those with ASD. ""This finding provides a tentative explanation for why people with ASD might have difficulty with everyday social interactions, if their learning of implicit social cues has been altered,"" said Just, the D.O. Hebb University Professor of Psychology in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. While having their brains scanned, 16 high-functioning adults with ASD and 16 typical adults were trained to perform an implicit dot pattern-learning task. The target pattern was a random array of dots, which can gradually become familiar over multiple exposures despite minor changes in the pattern. Prior to the brain scan, both groups were familiarized with the type of task that would be used in the scanner. The ASD participants took longer than the control group to learn the task, demonstrating altered implicit learning in ASD. After equalizing the task structure learning and using the fMRI scanner, the two groups' brain activation differed while they were learning a new dot pattern. The imaging showed that at the beginning of the learning session, both groups' brain activation levels were similar. By the end of the task, the typical participants showed decreased activation in the posterior regions. The ASD participants' brain activation did not decrease later in learning. In fact, it increased in frontal and parietal regions. ""Behaviorally, the two groups looked very similar throughout the task oth the ASD and typical participants were able to learn how to correctly categorize the dot patterns with reasonable accuracy,"" Just said. ""But, because their activation levels differed, it tells us that there may be something qualitatively different in the way individuals with ASD learn and perform these kinds of task and reveals insights into the disorder that are not discernable from behavior alone."" A second finding involved brain synchronization a measure of how well coordinated the brain activation was across different regions of the brain. The implicit learning exercise was specifically designed to engage both the frontal and posterior regions of the brain, and the results showed that brain synchronization between these regions was lower in ASD. This supports Just's 2004 influential ""Frontal-Posterior Underconnectivity Theory of Autism,"" which first discovered this lower synchronization. In later studies, Just showed how this theory accounted for many brain imaging and behavioral findings in tasks that required a substantial role for the frontal cortex. ""This lack of synchronization with frontal regions in ASD an impairment in brain connectivity may lead to symptoms of the disorder that involve processes that require brain coordination between frontal and other areas, such as language processing and social interaction,"" Just explained. The researchers also found that adaptation and synchronization were directly related to the severity of the participants' ASD symptoms. ""Seeing that individuals with more atypical neural responses also had more severe ASD symptoms suggests that these neural characteristics underlie or contribute to the core symptoms of ASD,"" Just said. ""It is possible that reduced neural adaptability during learning in ASD may lead to the behavioral symptoms of the disorder. For example, the ability to learn implicit social clues may be affected in ASD, leading to impaired social processing."" Schipul, who received her bachelor's degree in cognitive science and PhD in psychology from Carnegie Mellon and is now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Just believe that therapeutic approaches for ASD might benefit from making the learning of various everyday skills that people without ASD learn implicitly very clear.

Wataru Sato and his team at Kyoto University have found an answer from a neurological perspective. Overall happiness, according to their study, is a combination of happy emotions and satisfaction of life coming together in the precuneus, a region in the medial parietal lobe that becomes active when experiencing consciousness. People feel emotions in different ways; for instance, some people feel happiness more intensely than others when they receive compliments. Psychologists have found that emotional factors like these and satisfaction of life together constitutes the subjective experience of being ""happy"". The neural mechanism behind how happiness emerges, however, remained unclear. Understanding that mechanism, according to Sato, will be a huge asset for quantifying levels of happiness objectively. Sato and his team scanned the brains of research participants with MRI. The participants then took a survey that asked how happy they are generally, how intensely they feel emotions, and how satisfied they are with their lives. The correlation between the right precuneus and subjective happiness. Left: The location of the precuneus. Right: Scatterplot showing the relationship between grey matter mass and subjective happiness. Credit: Kyoto University  Their analysis revealed that those who scored higher on the happiness surveys had more gray matter mass in the precuneus. In other words, people who feel happiness more intensely, feel sadness less intensely, and are more able to find meaning in life have a larger precuneus. ""Over history, many eminent scholars like Aristotle have contemplated what happiness is,"" lead author Wataru Sato said. ""I'm very happy that we now know more about what it means to be happy."" So how does that help us? Sato is hopeful about the implications this has for happiness training. ""Several studies have shown that meditation increases gray matter mass in the precuneus. This new insight on where happiness happens in the brain will be useful for developing happiness programs based on scientific research,"" he said. Kyoto University  press release Sato W et al.

By analyzing the reported sexual behavior, identity and attraction of more than 33,000 American adults, they found that 3 percent of men and 2.7 percent of women are not heterosexual. They also found notable issues on several mental health fronts. The findings are a clear departure from the homosexual-heterosexual continuum used to describe sexual orientation since it was hypothesized by sexologist Alfred Kinsey in 1948. However, the findings do support more recent biological hypotheses of sexual orientation. ""There are distinct qualitative differences in sexual orientation, which means that there are distinct categories of people based on sexual orientation,"" said Alyssa Norris, a WSU doctoral candidate and lead author of the study, published in the journal Psychological Science. Norris and her colleagues also identified several alarming mental health issues among non-heterosexuals. Nearly three out of ten non-heterosexual men--roughly twice that of heterosexual men--met the diagnostic criteria for depression. Non-heterosexual women were much more likely to abuse or depend on alcohol. Non-heterosexual men and women were more likely to meet the criteria for anxiety and other mood disorders and to think about suicide. The researchers said the social stigmatization of gays, lesbians and other non-heterosexuals could be a factor in their mental health. ""By actually getting some understanding of how to categorize people and the unique challenges they face, we're getting a lot more insight into their well-being and their experiences,"" said Norris. Norris, WSU psychology department chair David Marcus, and Bradley Green of the University of Southern Mississippi used data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, which conducted personal interviews with more than 35,000 randomly selected adults. The survey asked respondents about which genders they've had sex with, getting at the behavior studied by Kinsey, as well as their sexual identity and who they're most attracted to. Attraction, said Norris, has only recently been regularly studied, although one could argue it is most central to one's sexual orientation. Norris, Marcus, and Green used a set of statistical methods called taxometrics, which was developed specifically to determine if people are distributed on a spectrum or if they are part of meaningful groups, or taxons. ""People at some point are crossing a threshold between one group and another group,"" said Marcus. ""Why they do it, we can't answer in this study. But that they do it tells researchers they should be looking at that question, not as much at the continuum question. The most radical, extreme version of that would be to say Kinsey led a lot of this research down the wrong path as much as he was a pioneer whose work helped destigmatize same-sex relationship and inclinations."" The researchers' findings have numerous implications. Foremost, they say, is the ability to home in on the mental health impact of cultural issues non-heterosexuals are more likely to face. The findings are also consistent with those of biologists who examine how genes and hormones shape sexual orientation. Another implication of the findings is they leave little room for calling homosexuality a lifestyle choice. ""A lifestyle does not fit into a taxon,"" said Marcus. ""People who use the language of 'choice' and 'lifestyle' are negating 'born that way' or any of the terminology that would assume that these are genuine differences that are legitimate."" Marcus said the findings also go against the notion of ""conversion therapy,"" which ostensibly would move a person along a continuum towards heterosexuality. ""Conversion therapy is fundamentally changing who they are,"" he said. ""Generally we can't do that in psychology.""' Rather, the taxometric results establish a group of people that are, in effect, bona fide heterosexuals. Then there's another group that is not a continuum but an assemblage, a variety of people united in their same-sex sexual orientation but who may reflect diverse sexual identities.

New research indicates that persistent inflammation affects the brain in ways that are connected with stubborn symptoms of depression, such as anhedonia, the inability to experience pleasure. The findings, published in Molecular Psychiatry,  bolster the case that the high-inflammation form of depression is distinct, and are guiding researchers' plans to test treatments tailored for it. Anhedonia is a core symptom of depression that is particularly difficult to treat, says lead author Jennifer Felger, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute. ""Some patients taking antidepressants continue to suffer from anhedonia,"" Felger says. ""Our data suggest that by blocking inflammation or its effects on the brain, we may be able to reverse anhedonia and help depressed individuals who fail to respond to antidepressants."" In a study of 48 patients with depression, high levels of the inflammatory marker CRP (C-reactive protein) were linked with a ""failure to communicate,"" seen through brain imaging, between regions of the brain important for motivation and reward. Neuroscientists can infer that two regions of the brain talk to each other by watching whether they light up in magnetic resonance imaging at the same times or in the same patterns, even when someone is not doing anything in particular. They describe this as ""functional connectivity."" In patients with high CRP, Felger and her colleagues observed a lack of connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum. In contrast, patients with low CRP had robust connectivity, they write. ""We were interested in these regions of the brain because of their known importance for response to reward,"" she says. ""In addition, we had seen reduced activation of these areas in people receiving immuno-stimulatory treatments for hepatitis C virus or cancer, which suggested that they may be sensitive to inflammation."" High CRP levels were also correlated with patients' reports of anhedonia: an inability to derive enjoyment from everyday activities, such as food or time with family and friends. Low connectivity between another region of the striatum and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was linked to a different symptom: slow motor function, as measured by finger tapping speed. During the brain imaging portion of the study, participants were not taking antidepressants, anti-inflammatory drugs or other medications for at least four weeks, and CRP was measured on repeat visits to make sure its levels were stable. High CRP was also correlated with BMI (body mass index), but the statistical relationship was strong even after correcting for BMI and other variables such as age. A previous study of people with difficult-to-treat depression found that those with high inflammation (as measured with CRP), but not other participants in the study, improved in response to the anti-inflammatory antibody infliximab. As a next step, Felger is planning to test whether L-DOPA, a medicine that targets the brain chemical dopamine, can increase connectivity in reward-related brain regions in patients with high-inflammation depression. This upcoming study is being supported by the Dana Foundation. Felger's previous research in non-human primates suggests that inflammation leads to reduced dopamine release. L-DOPA is a precursor for dopamine and often given to people with Parkinson's disease. ""We hope our investigations may lead to new therapies to treat anhedonia in high-inflammation depression,"" she says.

Publishing in Cell Metabolism, the researchers show that dietary restriction, induced by reducing protein in the diet, increased the amplitude of circadian clocks and enhanced the cycles of fat breakdown and fat synthesis. This improvement in fat metabolism may be a key mechanism in explaining why dietary restriction extends lifespan in several species, including the flies in this study. The research also presents a tantalizing possibility for humans eager to take a drug that would allow them to reap the health benefits of dietary restriction without going on an extreme diet. When scientists genetically altered the flies to boost clock function the animals lived longer, even when they ate whatever they wanted to. On the other hand, disrupting the clocks, either genetically or by keeping the flies under constant light, made the animals irresponsive to the beneficial effects of dietary restriction.  More than 10-15% of the genome is under circadian control, especially genes which regulate processes involving cellular repair and metabolism,  said senior scientist and Buck professor Pankaj Kapahi, PhD.  Every cell has a clock and the action of clocks in peripheral tissues fat, intestines, kidneys plays an important role in modulating metabolism and thereby mediating lifespan extension via dietary restriction.  Previous work from the Kapahi lab showed that flies on a lifespan-extending Spartan diet exhibited an enhanced turnover of triglycerides. This new work, also led by Buck assistant research professor Subhash D. Katewa, PhD, suggests a role for timeless, a circadian clock gene, in the cycling of specific medium chain triglycerides under dietary restriction.  The role of medium chain triglycerides in aging and regulation of clock functions is not clear, however dietary medium chain triglycerides have been associated with weight loss and improved healthspan in both humans and mice,  said Katewa, noting current consumer interest in coconut oil which is rich in medium chain triglycerides.   Our work demonstrates for the first time that medium chain triglyceride synthesis in animals is under nutritional and circadian control,  he said.   If we want to modulate the effects of nutrient manipulation on fat metabolism and aging then targeting the activity of peripheral circadian clocks gives us a way to achieve that goal.   Circadian rhythms, which impact many behaviors like sleep or cellular processes like metabolism, tend to dampen with age,  said Kapahi.  The metabolic rhythms of flies on dietary restriction maintain a remarkable robustness as they age, which we think helps them live longer.  It is exciting to contemplate how this mechanism might be exploited for human health.  Buck Institute  press release Katewa SD et al.

A team of researchers has now discovered a new mechanism for influencing ion channels in epilepsy. They found that spermine inside neurons dampens the neurons excitability. In epilepsy, spermine levels decrease, causing hyperexcitability. The researchers hope that their findings can be exploited to develop new therapies for epilepsies. They are reporting their findings in the Journal of Neuroscience. Approximately one out of a hundred people suffer from epilepsy and one out of twenty suffer a seizure at least once during their lifetime. Seizures occur when many nerve cells in the brain fire in synchrony. Scientists are searching for the causes leading to this simultaneous excitation of brain cells. Researchers at the Univesrity of Bonn Department of Epileptology, the Institute for Neuropathology and the Institute for Molecular Psychiatry, together with the Caesar Research Center and the Hebrew University (Israel) have discovered a mechanism which previously was not thought to be involved in the development of epilepsy. Neurons integrate many inputs together to then determine an appropriate output, and sodium channels play a key role in both processes. ""They play an important role in the excitation of nerve cell axons and signal transfer between various cells,"" says Prof. Dr. Heinz Beck, who conducts research in experimental epileptology at the Department of Epileptology, at the Life & Brain center and the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE). Like a type of door, sodium channels allow sodium ions to flow into nerve cells through tiny pores. They consist of large protein complexes located in the membranes of nerve cells. The scientists found a large increase in a certain sodium influx which significantly increased the excitability of cells in the epileptic animal. For this reason, scientists working with Prof. Beck initially compared the sodium channel proteins from the brains of epileptic rats to those of healthy animals. ""However, this did not reveal any increased formation of sodium channel proteins, which could have explained the overexcitation of nerve cells."" reports the epilepsy researcher. After a long search, the team of researchers found a completely different group of substances: the polyamines. Spermine belongs to this group; it is produced in cells and plugs the pores of the sodium channels from within. like a doorman. In this case, the influx of sodium ions is blocked and the excitation of the nerve cells is reduced. The scientists investigated how much of the seizure-inhibiting substance is present in the nerve cells of rats suffering from epilepsy and compared the values to those of healthy animals. ""The amount of spermine in the cells of the hippocampus was significantly reduced in diseased animals as compared to the healthy animals,"" report the lead authors Dr. Michel Royeck and Dr. Thoralf Optiz from Dr. Beck's team. ""Furthermore, the reduced spermine in the nerve cell led to increased excitability; the cells were more sensitive to input and generated more output"" said fellow lead author Dr. Tony Kelly. The investigators tested this important finding, compensating for the deficiency in the nerve cells of epileptic rats by adding spermine back into the cell. As a result, the increase in sodium currents was reversed and the excitability of the neuron returned to normal. The lower level of spermine in the epileptic rat's brain was evidently caused by an upregulation of spermidine/spermine-N(1)-acetyltransferase. This enzyme breaks down the spermine which is important in the control of sodium channels. According to the scientists, this result could be a potential starting point for novel epilepsy therapies. ""If a substance was available to reduce the activity of acetyltransferase back to normal levels, the lack of spermine and thus the symptoms of epilepsy could be mitigated,"" speculates Prof. Beck. However, concrete therapeutic applications are still a long way off.Universit t Bonn   press release Royeck M et al.

Each year, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) kills approximately 15,000 people in the United States. One of the major obstacles to treatment is the blood brain barrier, the network of blood vessels that allows essential nutrients to enter the brain but blocks the passage of other substances. What is desperately needed is a means of effectively transporting therapeutic drugs through this barrier. A nanoscience expert at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) may have the solution. Ting Xu, a polymer scientist with Berkeley Lab s Materials Sciences Division who specializes in self-assembling bio/nano hybrid materials, has developed a new family of nanocarriers formed from the self-assembly of amphiphilic peptides and polymers. Called  3HM  for coiled-coil 3-helix micelles, these new nanocarriers meet all the size and stability requirements for effectively delivering a therapeutic drug to GBM tumors. Amphiphiles are chemical compounds that feature both hydrophilic (water-loving) and lipophilic (fat-loving) properties. Micelles are spherical aggregates of amphiphiles. In a recent collaboration between Xu, Katherine Ferrara at the University of California (UC) Davis, and John Forsayeth and Krystof Bankiewicz of UC San Francisco, 3HM nanocarriers were tested on GBM tumors in rats. Using the radioactive form of copper (copper-64) in combination with positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the collaboration demonstrated that 3HM can cross the blood brain barrier and accumulate inside GBM tumors at nearly double the concentration rate of current FDA-approved nanocarriers.  Our 3HM nanocarriers show very good attributes for the treatment of brain cancers in terms of long circulation, deep tumor penetration and low accumulation in off-target organs such as the liver and spleen,  says Xu, who also holds a joint appointment with the UC Berkeley s Departments of Materials Sciences and Engineering, and Chemistry.  The fact that 3HM is able to cross the blood brain barrier of GBM-bearing rats and selectively accumulate within tumor tissue, opens the possibility of treating GBM via intravenous drug administration rather than invasive measures. While there is still a lot to learn about why 3HM is able to do what it does, so far all the results have been very positive.  Glial cells provide physical and chemical support for neurons. Approximately 90-percent of all the cells in the brain are glial cells which, unlike neurons, undergo a cycle of birth, differentiation, and mitosis. Undergoing this cycle makes glial cells vulnerable to becoming cancerous. When they do, as the name  multiforme  suggests, they can take on different shapes, which often makes detection difficult until the tumors are dangerously large. The multiple shapes of a cancerous glial cell also make it difficult to identify and locate all of the cell s tendrils. Removal or destruction of the main tumor mass while leaving these tendrils intact is ineffective therapy: like the mythical Hydra, the tendrils will sprout new tumors. Although there are FDA approved therapeutic drugs for the treatment of GBM, these treatments have had little impact on patient survival rate because the blood brain barrier has limited the accumulation of therapeutics within the brain. Typically, GBM therapeutics are ferried across the blood brain barrier in special liposomes that are approximately 110 nanometers in size. The 3HM nanocarriers developed by Xu and her group are only about 20 nanometers in size. Their smaller size and unique hierarchical structure afforded the 3HM nanocarriers much greater access to rat GBM tumors than 110-nanometer liposomes in the tests carried out by Xu and her colleagues. At only 20 nanometers in size and featuring a unique hierarchical structure, 3HM nanocarriers meet all the size and stability requirements for effectively delivering therapeutic drugs to brain cancer tumors. Credit: Berkeley Lab   3HM is a product of basic research at the interface of materials science and biology,  Xu says.  When I first started at Berkeley, I explored hybrid nanomaterials based on proteins, peptides and polymers as a new family of biomaterials. During the process of understanding the hierarchical assembly of amphiphilic peptide-polymer conjugates, my group and I noticed some unusual behavior of these micelles, especially their unusual kinetic stability in the 20 nanometer size range. We looked into critical needs for nanocarriers with these attributes and identified the treatment of GBM cancer as a potential application.  Copper-64 was used to label both 3HM and liposome nanocarriers for systematic PET and MRI studies to find out how a nanocarrier s size might affect the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in rats with GBM tumors. The results not only confirmed the effectiveness of 3HM as GBM delivery vessels, they also suggest that PET and MRI imaging of nanoparticle distribution and tumor kinetics can be used to improve the future design of nanoparticles for GBM treatment.  I thought our 3HM hybrid materials could bring new therapeutic opportunities for GBM but I did not expect it to happen so quickly,  says Xu, who has been awarded a patent for the 3HM technology.

A study published in Chemistry & Biology, for example, found that a protein in E. coli bacteria combined with small molecules can act synergistically to push pluripotent cells into functional neurons. The research began when Sungkyunkwan University scientists in Korea made a serendipitous discovery that Sox2--one of the four Yamanaka factors that affect a stem cell's ability to remain a stem cell or differentiate--can bind to a bacterial chaperone protein, Skp. They then tested what would happen if Skp was introduced into stem cells and found that it could initiate differentiation. This led to the hypothesis that Skp could be combined with other techniques to make differentiation more efficient. ""Although there has been considerable research in this field, there is still a bottleneck in being able to produce a high number of stem cells efficiently,"" says study co-author Kyeong Kyu Kim, of the Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine. ""This problem can be solved, but we need to look for new ways to guide stem cell differentiation and then understand the molecular mechanisms underlying improved protocols."" Injae Shin of Yonsei University and Kim say that the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells can be conceived as two simple steps: first, a stem cell decides to no longer be a stem cell and begins to differentiate; second, the cell decides what kind of cell it wants to be. In their protocol to induce neuron differentiation, the bacterial protein Skp acts in the first step by binding to Sox2 and inhibiting its function. The small chemicals neurodazine (Nz) and neurodazole (Nzl) then act in the second step by telling the stem cell to become a neuron. By influencing both steps, more functional neurons can be produced per batch of stem cells and at a faster rate if using either protein or small molecules alone. ""The synergy thus mainly arises from combining suppression of stemness by protein and directing lineage-specific commitment by chemical inducers,"" Shin says. ""Hence this process stands as an example of rationally designed cell differentiation to achieve a high level of lineage commitment efficiency."" One weakness of the protocol is that there are safety concerns around using bacterial proteins such as Skp in a therapeutic setting. However, using this protein is advantageous compared to introducing genetic elements because protein cannot cause any genetic alteration or instability, which are the major concerns of using virus-mediated gene delivery to the stem cells. The authors hope that this study can encourage others to develop similar approaches based on small molecule mimics of the first stage of stemness suppression. They are now working on using similar combinatorial approaches to explore how to make differentiation more efficient in other cell types, particularly those in the heart. Cell PressHalder D et al.

Scientists have long sought to understand the driving forces in this meticulously choreographed dance, in which each cell seems to know precisely where to be to at any given time, and with what other cells it must link. In particular, intensive research has been focused on axon guidance, a process in which a neuron sends a wiry extension to seek out a partner cell and connect to it. In a study published in Science, Rockefeller University researchers report on their discovery of a molecule secreted by cells in the spinal cord that helps guide axons during a critical stage of central nervous system (CNS) development.  A type of cell called a commissural neuron projects axons from one side of the nervous system to the other, across an embryonic structure known as the midline,  explains Marc Tessier-Lavigne, who led the research. Tessier-Lavigne is the Carson Family Professor and head of the Laboratory of Brain Development and Repair, and President of Rockefeller University. Working in mice, Tessier-Lavigne, postdoctoral fellow Alexander Jaworski (now on the faculty at Brown University), and their collaborators identified the new axon guidance factor, NELL2, and elucidated how it makes commissural axons creep toward the midline, and how the axons then depart from this area to reach their final destination. Commissural neurons build circuits that connect the right and left sides of the CNS. A number of inborn diseases have been linked to early developmental failures in which commissural axons lose their way and make inappropriate connections.In the past two decades, work led by Tessier-Lavigne and others has identified a number of cell-secreted molecules including two groups of proteins called Netrins and Slits that direct the routes of these axons. These factors can directionally attract or repel axons by binding to receptors on their tips. But scientists still have an incomplete understanding of how neurons receive and integrate inputs from several guidance cues at once, or how their responsiveness to certain factors changes over time.  For example, commissural neurons are able to get to the midline because they are attracted there by certain factors, including Netrins,  Tessier-Lavigne says.  But once they ve crossed the midline, they need to move on, and to do so the neurons somehow switch off their sensitivity to the attractants. At the same time, the neurons become sensitive to repelling factors in the midline, such as Slits. This prevents them from backtracking and helps them move forward.  From previous work, the researchers knew that a receptor protein called Robo3 is a key controller of the switch in which commissural neurons are initially attracted to the midline and then begin to avoid it. They also knew that it did so by boosting the action of attractants (Netrins) and blocking the action of repellents (Slits). In the current study, which began while Tessier-Lavigne and Jaworski were at Genentech and was continued at Rockefeller, the researchers made the unexpected discovery that Robo3 has a third action that dovetails with the first two. By biochemically isolating proteins that bind to Robo3 from a vast pool of cell-secreted factors, they found that a protein called NELL2 binds to Robo3. In a series of mouse experiments, they were able to show that NELL2 is present in the developing spinal cord and directs the paths of commissural axons through repulsion by activating Robo3 receptors.  We found that NELL2 is an axon-repulsion factor that helps the axon get to the midline,  Tessier-Lavigne says.  The Robo3 receptor therefore receives and coordinates input from not one but at least three diverse signaling molecules NELL2, Netrins, and Slits to fine tune an axon s journey across and away from the midline.  The findings not only shed new light on the biology of axon guidance in a general sense, but could also help scientists understand what goes wrong in a rare disease called horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis, which has been linked to mutations in the gene that codes for Robo3. People affected by the condition often suffer from abnormal spine curvature, and are unable to move their eyes horizontally from side to side complications that arise early in development when commissural axons fail to cross the midline.

In a study published in Nature, researchers report that when tissue damage occurs, in times of excessive bleeding, or during pregnancy, a secondary, emergency blood-formation system is activated in the spleen.  Hematopoietic, or blood-forming, stem cells reside mainly in the bone marrow, and most new blood cell formation occurs within the bone marrow under normal circumstances. But when there is hematopoietic stress, blood cell formation expands to the spleen,  said Dr. Sean Morrison, CRI Director and Mary McDermott Cook Chair in Pediatric Genetics at UT Southwestern Medical Center.  Blood-forming stem cells migrate from the bone marrow to the spleen, which becomes a hematopoietic organ where blood formation then occurs.  Normally, there are very few blood-forming stem cells in the spleen. But the cells that create the supporting environment for these stem cells are present in the spleen, ready to respond during times of hematopoietic stress and to receive an influx of blood-forming stem cells from the bone marrow. In characterizing the microenvironment, or niche, which supports blood formation in the spleen, the CRI research team used mouse models to examine the expression patterns of two known niche cell factors, stem cell factor (SCF) and CXCL12. The researchers found that the blood-forming microenvironment in the spleen is found near sinusoidal blood vessels and is created by endothelial cells and perivascular stromal cells   just like the microenvironment in the bone marrow.  Under emergency conditions, the endothelial cells and perivascular stromal cells that reside in the spleen are induced to proliferate, so they can sustain all the new blood-forming stem cells that migrate into the spleen,  said Dr. Morrison, who is also a CPRIT Scholar in Cancer Research and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator.  We determined that this process in the spleen is physiologically important for responding to hematopoietic stress; without it, the mice we studied could not maintain normal blood cell counts during pregnancy or quickly regenerate blood cell counts after bleeding or chemotherapy.

(Headquarters: Lugano, Switzerland, CEO: Riccardo Braglia, ""Helsinn"") in the patent infringement lawsuit for antiemetic agent ALOXI (palonosetron hydrochloride) brought by Helsinn together with Roche Palo Alto LLC (Roche) against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (collectively ""Teva"") in the United States, where it was determined that certain formulation patent claims for ALOXI are valid and infringed. Since 2011, Helsinn and Roche filed patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, against Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Ltd., Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc. (collectively ""Dr. Reddy's""), Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz) and Teva, who were the first to submit Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for ALOXI. Of these companies, Helsinn has already made settlements with Sandoz and Dr. Reddy's, and under the conditions of the settlements, in principle, neither Sandoz nor Dr. Reddy's is allowed to launch a generic version of palonosetron hydrochloride via an ANDA prior to September 30, 2018, except under certain circumstances. In this decision which concerns Teva, the court ruled that the patent claims at issue are valid and are infringed. The term of these formulation patent rights plus pediatric exclusivity currently provides coverage for ALOXI through to July 30, 2024, subject to any appeal. In addition, patent infringement lawsuits were brought by Helsinn and Roche against several other companies who subsequently filed ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications for ALOXI after Dr. Reddy's, Sandoz and Teva. Some of these lawsuits have been settled while the remaining lawsuits are currently being disputed in U.S. District Courts. Helsinn and Roche continue to aggressively litigate these cases, and the outcome of those litigations and any resolutions reached by the parties will ultimately determine the date of generic entry. Eisai's U.S. subsidiary Eisai Inc. gained exclusive marketing rights to ALOXI in the United States and Canada from Helsinn. ALOXI is co-promoted in the United States by Eisai Inc. and Helsinn Therapeutics U.S. Inc., while sales of the product in the United States are booked by Eisai Inc. Upon obtaining this ruling, there will be no changes at the present time to Eisai's full-year consolidated financial results forecasts for the year ending March 31, 2016 as announced on May 14, 2015. Should a revision to the financial results forecasts become necessary in the future, the company will make an announcement as soon as possible.","Published: November 20, 2015"

The patterns of light and dark that fall on the retina provide a wealth of information about the world around us, yet scientists still don't understand how this information is encoded by neural circuits in the visual cortex a part of the brain that plays a critical role in building the neural representations that are responsible for sight. But things just got a lot clearer with the discovery that the majority of neurons in visual cortex respond selectivity to light vs dark, and they combine this information with selectivity for other stimulus features to achieve a detailed representation of the visual scene. Scientists have long known that neurons in the retina that provide information to higher centers in the brain respond selectively to light vs dark stimuli. 'ON' cells that respond selectively to light stimuli and 'OFF' cells that respond selectively to dark stimuli were known to form separate parallel channels relaying information to circuits in visual cortex. But here is where the picture got murky. Based on recording the responses of single cortical neurons with electrodes, it appeared that as soon as the ON and OFF channels entered the cortex, they converged onto single neurons, a convergence necessary for the emergence of a novel cortical response property: selectivity for the orientation of edges. Further stages in cortical processing were thought to lead to more and more mixing of the ON and OFF signals, so that individual neurons responded similarly to both dark and light stimuli. These results raised an obvious question: If the responses of single cortical neurons to dark and light are ambiguous, how is it that the brain allows us to perceive these differences? Drs. Gordon Smith and David Whitney in David Fitzpatrick's lab at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience decided it was time to revisit this question. Using new imaging technologies that make it possible for the first time to visualize the activity of hundreds of neurons simultaneously in the living brain, they quantified the responses of neurons in ferret visual cortex to light and dark stimulation. The first surprise for the team happened when they looked at cortical responses to the presentation of uniform dark or light stimuli. Although previous studies had not observed responses to uniform luminance changes, Smith et al. were not only able to visualize neurons that responded to these stimuli, they discovered patches of neurons that responded preferentially to dark vs light stimulation. Even more surprising, they found that the cortical neurons that responded selectively to the orientation of edges or to the direction of stimulus motion also responded preferentially to dark vs light stimuli. In short, the Max Planck Florida scientists discovered that information about dark and light is preserved in the responses of most neurons in visual cortex, and it is an integral part of the neural code that cortical circuits use to represent our visual world. The next challenge for Max Planck Florida scientists is to understand the precise patterns of synaptic connections that enable cortical circuits to construct this modular representation of black and white.

According to Dr. William Katz, co-author of the study and professor at UT Dallas' Callier Center for Communication Disorders, the findings could be especially helpful for stroke patients seeking to improve their speech articulation. ""These results show that individuals can be taught consonant sounds in part by watching 3D tongue images,"" said Katz, who teaches in the UT Dallas School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences. ""But we also are seeking to use visual feedback to get at the underlying nature of apraxia and other related disorders."" The study, which appears in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, was small but showed that participants became more accurate in learning new sounds when they were exposed to visual feedback training. Katz is one of the first researchers to suggest that the visual feedback on tongue movements could help stroke patients recover speech. ""People with apraxia of speech can have trouble with this process. They typically know what they want to say but have difficulty getting their speech plans to the muscle system, causing sounds to come out wrong,"" Katz said. ""My original inspiration was to show patients their tongues, which would clearly show where sounds should and should not be articulated,"" he said. Technology recently allowed researchers to switch from 2D technology to the Opti-Speech technology, which shows the 3D images of the tongue. A previous UT Dallas research project determined that the Opti-Speech visual feedback system can reliably provide real-time feedback for speech learning. Part of the new study looked at an effect called compensatory articulation when acoustics are rapidly shifted and subjects think they are making a certain sound with their mouths, but hear feedback that indicates they are making a different sound. Katz said people will instantaneously shift away from the direction that the sound has pushed them. Then, if the shift is turned off, they'll overshoot. ""In our paradigm, we were able to visually shift people. Their tongues were making one sound but, little by little, we start shifting it,"" Katz said. ""People changed their sounds to match the tongue image."" Katz said the research results highlight the importance of body visualization as part of rehabilitation therapy, saying there is much more work to be done. ""We want to determine why visual feedback affects speech,"" Katz said. ""How much is due to compensating, versus mirroring (or entrainment)? Do some of the results come from people visually guiding their tongue to the right place, then having their sense of 'mouth feel' take over? What parts of the brain are likely involved?

With some training and selective food reinforcement, pigeons performed as well as humans in categorizing digitized slides and mammograms of benign and malignant human breast tissue, the researchers found. The pigeons were able to generalize what they had learned, so that when the researchers showed them a completely new set of normal and cancerous digitized slides, they correctly identified them. Their accuracy, like that of humans, was modestly affected by the presence or absence of color in the images, as well as by degrees of image compression. The pigeons also learned to correctly identify cancer-relevant micro calcifications on mammograms, but they had a tougher time classifying suspicious masses on mammograms a task considered difficult even for skilled human observers, the authors noted in the paper, published in the journal PLOS One. ""These results go a long way toward establishing a profound link between humans and our animal kin,"" said Edward Wasserman, professor of psychological and brain sciences at the UI and study co-author. ""Even distant relatives like people and pigeons are adept at perceiving and categorizing the complex visual patterns that are presented in pathology and radiology images, surely a task for which nature has not specifically prepared us."" The pigeons' successes and difficulties provide a window into how physicians process visual cues present on slides and x-rays to diagnose and classify disease risk. This work also suggests that pigeons' remarkable ability to discriminate between complex visual images could be put to good use as trained medical image observers, to help researchers explore image quality and the impact of color, contrast, brightness, and image compression artifacts on diagnostic performance. Although a pigeon's brain is no bigger than the tip of an index finger, it turns out that the neural pathways involved, including the basal ganglia and cortical-striatal synapses, operate in ways very similar to those at work in the human brain. According to Wasserman, the common pigeon (Columba livia) has a tremendous capacity to discriminate and categorize a wide range of objects and images. ""Research over the past 50 years has shown that pigeons can distinguish identities and emotional expressions on human faces, letters of the alphabet, misshapen pharmaceutical capsules, and even paintings by Monet vs. Picasso,"" Wasserman said. ""Their visual memory is equally impressive, with a proven recall of more than 1,800 images."" The collaboration began when study co-author Richard Levenson at UC Davis learned about Wasserman's earlier research on visual short-term memory capacity of pigeons and people. Levenson wondered how pigeons would perform on pathology slides. For the study, each pigeon learned to discriminate cancerous from non-cancerous images and slides using traditional ""operant conditioning,"" a technique in which a bird was rewarded only when a correct selection was made; incorrect selections were not rewarded and prompted correction trials. Training with stained pathology slides included a large set of benign and cancerous samples from routine cases at UC Davis Medical Center. Some birds, for example, first learned to recognize benign or malignant samples in full color at low magnification (4X) and then progressed to medium (10X) and high (20X) magnifications. They also were tested using monochrome samples to eliminate color and brightness as potential cues, as well as samples with different levels of image compression, a procedure commonly used to reduce the size of digital data sets. To rule out the possibility that the birds were relying on rote memorization on the tests, brand-new samples were presented and food was dispensed regardless of whether the pigeons made a correct selection. And, indeed, the pigeons performed virtually as well on images that they had never been shown before, indicating that they had, in an extremely narrow sense, learned pathology. ""The birds were remarkably adept at discriminating between benign and malignant breast cancer slides at all magnifications, a task that can perplex inexperienced human observers, who typically require considerable training to attain mastery,"" said Levenson, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at UC Davis Health System . ""Pigeons' accuracy from day one of training at low magnification increased from 50 percent correct to nearly 85 percent correct at days 13 to 15."" Wasserman, who has conducted studies on pigeons for over 40 years, found the pigeons especially adept at discerning pathology slides. ""The pigeons learned to discriminate benign from cancerous slides as fast in this research as in any other study we've conducted on pigeons in our laboratory,"" Wasserman said. ""In fact, when we showed a cohort of four birds a set of uncompressed images, an approach known as ""flock-sourcing,"" the group's accuracy level reached an amazing 99 percent correct, higher than that achieved by any of the four individual birds."" For the mammogram study, the birds were trained to detect images with and without microcalcifications and to discriminate the presence of malignancy in breast masses using a similar process. Their accuracy averaged 84 percent for images with microcalcifications that they had been trained upon, and 72 percent for novel images a level of performance on par with human radiologists and radiology residents who were given the same cases to review. The birds, however, had difficulty evaluating the malignant potential of breast masses (without microcalcifications) detected on mammograms, a task the authors acknowledge as ""very challenging."" Human radiologists achieved an accuracy rate of about 80 percent when viewing images of the relatively subtle masses used in this study. But, the pigeons took many weeks instead of days that they had needed to master the histopathology tasks to learn to classify the breast masses in the mammogram training set. More strikingly, after the training phase, when they were finally shown novel, previously unseen images, the birds utterly failed to perform at a level better than chance. ""The data suggest that the birds were just memorizing the masses in the training set, and never learned how to key in on stellate margins and other features of the lesions that can correlate with malignancy,"" Levenson said. ""But, as this task reflects the difficulty even humans have, it indicates how pigeons may be faithful mimics of the strengths and weaknesses of humans in viewing medical images."" After years of education and training, physicians can sometimes struggle with the interpretation of microscope slides and mammograms. Levenson, a pathologist who studies artificial intelligence for image analysis and other applications in biology and medicine, believes there is considerable room for enhancing the process. ""While new technologies are constantly being designed to enhance image acquisition, processing, and display, these potential advances need to be validated using trained observers to monitor quality and reliability,"" Levenson said. ""This is a difficult, time-consuming, and expensive process that requires the recruitment of clinicians as subjects for these relatively mundane tasks. ""Pigeons' sensitivity to diagnostically salient features in medical images suggest that they can provide reliable feedback on many variables at play in the production, manipulation, and viewing of these diagnostically crucial tools, and can assist researchers and engineers as they continue to innovate.""

Published in the journal AIDS Care, functional MRI (fMRI) scans, taken while participants were performing an alternating face-gender/word-semantic task, revealed that HIV-positive individuals in the study showed deficits in cognitive functioning, compared to an age matched HIV-negative controls. Despite advances in treatment, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, or HAND, remains one of most common disorders in individuals diagnosed with HIV. Previous studies have suggested about 30 to 60 percent of individuals with HIV are affected, says neuroscientist Xiong Jiang, PhD, the lead author of the new study. This study suggests that cognitive impairments in those individuals with HIV aged 50 years or older might be even more prevalent than previously proposed.  This could be due to the fact that some standard neuropsychology tests might be insensitive to HAND,  says Jiang. The new study used an experimental design that has been validated to study cognitive control (the ability to guide thought and action in accordance with current goals in a given environment) in healthy younger adults. During the scanning, the participants were cued (unpredictably) to judge the gender of the face (male versus female) or the meaning of the word (e.g., animate for  tiger  and inanimate for  table ) on superimposed face-word images. A switch (after the cue) in task often leads to an increase in reaction time and a decrease in accuracy (known as switching cost). The HIV-positive group was significantly slower in adjusting to change in tasks, which correlates with brain dysfunctions in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), one of the key executive regions. This collar-shaped area is near the front of the brain, and damage to this region has been linked to many cognitive impairments, including executive deficits and apathy.  Intriguingly, both impairments are highly prevalent in individuals with HIV-infection, suggesting dACC might be one of commonly affected brain regions in HIV and a potential neural target for therapies,  says Jiang.  These findings, although preliminary, could have a significant implication for public health,  says Jiang,  While there is no proven treatment that can effectively treat HAND other than control HIV replication, it is important for caregivers, families and the individuals themselves to know if they are affected.  Jiang says he will now study HAND in a larger population research supported by a $2 million grant from the National Institute of Mental Health to further develop his fMRI-based biomarkers with the potential to guide and evaluate early and targeted therapies.

By the time the batter sees the ball s position, plans his swing and moves the bat, the ball will be firmly in the catcher s mitt. This time lag is known as sensorimotor delay. University of Louisville (UofL) researcher Bart Borghuis, PhD, has increased our understanding of how people and animals deal with this delay in day-to-day interactions by analyzing the hunting skills of salamanders. A skilled baseball player compensates for sensorimotor delay by predicting when the ball will cross the plate and starting his swing in time to meet it. Borghuis  research reveals the salamander also predicts the future location of its prey as it catches moving fruit flies by projecting its long, sticky tongue. The sensorimotor delay is caused by the time it takes for the visual image to be processed by the retina, time to plan the motor action and time to activate the motion. When a salamander hopes to catch a moving fly, in the time it takes to make the strike about 230 milliseconds the fly will have moved from the location it was in when the salamander launched its attack. If the salamander sends its tongue to the location where it sees the fly, by the time the tongue gets there, the fly will be gone. Despite this delay, salamanders are efficient hunters, catching their prey more than 90 percent of the time in Borghuis  experiments. Borghuis, assistant professor in the Department of Anatomical Sciences and Neurobiology at UofL, and Anthony Leonardo, PhD, of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, used high speed videography to capture 270 instances of salamanders striking at flies. Through analysis of the videos, Borghuis developed an algorithm that predicted where the salamander s tongue would strike based on the fly s path. The algorithm mimics the salamanders  process using extrapolation to anticipate the prey s position in the future based on its bearing and velocity. The salamanders  tongue strikes were consistent with the algorithm, and were consistently successful unless the fly changed course between the time the salamander initiated the attack and the time of the actual strike. In successful strikes, the salamander caught the fly by sending its tongue tip to the position where the fly was when the tongue arrived. When the salamanders missed, the salamander s tongue struck the location where the fly would have been had it continued on the same path it had been following. However, in these cases, the fly had changed direction after the salamander launched its attack.  The misses confirmed the model,  Borghuis said.  This is the first demonstration that the salamanders were making a prediction.  The tongue struck where the fly never had been, yet would have been had the fly continued its previous course of motion. Thus the salamander was predicting where the fly would be at the time the tongue reached it based on the fly s direction and speed.  This information adds to a small set of clear examples of how vertebrates including humans use prediction for dealing with delays in motor processing,  Borghuis said.  Now that we know how the salamander does this, we can further investigate the neuromechanisms that make this happen.

Founded in 1990, the Collegiate Inventors Competition attracts submissions from undergraduate and graduate students who have developed potentially commercializable products in the course of research. In partnership with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the competition is designed to encourage innovation, entrepreneurship, and creativity with the lure of more than $100,000 in prizes.  Our eye-on-a-chip addresses one of the most critical issues in health research: a lack of effective preclinical models for disease modeling,  says Seo.  Our device has applications in many industries, ranging from pharmaceutical development to consumer product toxicity screening.

Huh s research involves developing synthetic substitutes for biological systems, otherwise known as organ-on-a-chip devices. These small plastic chips contain microfluidic channels, carefully designed so that human cells can grow in them in a way that simulates the three-dimensional environments they would normally inhabit in the body.

Proceeds from the financing will be used to advance regulatory clearance for the company s lead oncology diagnostic program, TR(ACE)  assay, and for general working capital purposes. Biological Dynamics has pioneered the use of alternating current electrokinetics (ACE) technology in the field of molecular diagnostics. The company s ACE lab-on-chip (LOC) platform isolates nanoparticles from high conductance physiological solutions such as whole blood, plasma, and serum directly without the need for dilution and with minimal hands-on time. The direct-to-analyte approach allows the company to develop minimally invasive and simple-to-perform diagnostic tests that detect cell-free DNA, exosomes, and other cellular debris from 250uL in less than 30 minutes.  The company s first product, theTR(ACE)  assay, utilizes the platform to assess treatment response in oncology.  We are grateful for the enthusiastic response from our new institutional investor and the continued support from our existing ones,  said Raj Krishnan, CEO of Biological Dynamics.  Treatment response monitoring (TRM) is a key piece of patient care. We believe TR(ACE)  will resolve many limitations of existing TRM toolsets, enabling doctors and patients to navigate cancer care with greater clarity. The new funding will help us to execute on our regulatory strategy and to bring TR(ACE)  to the clinic.  Annually, the global community spends over $100B on oncology drugs alone. Oncologists typically have a short (12-18 months) window of chemo-tolerability during which they can make informed decisions as to whether a patient should be switched to another therapy. Therefore, it is essential for physicians to be able to distinguish benefiting and non-benefiting patients early in the treatment process. Biological Dynamics  goal is to bring TR(ACE)  to the clinic and thereby enable physicians, patients, and payors to navigate cancer care more effectively, built from a clear understanding of whether a cancer treatment - regardless of its cost or complexity   is working for a specific patient.","Published: November 19, 2015"

The discovery also makes it possible to produce chips with additional functions for mobile devices, computers and other applications. The researchers  findings was published today in Nanotechnology, the leading journal of the British Institute of Physics.   The conventional method for manufacturing 3D nanostructures consists of stacking layers on a silicon chip. The first step is to write (or define) a pattern in the photoresist, using a mask and UV light. The etching or deposition of material in the layer then provides the desired shape. Dozens of layers are stacked to produce the chips themselves. This is a laborious process with limitations. There are restrictions on the number of layers that can be stacked, since layers that are relatively far apart can become randomly displaced with respect to one another, interfering with the chip s functionality. Single ProcessThe new method makes it possible to define a 3D nanostructure on a chip in a single process. Researchers from the University of Twente s MESA+ institute have developed a special 3D mask that can define the structure on two sides of the wafer simultaneously. This ensures that both sides of the chip are neatly aligned, thereby guaranteeing the vertical alignment of the final three-dimensional nanostructure. Mass ProductionThe method opens the way for the mass production of chips in which various functionalities are positioned close together. In collaboration with ASML and TNO, the researchers are investigating ways of implementing this new technology in practice. There are possible applications in the medical world, for example by combining an optical sensor for proteins with a data processing chip and a magnetic memory.  Our method makes it possible to combine an endless variety of features on a chip, such as electronics, optics, magnets and microfluidics,  explains Professor Willem Vos of the Complex Photonic Systems group (COPS) at MESA+.  Trapping LightThe researchers Diana Grishina, Cock Harteveld, and Willem Vos of COPS and L on Woldering of Transducer Science and Technology (TST) at MESA+ discovered the method while working to develop new types of photonic crystals. They have succeeded in trapping light in crystals with embedded cavities and to control the direction in which the light travels.

Blood samples for the study were collected from a broad geographic area   Canada, Philadelphia and Atlanta. While the set of biomarkers reported in this study are the most accurate reported thus far for early-stage ovarian cancer, more extensive testing across a larger population will be needed to determine if the high diagnostic accuracy will be maintained across a larger group of women representing a diversity of ethnic and racial groups. The research was reported November 17 in the journal Scientific Reports, an open access journal from the publishers of Nature.  This work provides a proof of concept that using an integrated approach combining analytical chemistry and learning algorithms may be a way to identify optimal diagnostic features,  said John McDonald, a professor in the School of Biology at the Georgia Institute of Technology and director of its Integrated Cancer Research Center.  We think our results show great promise and we plan to further validate our findings across much larger samples.  Ovarian cancer has been difficult to treat because it typically is not diagnosed until after it has metastasized to other areas of the body. Researchers have been seeking a routine screening test that could diagnose the disease in stage one or stage two   when the cancer is confined to the ovaries. Working with three cancer treatment centers in the U.S. and Canada, the Georgia Tech researchers obtained blood samples from women with stage one and stage two ovarian cancer. They separated out the serum, which contains proteins and metabolites   molecules produced by enzymatic reactions in the body. The serum samples were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS), which is two instruments joined together to better separate samples into their individual components. Heavier molecules are separated from lighter molecules, and the molecular signatures are determined with enough accuracy to identify the specific compounds. The Georgia Tech researchers decided to look only at the metabolites in their research.  People have been looking at proteins for diagnosis of ovarian cancer for a couple of decades, and the results have not been very impressive,  said Facundo Fern ndez, a professor in Georgia Tech s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry who led the analytical chemistry part of the research.  We decided to look in a different place for molecules that could potentially provide diagnostic capabilities. It s one of the places that people had really not studied before.  Samples from each of the 46 cancer patients were divided so they could be analyzed in duplicate. The researchers also looked at serum samples from 49 women who did not have cancer. The work required eliminating unrelated compounds such as caffeine, and molecules that were not present in all the cancer patients.  We used really high resolution equipment and instrumentation to be able to separate most of the components of the samples,  Fern ndez explained.  Otherwise, detection of early-stage ovarian cancer is very difficult because you have a lot of confounding factors.  The chemical work identified about a thousand candidate compounds. That number was reduced to about 255 through the work of research scientist David Gaul, who removed duplicates and unrelated molecules from the collection. These 255 compounds were then analyzed by a learning algorithm which evaluated the predictive value of each one. Molecules that did not contribute to the predictive accuracy of the screening were eliminated. Ultimately, the algorithm produced a list of 16 molecules that together differentiated cancer patients with extremely high accuracy   greater than 90 percent.  The algorithm looks at the metabolic features and correlates them with whether the samples were from cancer or control patients,  McDonald explained.  The algorithm has no idea what these compounds are. It is simply looking for the combination of molecules that provides the optimal predictive accuracy. What is encouraging is that many of the diagnostic features identified are metabolites that have been previously implicated in ovarian cancer.  As a next step, McDonald and Fern ndez would like to study samples from a larger population that includes significant numbers of different ethnic and racial groups. Those individuals may have different metabolites that could serve as biomarkers for ovarian cancer. Though sophisticated laboratory equipment was required to identify the 16 molecules, a screening test would not require the same level of sophistication, Fern ndez said.  Once you know what these molecules are, the next step would be to set up a clinical assay,  he said.  Mass spectrometry is a common tool in this field. We could use a clinical mass spectrometer to look at only the molecules we are interested in. Moving this to a clinical assay would take work, but I don t see any technical barriers to doing it.  The Fern ndez and McDonald groups have used a similar approach with prostate cancer and plan to explore its utility for detecting other types of cancer.","Published: November 19, 2015"

The key to the new method s improved performance is its ability to compare data to so-called spectral libraries--essentially a pattern-matching exercise--rather than individual spectra or a database of sequences. The team describes their results in the Nov. 9 issue of Nature Methods.  You can integrate our method with existing pipelines to increase performance by up to three- to four-fold,  said Nuno Bandeira, a professor at the Jacobs School of Engineering and the Skaggs School of Pharmacy at UC San Diego, the study s senior author. The advance is particularly important because many research teams are now switching to an approach known as data-independent acquisition, which captures a wealth of raw data instead of running data analysis on a few elements at random, (selected from a distribution based on peptide intensities). The amount of data collected has created a bottleneck for existing computational tools.  We needed a new data analysis method,  said Bandeira. Bandeira s research group focuses on building spectral network algorithms, which analyze pairs of overlapping peptides spectra produced during mass spectrometry experiments. The spectra are produced when an enzyme digests proteins, breaking them down into subcomponents, including peptides.  The algorithms detect patterns that the pairs have in common and then look for these patterns in other spectra. This considerably speeds up the process of identifying peptides and by extension, proteins. Traditional methods compare spectra either against databases or against spectra that have already been identified. In the Nature Methods study, researchers showed that they were able to identify twice as many peptides in human samples when compared to traditional methods. They also observed 40 percent more protein-on-protein interactions.  The results are more stable and easier to reproduce  when compared to traditional methods, Bandeira said. Next steps include speeding up the process, which takes roughly twice as long as traditional methods. The method also will have to be fine-tuned for the next generation of mass spectrometers.  We also want to start seeing how we can capitalize on this to analyze a full cohort of data,  Bandeira said.

The findings may have applications in satellite remote sensing, biomedical imaging, cancer detection, and computer data storage. Dr Yakir Gagnon, Professor Justin Marshall and colleagues previously showed that mantis shrimp (Gonodactylaceus falcatus) can reflect and detect circular polarizing light, an ability extremely rare in nature. Until now, no-one has known what they use it for. The new study shows the shrimp use circular polarization as a means to covertly advertise their presence to aggressive competitors.  In birds, colour is what we re familiar with and in the ocean, reef fish display with colour this is a form of communication we understand. What we re now discovering is there s a completely new language of communication,  said Professor Marshall. Linear polarized light is seen only in one plane, whereas circular polarized light travels in a spiral clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. Humans cannot perceive polarized light without the help of special lenses, often found in sunglasses. ""We've determined that a mantis shrimp displays circular polarized patterns on its body, particularly on its legs, head and heavily armoured tail,"" he said. ""These are the regions most visible when it curls up during conflict.""  These shrimps live in holes in the reef,  said Professor Marshall.  They like to hide away; they re secretive and don t like to be in the open.  They are also  very violent , Professor Marshall adds.  They re nasty animals. They re called mantis shrimps because they have a pair of legs at the front used to catch their prey, but 40 times faster than the preying mantis. They can pack a punch like a .22 calibre bullet and can break aquarium glass. Other mantis shrimp know this and are very cautious on the reef.  Researchers dropped a mantis shrimp into a tank with two burrows to hide in: one reflecting unpolarized light and the other, circular polarized light. The shrimps chose the unpolarized burrow 68 per cent of the time suggesting the circular polarized burrow was perceived as being occupied by another mantis shrimp.  If you essentially label holes with circular polarizing light, by shining circular polarizing light out of them, shrimps won t go near it,  said Professor Marshall.  They know or they think they know there s another shrimp there. The findings may help doctors to better detect cancer.  Cancerous cells do not reflect polarized light, in particular circular polarizing light, in the same way as healthy cells,  said Professor Marshall. Cameras equipped with circular polarizing sensors may detect cancer cells long before the human eye can see them. Another study involving Professor Marshall, published in the same edition of Current Biology, showed that linear polarized light is used as a form of communication by fiddler crabs. Fiddler crabs (Uca stenodactylus) live on mudflats, a very reflective environment, and they behave differently depending on the amount of polarization reflected by objects, the researchers found.  It appears that fiddler crabs have evolved inbuilt sunglasses, in the same way as we use polarizing sunglasses to reduce glare,  Professor Marshall said. The crabs were able to detect and identify ground-base objects base on how much polarized light was reflected. They either moved forward in a mating stance, or retreated back into their holes, at varying speeds.  These animals are dealing in a currency of polarization that is completely invisible to humans,  Professor Marshall said.  It s all part of this new story on the language of polarization.

The journal Developmental Science has published the research, showing that babies can make transitive inferences about a social hierarchy of dominance. ""We found that within the first year of life, children can engage in this type of logical reasoning, which was previously thought to be beyond their reach until the age of about four or five years,"" says Stella Lourenco, the Emory University psychologist who led the study. The researchers designed a non-verbal experiment using puppet characters. The experiment created scenarios among the puppets to test transitive inference, or the ability to deduce which character should dominate another character, even when the babies had not seen the two characters directly interact with one another. A majority of the babies in the experiment, who were ages 10 to 13 months, showed a pattern consistent with transitive inference. ""Everybody knows that babies learn rapidly, like little sponges that soak in incredible amounts of knowledge,"" Lourenco says. ""This findings tells us about how humans learn. If you can reason deductively, you can make generalizations without having to experience the world directly. This ability could be a crucial tool for making sense of the social relationships around us, and perhaps complex non-social interactions."" During the 1960s, developmental psychologist Jean Piaget showed that children could solve transitive inference problems around the age of seven or eight. For example, if you know that Paul is taller than Mary, and that Mary is taller than Jack, then you can infer indirectly that Paul must be taller than Jack. You don't need to see Paul and Jack standing side-by-side to draw this conclusion. For years, the prevailing philosophy in cognitive psychology was that children younger than seven were mostly illogical and incapable of transitive inference. Then, during the late 1970s, researchers found that by reducing the complexity of transitive inference problems, children as young as four could solve them. Lourenco, whose research has shown that babies have numerical reasoning and can understand relationships of magnitude, suspected that infants were also capable of transitive inference. For the current study, Lourenco teamed up with co-authors Robert Hampton, an Emory psychologist whose lab at Yerkes National Primate Research Center has demonstrated that monkeys can engage in transitive inference, and Regina Paxton Gazes, a former graduate student in the Hampton lab and post-doctoral fellow at Zoo Atlanta. Gazes, who is now on the psychology faculty at Bucknell University, designed the non-verbal experiments for the human infants. In the first experiment, the babies were shown a video of three puppets arranged in a row. The puppets an elephant, a bear and a hippopotamus, were similar in size but arranged in a left to right social hierarchy. The elephant is holding a toy, but the bear reaches over and forcibly takes the toy from the elephant. Next, the hippopotamus takes the toy from the bear. These scenarios suggested that the bear is more dominant than the elephant, and the hippo is more dominant than the bear. Finally, the babies were shown a scenario where the elephant takes the toy from the hippo. This scenario held the gaze of most the babies in the experiment for longer than the other scenarios. ""Dominance by the elephant violates the expected transitive-inference relationship, since the bear took the toy from the elephant and the hippo took the toy from the bear,"" Lourenco explains. ""The babies look longer and pay greater attention to the scenario that violates the transitive inference as they try to figure out why it is different from what they would have predicted."" In a second experiment, the researchers introduced a fourth character, a giraffe, that had not yet interacted with the others in the familiarization phase. The giraffe was novel and had not previously displayed dominance behavior. The infants did not pay more attention to scenarios involving the giraffe, whether or not it displayed dominance. The researchers also conducted control experiments with infants. For the controls, the hippo always displayed dominant behavior and the elephant always displayed subordinate behavior. The data supported that the majority of the infants who were shown unexpected dominance behaviors, or 23 out of 32, were engaging in transitive inference when they gazed at scenarios of unexpected behavior by the puppets, compared to other scenarios. The researchers hypothesize that transitive inference for social dominance is evolutionarily important, so the mechanisms to support this type of logical reasoning are in place early. ""It's remarkable that the infants could make these inferences about social dominance with minimal presentation,"" Gazes says. ""It suggests an early emerging, and perhaps evolutionary ancient ability, that is shared with other animals."" In addition to exploring important science questions about how the mind develops, the findings could aid in determining whether infants are on track in the learning process. ""Since a majority of babies show the ability to engage in this kind of logical problem solving, our paradigm could certainly become an important tool for assessing normative cognitive development,"" Lourenco says.

Led by Professor Sonia Lupien, the team found that having more than 300 Facebook friends increased teens' levels of cortisol. On the other hand, teens who act in ways that support their Facebook friends for example, by liking what they posted or sending them words of encouragement -- decreased their levels of cortisol. Their findings were published in Psychoneuroendocrinology. Lupien and her colleagues recruited 88 participants aged 12-17 years who were asked about their frequency of use of Facebook, their number of friends on the social media site, their self-promoting behaviour, and finally, the supporting behaviour they displayed toward their friends. Along with these four measures, the team collected cortisol samples of the participating adolescents. The samples were taken four times a day for three days. Stress levels measured in adolescents from cortisol samples are obviously not entirely due to the popular social media site. ""While other important external factors are also responsible, we estimated that the isolated effect of Facebook on cortisol was around eight percent,"" Lupien said. ""We were able to show that beyond 300 Facebook friends, adolescents showed higher cortisol levels; we can therefore imagine that those who have 1,000 or 2,000 friends on Facebook may be subjected to even greater stress."" Other studies have shown that high morning cortisol levels at 13 years increase the risk of suffering from depression at 16 years by 37%. While none of the adolescents suffered from depression at the time of the study, Lupien could not conclude that they were free from an increased risk of developing it. ""We did not observe depression in our participants. However, adolescents who present high stress hormone levels do not become depressed immediately; it can occur later on,"" Lupien said. ""Some studies have shown that it may take 11 years before the onset of severe depression in children who consistently had high cortisol levels."" The study is one of the first in the emerging field of cyberpsychology to focus on the effects of Facebook on well-being. ""The preliminary nature of our findings will require refined measurement of Facebook behaviors in relation to physiological functioning and we will need to undertake future studies to determine whether these effects exist in younger children and adults,"" Lupien said.

Their work is published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry.  Our achievement opens up a realistic avenue towards a novel medicine for narcoleptic patients. Immediately after our paper was published online, a narcoleptic patient in the US emailed us a letter of appreciation, which gave us further motivation to tackle this difficult technical challenge. We will make our best effort to keep optimizing the compound so that we will be able to provide a cure for narcolepsy in the near future.  Nagase says. The compound works to mimic the action of a wake-promoting substance in our brain called  orexin.  Orexin, discovered in 1998 by Yanagisawa, is a neuropeptide that plays a central role in maintaining wakefulness. Its deficiency causes a serious sleep disorder called narcolepsy, in which patients experience excessive daytime sleepiness, often falling asleep uncontrollably. Patients also suffer from symptoms such as cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by emotion), vivid hallucinations when going into or out of sleep, and sleep paralysis. Orexin itself is proven to be effective in improving narcoleptic symptoms in model animals, but it cannot be readily used as a medicine because the blood-brain barrier prevents it from entering the brain, where orexin works by binding to its receptors. Instead, a small molecule mimicking orexin (orexin receptor agonist) should be useful as a therapeutic agent for narcolepsy. Nagase and his colleagues designed and synthesized more than 2,000 compounds, and eventually discovered the first non-peptidic orexin receptor agonist, YNT-185. Giving YNT-185 to normal mice strongly promoted wakefulness. Moreover, YNT-185, when given to narcoleptic model mice, significantly ameliorated the symptom (unpublished data). This achievement is an important first step for development of a novel medicine to correct the fundamental disease mechanism of narcolepsy. University of Tsukuba   press release Nagahara T et al.

New research presented at the American Physiological Society's conference, Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolic Diseases: Physiology and Gender suggests that the difference in risk may be due to the presence of the male sex hormone testosterone. Parkinson s is due to the loss of dopamine neurons, cells in the region of the brain that controls movement. Oxidative stress, which is a chemical imbalance triggered by sources such as genetic mutations and exposure to environmental toxins, can harm and kill cells. Researchers at the University of North Texas Health Science Center observed in rats  dopamine neurons that testosterone exacerbated damage induced by oxidative stress, acting through a protein called cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). Blocking the actions of COX2 blocked testosterone s effects. These data indicate that testosterone may enhance the damage and death in dopamine neurons induced by oxidative stress, explaining the sex differences in the occurrence of Parkinson s, the researchers wrote.

The ultimate goal is to better understand how the billions of neurons in the brain communicate with one another during normal brain function or dysfunction as result of injury or disease. ""There is tremendous interest in mapping all the neuron connections in the human brain,"" said Dr. James Delehanty, research biologist, Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering. ""To do that we need new tools or materials that allow us to see how large groups of neurons communicate with one another while, at the same time, being able to focus in on a single neuron's activity. Our most recent work potentially opens the integration of voltage-sensitive nanomaterials into live cells and tissues in a variety of configurations to achieve real-time imaging capabilities not currently possible."" The basis of neuron communication is the time-dependent modulation of the strength of the electric field that is maintained across the cell's plasma membrane. This is called an action potential. Among the nanomaterials under consideration for application in neuronal action potential imaging are quantum dots (QDs) crystalline semiconductor nanomaterials possessing a number of advantageous photophysical attributes. ""QDs are very bright and photostable so you can look at them for long times and they allow for tissue imaging configurations that are not compatible with current materials, for example, organic dyes,"" Delehanty added. ""Equally important, we've shown here that QD brightness tracks, with very high fidelity, the time-resolved electric field strength changes that occur when a neuron undergoes an action potential. Their nanoscale size make them ideal nanoscale voltage sensing materials for interfacing with neurons and other electrically active cells for voltage sensing."" QDs are small, bright, photo-stable materials that possess nanosecond fluorescence lifetimes. They can be localized within or on cellular plasma membranes and have low cytotoxicity when interfaced with experimental brain systems. Additionally, QDs possess two-photon action cross-section orders of magnitude larger than organic dyes or fluorescent proteins. Two-photon imaging is the preferred imaging modality for imaging deep (millimeters) into the brain and other tissues of the body. In their most recent work, the NRL researchers showed that an electric field typical of those found in neuronal membranes results in suppression of the QD photoluminescence (PL) and, for the first time, that QD PL is able to track the action potential profile of a firing neuron with millisecond time resolution. This effect is shown to be connected with electric-field-driven QD ionization and consequent QD PL quenching, in contradiction with conventional wisdom that suppression of the QD PL is attributable to the quantum confined Stark effect the shifting and splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to presence of an external electric field. ""The inherent superior photostability properties of QDs coupled with their voltage sensitivity could prove advantageous to long-term imaging capabilities that are not currently attainable using traditional organic voltage sensitive dyes,"" Delehanty said.

A second paper to be published on the same day in the journal eLife, led by Harvard Medical School, shows how three proteins regulate chemical messengers that are key to autism spectrum disorders and syndromes such as Down's and Rett syndrome. ""Understanding fundamental changes in the brain that could lead to intellectual disabilities may one day help in the development of better treatments,"" says Megan Williams, lead author on the Kirrel3 study. About one in 68 children are identified with autism spectrum disorder in the US and about one in six children had a developmental disability of some kind in 2006-2008. In the UK, 1.1% of the population may have autism, equating to around 700,000 people. Variations to the Kirrel3 gene are known to be associated with intellectual disability, autism, and Jacobsen syndrome, a rare developmental disorder that often includes intellectual disabilities. Because of this strong association, the University of Utah team investigated how changes to Kirrel3 impair brain circuits critical for memory and learning. Any cognitive task, from learning a new skill, having a conversation or driving to work requires the neurons of our brains to talk to each other. They are linked by connections called synapses that transmit these messages from one neuron to the next. Each neuron makes multiple synapses allowing it to send and receive information to many neurons within a large network. The study shows that Kirrel3 helps form part of a large synaptic structure called the mossy fiber synapse that is located in the hippocampus, a major region of the brain required for learning and memory. In developing mice that don't have Kirrel3, the mossy fiber synapse becomes malformed, causing the hippocampus to become overactive. ""Our work shows how even very small changes to synapses can alter brain function and could lead to intellectual disabilities,"" says Williams. ""In addition to being in the hippocampus, the gene is also expressed in other parts of the brain. It is possible that defects in those regions may also contribute to the neurodevelopmental disorders associated with Kirrel3."" Changes in the activity of synapses are thought to play an important role in the physical changes to the brain found in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Both synapses that inhibit and excite the stimulation of nerves are important to normal function and an imbalance between them can cause dysfunction. Decreased inhibition is implicated in autism spectrum disorders, whereas excess inhibition has been proposed to occur in mental retardation syndromes, such as Down's and Rett Syndromes. The team led by Harvard Medical School propose that mutations in the proteins Neurixin, Neuroligin and CASK may have a direct impact on chemical messengers that reduce the activity of neurons.

Owlstone s chemical detection technology is being developed to measure the trace chemicals present in the breath of lung cancer patients. The quick and easy to use breath test technology has the potential to detect cases earlier, and allow more effective and less expensive treatments. The project estimates it will save the NHS  82m each year. Inotec AMD is developing an oxygen therapy device for non-healing diabetic foot ulcers. Diabetic foot ulceration currently costs the NHS around  540m per year. In the UK, and globally, there is an epidemic of diabetes and these costs are set to spiral upwards rapidly in the coming years. This continuous day and night treatment can be used to heal or reduce the size of diabetic ulcers whilst the patient carries on with normal life.  The two Cambridge-based companies have benefitted from reforms made in Brussels and championed by Vicky Ford, which have enabled small companies to co-develop solutions for large public sector buyers such as the NHS. Both technologies have been developed with support from SBRI Healthcare funding. Vicky Ford said,  This breath test is effective and cost effective and is a credit to the scientists involved. Also deserving much praise are the local NHS staff who are determined to improve cancer detection and are seeking new solutions to assist their cause. So much innovation comes from small companies which is why I worked for rule change and these projects I believe are just the start of what can be done.  Karen Livingstone, Director of Strategic Partnerships and Industry Engagement for the Eastern AHSN (the organisation with the responsibility for innovation and best practice adoption across the NHS in the east) commented:  The NHS knows it can improve outcomes for patients through the use of new technologies and innovations.  Through the SBRI Healthcare programme we are able to fund the development of new technologies to address known needs. The SBRI Healthcare programme was initially funded with EU support but we have grown this Eastern success story into a national award winning programme.  Eastern AHSN is supporting these companies to complete the development of their products and see their introduction into the NHS to improve patient care. In addition to enhanced health outcomes we will also see economic value and jobs brought to the eastern region as a consequence of this work. ","Published: November 18, 2015"

In addition, a number of the target experimental structures were predicted to be the most stable form. Participants in the blind test were invited to predict the full three-dimensional crystal structures of five previously unpublished compounds, starting solely from the chemical diagram and basic crystallization conditions. The participants came from a record number of 25 different groups, spread over 14 countries (Argentina, Austria, Canada, China, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, UAE, UK, and USA). The subjects of the test included a co-crystal, a large flexible molecule, a salt hydrate, and a drug molecule with five known but unpublished polymorphs; the drug molecule was released by a major pharmaceutical company especially for the blind test. The inclusion of the polymorphic drug molecule for the first time highlighted the value of crystal structure prediction-derived knowledge for identifying polymorph issues and opportunities for molecules of commercial importance. The salt hydrate is the first three-component system in the blind test, and potentially one of the hardest to predict, to date.  Overall the target structures in this blind test were significantly harder than for previous tests,  commented Colin Groom, Executive Director of the CCDC.  So the results this year are especially impressive.  The increased participation and breadth of methods adopted underline the importance of crystal structure prediction methods, in particular for pharmaceutical R&D.  Professor Richard Cooper, Oxford University, who selected the target systems for the blind test added,  These targets were not model systems but were selected to represent real-life challenges. The remarkable results of this blind test demonstrate the huge potential of crystal structure prediction methods for informing experimental solid-state chemistry.  A paper detailing the full results of the blind test will be published as part of a special issue on organic crystal structure prediction of the International Union of Crystallography journal, Acta Cryst.

This new look at MOFs led to a discovery that holds promise for the improved design of MOFs tailored specifically for carbon capture, or for the use of hydrogen and natural gas (methane) fuels.  Up to this point we have been shooting in the dark in our designing of MOFs without really understanding the fundamental reasons for why one MOF is better than another,  says Yaghi.  Our new study expands our view and thinking about MOFs by introducing gas-gas interactions and their organization into superlattices that are a major factor in achieving high storage capacity for gases.  Yaghi, who invented MOFs in the early 1990s while at the Arizona State University, is now a faculty scientist with Berkeley Lab s Materials Sciences Division and the University of California (UC) Berkeley Chemistry Department, where he also serves as co-director of the Kavli Energy NanoScience Institute (Kavli-ENSI). For this latest study, Yaghi and Osamu Terasaki, a chemist with Stockholm University, along with collaborators from institutes in the United States, China, South Korea and Saudi Arabia, interfaced a gas adsorption apparatus with a form of X-ray crystallography, called in-situ small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The result was a gas adsorption crystallography technique that uncovered evidence of cooperative interactions between gas molecules within a MOF.  These cooperative gas-gas interactions lead to highly organized behavior, which results in the formation of gas aggregates about 40 nanometers in size,  Yaghi says.  The aggregates are arranged in orderly superlattice structures, which is in stark contrast to the prevailing view that the adsorption of gas molecules by MOFs occurs stochastically.  Yaghi and Terasaki are the corresponding authors of a paper describing this study that has been published in Nature. The paper is titled  Extra adsorption and adsorbate superlattice formation in metal-organic frameworks.  The lead authors are Hae Sung Cho, Hexiang Deng and Keiichi Miyasaka. Other co-authors are Zhiyue Dong, Minhyung Cho, Alexander Neimark and Jeung Ku Kang. Since Yaghi s original invention, thousands of different types of MOFs have been created. A typical MOF consists of a metal oxide center surrounded by organic molecules that form a highly porous three-dimensional crystal framework. The variations on this basic structure are virtually limitless and can be customized so that a MOF s pores adsorb specific gas molecules, making MOFs potentially ideal gas storage vessels.  One gram of MOF has a surface area of up to 10,000 square meters onto which it is possible to compact gas molecules into MOF pores like so many bees on a honeycomb without the high pressures and low temperatures usually required for compressed gas storage,  Yaghi says. The selectivity and uptake capacity of a MOF are determined by the nature of the gas molecule being adsorbed and its interactions with the MOF s constituents. While the interactions of gas molecules with the internal surface of a MOF and among themselves within individual pores have been extensively studied, the gas-gas interactions across a MOF s pore walls have not been explored until now. With their SAXS-based gas adsorption crystallography technique, Yaghi, Terasaki and their collaborators discovered that local strain in the MOF induced by pore-filling can give rise to collective and long-range gas-gas interactions, resulting in the formation of superlattices that extend over several pores.  We were able to track and map the distribution and ordering of adsorbate molecules in five members of the mesoporous MOF-74 series along entire adsorption desorption isotherms,  Yaghi says.  In all cases, we found that the capillary condensation that fills the pores gives rise to the formation of extra-adsorption domains that span several neighboring pores and have a higher adsorbate density than non-domain pores.  The next step, Yaghi says, will be to apply this new gas adsorption crystallography technique to other porous molecular systems that can serve as gas storage vessels, such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs).  We want to generate a comprehensive view of how various gases interact collectively within porous materials interior,  says Yaghi.  We will then feed this data into computer models to improve the theory of gas adsorption.  A link to the original story is provided below.","Published: November 18, 2015"

The study, led by the University of Cambridge in collaboration with Durham University, Macquarie University, and Trinity College Dublin, found that reductions in the length of the paracingulate sulcus (PCS), a fold towards the front of the brain, were associated with increased risk of hallucinations in people diagnosed with schizophrenia. The PCS is one of the last structural folds to develop in the brain before birth, and varies in size between individuals. In a previous study, a team of researchers led by Dr Jon Simons from the Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge, found that variation in the length of the PCS in healthy individuals was linked to the ability to distinguish real from imagined information, a process known as  reality monitoring . In this new study, published in the journal Nature Communications, Dr. Simons and his colleagues analyzed 153 structural MRI scans of people diagnosed with schizophrenia and matched control participants, measuring the length of the PCS in each participant s brain. As difficulty distinguishing self-generated information from that perceived in the outside world may be responsible for many kinds of hallucinations, the researchers wanted to assess whether there was a link between length of the PCS and propensity to hallucinate. The researchers found that in people diagnosed with schizophrenia, a 1 cm reduction in the fold s length increased the likelihood of hallucinations by nearly 20%. The effect was observed regardless of whether hallucinations were auditory or visual in nature, consistent with a reality monitoring explanation.  Schizophrenia is a complex spectrum of conditions that is associated with many differences throughout the brain, so it can be difficult to make specific links between brain areas and the symptoms that are often observed,  says Dr Simons.  By comparing brain structure in a large number of people diagnosed with schizophrenia with and without the experience of hallucinations, we have been able to identify a particular brain region that seems to be associated with a key symptom of the disorder.  The researchers believe that changes in other areas of the brain are likely also important in generating the complex phenomena of hallucinations, possibly including regions that process visual and auditory perceptual information. In people who experience hallucinations, these areas may produce altered perceptions which, due to differences in reality monitoring processes supported by regions around the PCS, may be misattributed as being real. For example, a person may vividly imagine a voice but judge that it arises from the outside world, experiencing the voice as a hallucination.  We think that the PCS is involved in brain networks that help us recognize information that has been generated ourselves,  adds Dr Jane Garrison, first author of the study,  People with a shorter PCS seem less able to distinguish the origin of such information, and appear more likely to experience it as having been generated externally.  Hallucinations are very complex phenomena that are a hallmark of mental illness and, in different forms, are also quite common across the general population. There is likely to be more than one explanation for why they arise, but this finding seems to help explain why some people experience things that are not actually real.

The findings are described in the current online issue of the journal Alzheimer s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer s Association. The results underscore the complexity and diversity of AD, whose causes appear to be a mix of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors. Previous research has shown a link between the brain s stress signaling pathways and AD. Specifically, the release of a stress-coping hormone called corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), which is widely found in the brain and acts as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator, is dysregulated in AD and is associated with impaired cognition and with detrimental changes in tau protein and increased production of amyloid-beta protein fragments that clump together and trigger the neurodegeneration characteristic of AD.  Our work and that of our colleagues on stress and CRF have been mechanistically implicated in Alzheimer s disease, but agents that impact CRF signaling have not been carefully tested for therapeutic efficacy or long-term safety in animal models,  said the study s principal investigator and corresponding author Robert Rissman, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Neurosciences and Biomarker Core Director for the Alzheimer s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS).  The novelty of this study is two-fold: We used a preclinical prevention paradigm of a CRF-antagonist (a drug that blocks the CRF receptor in brain cells) called R121919 in a well-established AD model   and we did so in a way that draws upon our experience in human trials. We found that R121919 antagonism of CRF-receptor-1 prevented onset of cognitive impairment and synaptic/dendritic loss in AD mice.  In other words, the researchers determined that modulating the mouse brain s stress circuitry (without actually changing the normal response) mitigated generation and accumulation of amyloid plaques widely attributed with causing neuronal damage and death. As a consequence, behavioral indicators of AD were prevented and cellular damage was reduced.  The mice began treatment at 30-days-old   before any pathological or cognitive signs of AD were present   and continued until six months of age. One particular challenge, Rissman noted, is limiting exposure of the drug to the brain so that it does not impact the body s ability to response to stress.  This can be accomplished because one advantage of these types of small molecule drugs is that they readily cross the blood-brain barrier and actually prefer to act in the brain,  Rissman said. Drugs like R121919 were originally designed to treat generalized anxiety disorder, irritable bowel syndrome and other diseases, but failed to be effective in treating those disorders.  Rissman s prior work demonstrated that CRF and its receptors are integrally involved in changes in another AD hallmark, tau phosphorylation,  said William Mobley, MD, PhD, chair of the Department of Neurosciences and interim co-director of the Alzheimer s Disease Cooperative Study at UC San Diego.  This new study extends those original mechanistic findings to the amyloid pathway and preservation of cellular and synaptic connections.  Work like this is an excellent example of UC San Diego s bench-to-bedside legacy, whereby we can quickly move our basic science findings into the clinic for testing,  said Mobley. Rissman said R121919 was well-tolerated by AD mice (no significant adverse effects) and deemed safe, suggesting CRF-antagonism is a viable, disease-modifying therapy for AD.  Rissman noted that repurposing R121919 for human use was likely not possible at this point. He and colleagues are collaborating with the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute to design new assays to discover the next generation of CRF receptor-1 antagonists for testing in early phase human safety trials.  More work remains to be done, but this is the kind of basic research that is fundamental to ultimately finding a way to cure   or even prevent   Alzheimer s disease,  said David Brenner, MD, vice chancellor, UC San Diego Health Sciences and dean of UC San Diego School of Medicine.  These findings by Dr. Rissman and his colleagues at UC San Diego and at collaborating institutions on the Mesa suggest we are on the cusp of creating truly effective therapies.

A team led by Dr. Hern n L pez-Schier, head of the Research Unit Sensory Biology and Organogenesis at Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen, has now succeeded in promoting the repair of an injured neural circuit in zebrafish. Key for the researchers  success was the messenger molecule cAMP, which is produced by an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase. For their experiment, the scientist used a special form of this enzyme which is inducible by blue light. Using optogenetics, the scientists are able to specifically modulate the production of cAMP in cells expressing this enzyme by the use of blue light. The researchers used this system in zebrafish larvae which had interrupted sensory lateralis nerves. These nerves normally communicate external sensory signals to the brain, but cannot normally repair after injury.  However, when blue light was shone on severed nerves that expressed a photoactivatable adenylyl cyclase, their repair was dramatically increased,  remembers PhD student Yan Xiao who is the first author of the study.  While untreated nerve terminals only made synapses again in five percent of the cases, about 30% did after photostimulation.  In simple terms: the scientists were able to stimulate the repair of a neuronal circuit by elevating cAMP with blue light.  Optogenetics have revolutionized neurobiology, since the method has already been used to modify for instance the electrical activity of neurons. However, our results show for the first time how the repair of a complex neural circuit in a whole animal can be promoted remotely by the use of light , explains L pez-Schier. But the head of the study thinks that this is only the beginning:  Our results are a first step. Now we would like to investigate, whether these results can be extrapolated beyond single neurons in zebrafish, to more complex neuronal circuits of higher animals.  The scientist could think of using this method for future therapeutic approaches for the treatment of neuropathies like those occurring in the wake of Diabetes and other diseases.

Researchers at the George Washington (GW) University may have unearthed another piece of the puzzle. In a recent study, scientists discovered that human brains exhibit more plasticity, propensity to be modeled by the environment, than chimpanzee brains and that this may have accounted for part of human evolution. This study, the first of its kind to examine the heritability of brain organization in chimpanzees compared to humans, provides a clue as to why humans are so capable of adapting to various environments and cultures. Three-dimensional models of chimpanzee and human skulls showing their endocranial casts (teal) and brains (purple). Image credit: Jose Manual de la Cuetara, Aida Gomez-Robles  The research team studied 218 human brains and 206 chimpanzee brains to compare two things: brain size and organization as related to genetic similarity. The human brains were from twins (identical and fraternal) or siblings; the chimpanzee brains had a variety of kinship relationships, including mothers and offspring or half siblings. The study found that human and chimpanzee brain size were both greatly influenced by genetics. In contrast, the findings related to brain organization were different for chimpanzees and humans. In chimpanzees, brain organization is also highly heritable, but in humans this is not the case. ""We found that the anatomy of the chimpanzee brain is more strongly controlled by genes than that of human brains, suggesting that the human brain is extensively shaped by its environment no matter its genetics,"" said Aida G mez-Robles, postdoctoral scientist at the GW Center for the Advanced Study of Human Paleobiology and lead author on the paper.

Research published this month in Nature Neuroscience identified a surprisingly small set of molecular patterns that dominate gene expression in the human brain and appear to be common to all individuals, providing key insights into the core of the genetic code that makes our brains distinctly human.  So much research focuses on the variations between individuals, but we turned that question on its head to ask, what makes us similar?  says Ed Lein, PhD, Investigator at the Allen Institute for Brain Science.  What is the conserved element among all of us that must give rise to our unique cognitive abilities and human traits?  Researchers used data from the publicly available Allen Human Brain Atlas to investigate how gene expression varies across hundreds of functionally distinct brain regions in six human brains. They began by ranking genes by the consistency of their expression patterns across individuals, and then analyzed the relationship of these genes to one another and to brain function and association with disease.  Looking at the data from this unique vantage point enables us to study gene patterning that we all share,  says Mike Hawrylycz, Ph.D., Investigator at the Allen Institute for Brain Science.  We used the Allen Human Brain Atlas data to quantify how consistent the patterns of expression for various genes are across human brains, and to determine the importance of the most consistent and reproducible genes for brain function.  Despite the anatomical complexity of the brain and the complexity of the human genome, most of the patterns of gene usage across all 20,000 genes could be characterized by just 32 expression patterns.  While many of these patterns were similar in human and mouse, the dominant genetic model organism for biomedical research, many genes showed different patterns in human.  Surprisingly, genes associated with neurons were most conserved across species, while those for the supporting glial cells showed larger differences. The most highly stable genes the genes that were most consistent across all brains include those that are associated with diseases and disorders like autism and Alzheimer s and include many existing drug targets. These patterns provide insights into what makes the human brain distinct and raise new opportunities to target therapeutics for treating disease. The researchers also found that the pattern of gene expression in cerebral cortex is correlated with  functional connectivity  as revealed by neuroimaging data from the Human Connectome Project.   It is exciting to find a correlation between brain circuitry and gene expression by combining high quality data from these two large-scale projects,  says David Van Essen, PhD, professor at Washington University in St. Louis and a leader of the Human Connectome Project.  The human brain is phenomenally complex, so it is quite surprising that a small number of patterns can explain most of the gene variability across the brain,  says Christof Koch, PhD, President and Chief Scientific Officer at the Allen Institute for Brain Science.  There could easily have been thousands of patterns, or none at all. This gives us an exciting way to look further at the functional activity that underlies the uniquely human brain.

They also reported the first real-world demonstration of what happens in the brain as people observe artwork.  You can do testing in the lab, but it s very artificial,  said Jose Luis Contreras-Vidal, Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen Distinguished Professor of electrical and computer engineering at UH.  We were looking at how to measure brain activity in action and in context.  The researchers reported their findings in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. In addition to Contreras-Vidal, the research team included Kimberly Kontson and Eugene Civillico, scientists with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); artist Dario Robleto; Menil curator Michelle White, and Murad Megjhani, Justin Brantley, Jesus Cruz-Garza and Sho Nakagome, all of whom work in the UH Laboratory for Non-Invasive Brain Machine Interfaces. The research found significant increases in functional, or task-related, connectivity in localized brain networks when the subjects viewed art they considered aesthetically pleasing, compared with baseline readings. They found differences both between men and women and between the youngest and oldest subjects.  The direction of signal flow showed early recruitment of broad posterior [visual] areas followed by focal anterior activation,  they wrote.  Significant differences in the strength of connections were also observed across age and gender. This work provides evidence that EEG [electroencephalogram], deployed on freely behaving subjects, can detect selective signal flow in neural networks, identify significant differences between subject groups, and report with greater-than-chance accuracy the complexity of a subject s visual percept of aesthetically pleasing art.  Kontson, a biomedical research fellow at the FDA who led the research during a post-doctoral fellowship, said researchers started with three questions: Can useable brain data be collected in an uncontrolled setting? How well do different models of EEG headsets perform? Is it possible to collect substantial amounts of data relatively quickly?  EEG headsets are considered medical devices if intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions. Kontson said the FDA is interested in the potential use of large and complex data sets    big data    for regulatory decision-making. Data was collected from 431 people as they viewed Robleto s solo show at the Menil Collection in Houston,  The Boundary of Life Is Quietly Crossed,  a sculptural installation that included both visual and aural representations of the heart. Researchers categorized each piece as either complex or moderate; they also asked each participant to face a blank wall for one minute before entering the exhibit in order to obtain baseline data. The Frontiers in Human Neuroscience paper is based on data from 20 people who wore a reference gel-based EEG headset; Contreras-Vidal said findings from those who wore one of four models of dry-electrode headsets   easier to use in public, as they require little preparation or instruction will be reported later, as will an analysis on data collected with the dry headsets. The initial results allowed researchers to predict from the brain activity with 55 percent accuracy whether the participant was looking at a complex piece of art, one categorized as moderately complex or a blank wall. That compares to 33 percent accuracy for random prediction. The knowledge could have varying applications. Much of Contreras-Vidal s recent work centers on using brain activity to help people with disabilities use bionic hands or to regain movement by  walking  in exoskeletons powered by their own thoughts. He sees this research with artists and museum-goers a related project collects brain activity from dancers, visual artists, musicians and writers as potentially leading to technologies that can restore sensory processing in people with neurological impairments. Artists and museum curators could use the findings to learn more about how museum displays affect the way people move through and react to an exhibit, which works are preferred by museum-goers and other information, Contreras-Vidal. But he doesn t expect the research to produce a how-to on creating art.  I don t think we will understand the mystery (of how art is created),  he said.  The conception of art is a very individual process, built on the artist s experiences, skills, memories, values and drives. But we will know what happens in the brain. We might find that there are people who are very attuned to visual art, or to music, or poetry, and there might be an underlying common neural network. If we know that, we could optimize the delivery of art for therapy, for teaching.  University of Houston   Original reporting by: Jeannie KeverKonston K et al.

Recent and rapid advances in the field encouraged me to participate in the 13th Annual International Cord Blood Symposium (ICBS) roundtable discussion earlier this year, organized by Cord Blood Registry , the world s largest private newborn stem cell bank. There, I had the fortuitous opportunity to interact with some of the top global leaders in the cord blood and regenerative medicine space. These experiences not only enlightened me as to the existing body of knowledge regarding the therapeutic potential of newborn stem cells, but also got me thinking about why we as scientists should consider an Umbilical Cord Blood (UCB) bank as a potential untapped source of samples for our research and clinical trials. Following the first successful stem cell transplant in 1988, which was performed on a child suffering from Fanconi s anemia [1], UCB transplantation gained popularity amongst clinicians and scientists. Since then, UCB banking has continued growing as an industry, to fulfill medical needs and to keep up with consumer demand. These dedicated facilities play a pivotal role in safely securing high quality UCB units, many of which are already being collected in accordance with federal regulatory standards. Their main aim is to provide a better product when required for clinical utility. Just over a decade ago there were only 23 active cord blood banks in existence; now there are 485 cord blood banks worldwide. [2] So far, according to a recent publication in Cytotherapy this year, more than 35,000 UCB transplantations have been performed in the treatment of certain malignant and non-malignant diseases worldwide [3]. To date, the vast majority of transplantations that have been performed involved unrelated allogeneic donor cord blood. However, autologous stem cell transplants--where the transplanted cells are from the patient s own cord blood--show great potential for regenerative medicine. Autologous stem cell transplantation eliminates the need for donor matching and therefore poses no risk of patient rejection.  The cord blood industry is an expanding field and is gaining in popularity. Related biomedical fields, such as gene editing, were initially over-hyped as the breakthrough technology of the future, yet slow to be adopted by the somewhat skeptical scientific and medical community. After an initial bumpy start, these emerging fields are truly starting to deliver and be adopted by the mainstream.  The field of gene editing, and its use of CRISPR technology, is a great example. Back when CRISPR was first discovered, there was a great deal of concern and reservation about adopting this groundbreaking methodology. However, in recent years CRISPR technology has become widely accepted by biologists as a search-and-replace tool to alter DNA, correcting down to a single base in the code. It is now considered a promising new approach for gene editing without affecting germ cells in people with devastating illnesses [4,5]. Similarly, based on the tremendous therapeutic potential and initial pre-clinical success of cord blood stem cells, scientists are optimistic that UCB stem cells will be able to deliver new treatment modalities for many medical conditions in the next few years. Currently, several FDA-regulated clinical trials using stem cells derived from UCB are underway in an attempt to find a treatment for such diseases as autism, pediatric stroke and cerebral palsy, etc.  Promising preliminary results have paved the way for these trials to move into Phase II studies. For example researchers at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, in collaboration with Cord Blood Registry, are commencing phase 2 of an innovative FDA-regulated clinical trial to investigate stem cell therapy in children diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The study aims to compare the safety and efficacy of an intravenous infusion of either banked cord blood or freshly harvested bone marrow [6]. Dr. Charles S. Cox, Jr., the principal investigator of the study, and one of the panelists at the recent ICBS Roundtable Discussion notes that in regard to this trial ""there is preclinical data indicating that the ongoing neuroinflammatory response is a driver of further injury in CP, so the hope is to reduce this neuroinflammation."" ""Our goal is to break the cycle of inflammation and injury"" adds Cox. [7] Stem cell research is continuously evolving and umbilical cord blood banking will likely become more effective as cell-based technologies advance in the near future. However there are some technical challenges that the industry faces, and scientists are working hard to resolve them. One of the critical factors that can significantly influence and delay UCB engraftment is the limited number of stem cells present in a single UCB collection. Utilization of cord blood units that fail to meet cell dose guidelines established for transplant medicine can lead to graft failure and delayed engraftment kinetics in recipients. Therefore, it is an absolute priority and a real challenge to develop an efficient protocol for UCB cell expansion. In the last two decades, multiple strategies have been evolved such as optimization of cytokine cocktails, co-culture systems, small molecules, and expression of specific self-renewal related genes to improve the outcome of hematopoietic stem cell and HSC-progenitor cell expansion protocols. The ultimate focus is to increase the cell dose of a UCB graft. Another technology, the ability to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), has changed the direction of stem cell research around the world and may represent a potential cell source for future personalized medicine. Cord blood banks provide an ideal source of cells for such an endeavor because they contain large numbers of well-documented cell populations. In addition, UCB cells are derived from a juvenescent source and are less likely to contain potentially deleterious mutations than cells derived from adult tissues.  Early lab studies have demonstrated that UCB stem cells could be considered a promising source from which to generate iPSCs. Such UCB-derived stem cells could then be used to treat a wide variety of diseases including metabolic disease, genetic disease, congenital malformation and also, in wider application, many of the various injuries suffered with the onset of degenerative disease [8].  Therapeutic potential and initial clinical successes of UCB stem cell-based therapies has encouraged clinicians to launch a number of clinical trials in the past decade. Today, cord blood has been used in the treatment of more than 80 diseases and in the future, that number may grow. Laboratory/preclinical research results have shown that cord blood stem cells may also serve as a viable medical tool to help repair injured tissues or organs. It is clearly an emerging field that stands at the juncture of a variety of rapidly developing scientific disciplines and I am very excited and intrigued to be a part of this and see how this field unfolds.

The Epic Sciences no cell left behind  CTC detection and characterization platform is used to quantify the proteomic and genomic changes that accumulate in tumor cells over time and in response to successive rounds of therapy. Following a simple blood draw, the Epic Sciences platform can detect all categories of CTCs in the blood and identify, on a single cell basis, subpopulations of metastatic cancer cells that may be resistant or susceptible to cancer therapeutics. Currently, other technologies exclude many CTCs that do not adhere to assumptions about size or surface markers, which precludes a comprehensive view of the heterogeneity among a patient's tumor cells that may affect therapeutic response. The Epic Sciences platform has an unbiased detection approach in which all nucleated cells are analyzed. The research teams at the Abramson Cancer Center, a leader in the liquid biopsy field for cancer detection, will use Epic Sciences' CTC detection and analysis platform to explore the heterogeneity of a diversity of cancer types, with a focus on genomic and phenotypic markers that help to better understand the utility of existing therapies and potential new drugs. ""Cancer is a complex, heterogeneous disease in which both genotype and phenotype change throughout progression,"" said Erica Carpenter, MBA, Ph.D., Director of the Circulating Tumor Material Laboratory and Research Assistant Professor in the Division of Hematology/Oncology at Penn. ""We therefore need to utilize the most innovative technologies that allow us to study disease resistance."" Epic Sciences recently announced its platform's capability to subject a single CTC to both proteomic and genomic analyses, including deep sequencing of known cancer genes.

Rolig, a postdoctoral researcher in the UO's Institute of Molecular Biology. In the project, researchers watched for immune response as isolates of species of bacteria, normally associated with healthy zebrafish, were introduced one at a time and in combination into previously germ-free intestines of the fish. In a telling sequence, one bacterial species, Vibrio, drew numerous neutrophils, which indicated a rapid inflammatory response in one fish. Another species, Shewanella, inserted into a separate germ-free fish barely attracted an immune response. In a third germ-free fish, both species were introduced together and assembled with a ratio of 90- percent Vibrio to 10-percent Shewanella.The inflammatory response in the third fish was completely controlled by the low-abundance species. ""Until now, we've only been able to capture proportional information, like you d see displayed in a pie graph, of the makeup of various microbiota, in percentages of their abundance,"" Rolig said. ""Biologists in this field have typically assumed an equal contribution based on that makeup.  Low counts of a bacterial species generally have been discounted in importance, but slight shifts in the ratios of abundant microbe populations have been thought to have roles in obesity, diabetes and inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn s disease. That thinking is now changing, Rolig said.  The contribution of each bacterium is not equal. There is a per-capita effect that needs to be considered. The keystone   an important participant that functions to regulate a healthy microbiota   may reside in low-abundant bacterial species. The research team found through additional scrutiny that these species secreted molecules, for now unidentified, that allowed them to dampen the immune response to the whole community. ""Now we've shown that these minor members can have a major impact. If we can identify these keystone species, and find that in a disease state one species may be missing, we might be able to go in with a specific probiotic to restore healthy functioning,"" said Rolig, who also is a scientist in the National Institutes of Health-funded Microbial Ecology and Theory of Animals Center for Systems Biology, known as the META Center, at the UO. To develop a model to capture per-capita contributions of microbes in a population, Rolig and her co-authors   biology graduate student Adam R. Burns, microbiologist Brendan Bohannan of the Institute of Ecology and Evolution and biologist Karen Guillemin, director of the META Center   turned to UO physicist Raghuveer Parthasarathy. His math-driven model, detailed in the paper, provides formulas that predict collective inflammatory responses of combinations of bacteria.  I m really proud of this paper because it exemplifies an achievement of one of the major goals of the META Center for Systems Biology, namely to provide a predictive model of how host-microbe systems function,  Guillemin said.  This experimental and modeling framework could be readily generalized to more complex systems such as humans, for example to predict disease severity in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease based on the pro-inflammatory capacity of their gut microbes as assayed in cell culture.

Most of us can, thanks to a sense called proprioception, which tells us where our body parts are relative to each other and our environment. Not surprisingly, this sense is essential for normal movement and balance walking, for instance. For decades, biologists have been trying to find the crucial sensor protein in nerve endings that translates muscle and tendon stretching into proprioceptive nerve signals. Now in a study led by scientists from The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) has identified this sensor protein in mice. It turns out to be a protein called Piezo2, which was found recently to mediate the sense of touch.  To the layman it might not seem surprising that touch and proprioception would use the same sensor protein, but within this field there has been a lot of evidence suggesting otherwise so finding that Piezo2 does both was a surprise,  said lead investigator Ardem Patapoutian, a professor at TSRI and investigator with Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The laboratories of Thomas M. Jessell at Columbia University and Katherine A. Wilkinson at San Jose State University collaborated on the study. Multi-Purpose Protein Patapoutian and his laboratory specialize in identifying and characterizing sensory transducer proteins and over the past 15 years have identified transducers of cold, heat and pain. In two studies published last year, they identified Piezo2 as the principal sensor for ordinary, non-painful touch in mice. The new findings stem in part from those studies, in which Patapoutian and his team developed transgenic mice that can be made to switch off Piezo2 activity in  touch  neurons and other sensory neurons based in the spine. With Piezo2 silenced, the mice showed profound deficits in responding to touch. But they also showed a different kind of deficit.  Their walking was a bit abnormal, which gave us a hint that some proprioceptive neurons might be affected, too,  said Seung-Hyun Woo, a research associate in the Patapoutian laboratory who was first author of the new study. In an initial set of experiments for the new study, the team managed to isolate mouse sensory neurons involved in proprioception and tested these neurons  electrical responses to mild mechanical pressure. Such neurons  nerve ends and cell bodies are known to be studded with mechanically activated ion channel proteins, which essentially spring open admitting a surge of charged molecules (ions) and triggering an electrical nerve impulse when the surrounding nerve or cell membrane is distorted sufficiently by a stretching of the local muscle tissue. Prior studies had suggested that the main stretch-sensing protein expressed by proprioceptive neurons is one that specializes in admitting sodium ions. However, the team found evidence from these initial tests that the main ion-channel protein on proprioceptive neurons is not a selective sodium-channel protein, but in fact has properties consistent with Piezo2s. The researchers then confirmed that Piezo2 is expressed in mouse proprioceptive neurons and their muscle-embedded nerve ends. To establish Piezo2 s role with more certainty, they developed two lines of transgenic mice in which Piezo2 production could be switched off in proprioceptive neurons shortly after the mice were born. The resulting animals showed severe abnormalities in walking and limb positioning.  Their limbs were everywhere they looked like they were trying to do yoga,  said Woo. In a final set of experiments, the team found that leg muscle tissue from these mice lacking Piezo2 tissue with proprioceptive nerves embedded produced almost no nerve signals in response to muscle stretching, whereas muscle tissue from normal mice produced robust signals.  The data that we have now in support of Piezo2 s role in proprioception are really overwhelming,  said Patapoutian. While the finding is a milestone in sensory neuroscience, it may also lead to a better understanding of some human diseases relating to proprioception. For example, a genetic disorder known as distal arthrogryposis type 5, whose sufferers are born with severely contracted joints, was found in 2013 by Patapoutian and colleagues to be caused by a mutation to the human version of Piezo2. The Patapoutian lab is continuing to investigate.","Published: November 16, 2015"

Being able to detect cancer at an early stage is vital. We have studied how a whole new blood-based method of biopsy can be used to detect cancer, which in the future renders an invasive cell tissue sample unnecessary in diagnosing lung cancer, for instance. In the study, nearly all forms of cancer were identified, which proves that blood-based biopsies have an immense potential to improve early detection of cancer,  according to Jonas Nilsson, cancer researcher at Ume  University and co-author of the article. In the study, researchers from Ume  University, in collaborations with researchers from the Netherlands and the US, have investigated how a new method of blood-based RNA tests of the part of the blood called platelets could be used in detecting and classifying cancer. The results show that blood platelets could constitute a complete and easily accessible blood-based source for sampling and hence be used in diagnosing cancer as well as in the choice of treatment method. Blood samples from 283 individuals were studied of which 228 people had some form of cancer and 55 showed no evidence of cancer. By comparing the blood samples RNA profiles, researchers could identify the presence of cancer with an accuracy of 96 per cent among patients. Among the 39 patients in the study in which an early detection of cancer had been made, 100 per cent of the cases could be identified and classified. In follow-up tests using the same method, researchers could identify the origin of tumours with a so far unsurpassed accuracy of 71 per cent in patients with diagnosed cancer in the lung, breast, pancreas, brain, liver, colon and rectum. The samples could also be sorted in subdivisions depending on molecular differences in the cancer form, which can be of great use in the choice of treatment method.","Published: November 16, 2015"

Colorectal cancer is the number one cancer in Singapore and the foremost cancer amongst males as stated by Singapore s Health Promotion Board. It is also the third most common cancer in the world, with about 1.4 million new cases annually, estimated by the World Cancer Research Fund International. Traditional cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiotherapy do not work well in the colon due to reduced blood flow and the lack of oxygen and nutrient flow in the tumour environment. This is because such therapies rely on oxygen molecules to damage the DNA of cancer cells and blood flow to transport therapeutic drugs to the tumour. In contrast, the NTU team showed that dead C. sporogenes bacteria can kill tumour cells in an oxygen-starved tumour microenvironment. Prof Teoh, who is Chair of NTU s School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering said this discovery opens new doors for the treatment of colon cancer as bacteria therapy is recently gaining interest as an alternative to traditional treatments.  We found that even when the C. sporogenes bacteria is dead, its natural toxicity continues to kill cancer cells, unlike the conventional chemotherapy drugs which need oxygen to work,  explained Prof Teoh.  While other research groups have experimented with bacteria therapy to destroy cancer cells, the biggest problem is that live bacteria will grow and proliferate, posing a high risk of infection and increased toxicity to patients.  In the NTU study, as the bacteria were already killed by heat, there was no risk of the bacteria multiplying and causing more harm than the desired dose meant to kill colorectal cancer cells.  The NTU team conducted experiments in 3D cell culture which were artificially-created environments, resembling the inside of a human body, unlike most lab experiments which are done on a flat surface in a petri-dish. In a 72-hour experiment, the inactive bacteria were able to reduce the growth of colon tumour cells by 74 per cent. In addition, the team tested the secretions harvested from a live bacteria culture and these secretions reduced growth of colon tumour cells by as much as 83 per cent. Professor James Best, Dean of NTU s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, said:  This is a significant discovery that potentially opens a new avenue to tackle this very common cancer, which is difficult to treat after it has spread. While it is early days, this exciting research finding provides hope of a new treatment option for millions of people affected by bowel cancer each year.  Moving forward, the NTU team is looking to study the specific components of the bacteria which help to kill tumour cells and to develop them into usable therapy such as cancer drugs.","Published: November 16, 2015"

Instead of forming bone, you could form fat. Researchers at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine may have found a way to tip the scale in favor of bone formation. They used cytochalasin D, a naturally occurring substance found in mold, as a proxy to alter gene expression in the nuclei of mesenchymal stem cells to force them to become osteoblasts (bone cells). By treating stem cells   which can become fat or bone cells - with cytochalasin D  the result was clear: the stem cells became bone cells. Further, injecting a small amount of cytochalasin D into the bone marrow space of mice caused bone to form. This research details how the scientists altered the stem cells and triggered bone growth.  And the bone forms quickly,  said Janet Rubin, MD, senior author of the paper and professor of medicine at the UNC School of Medicine.  The data and images are so clear; you don t have to be a bone biologist to see what cytochalasin D does in one week in a mouse. Rubin added,  This was not what we expected. This was not what we were trying to do in the lab. But what we ve found could become an amazing way to jump-start local bone formation. However, this will not address osteoporosis, which involves bone loss throughout the skeleton.  At the center of the discovery is a protein called actin, which forms fibers that span the cytoplasm of cells to create the cell s cytoskeleton. Osteoblasts have more cytoskeleton than do adipocytes (fat cells).  Buer Sen, MD, first author of the Stem Cells paper and research associate in Rubin s lab, used cytochalasin D to break up the actin cytoskeleton. In theory   and according to the literature   this should have destroyed the cell s ability to become bone cells. The cells, in turn, should have been more likely to turn into adipocytes. Instead, Sen found that actin was trafficked into the nuclei of the stem cells, where it had the surprising effect of inducing the cells to become osteoblasts.  My first reaction was,  No way, Buer,  Rubin said.  This must be wrong. It goes against everything in the literature.  But he said,  I ve rerun the experiments. This is what happens.  Rubin s team expanded the experiments while exploring the role of actin. They found that when actin enters and stays in the nucleus, it enhances gene expression in a way that causes the cell to become an osteoblast.  Amazingly, we found that the actin forms an architecture inside the nucleus and turns on the bone-making genetic program,  Rubin said.  If we destroy the cytoskeleton but do not allow the actin to enter the nucleus, the little bits of actin just sit in the cytoplasm, and the stem cells do not become bone cells.  Rubin s team then turned to a mouse model. Using live mice, they showed that cytochalasin D induced bone formation in mice. Bone formation in mice isn t very different from that in humans, so this research might be translatable. And while cytochalasin D might not be the actual agent scientists use to trigger bone formation in the clinic, Rubin s study shows that triggering actin transport into the nuclei of cells may be a good way to force mesenchymal stem cells to become bone cells.

Until now, though, he did not have a way to trace lycopene s metabolism in the human body.  Our team has learned to grow tomato plants in suspension culture that produce lycopene molecules with a heavier molecular weight. With this tool, we can trace lycopene s absorption, biodistribution, and metabolism in the body of healthy adults. In the future, we will be able to conduct such studies in men who have prostate cancer and gain important information about this plant component s anti-cancer activity,  said John W. Erdman Jr., a U of I emeritus professor of nutrition. The U of I team began developing the tomato cultures that would yield heavier, traceable carbon molecules about 10 years ago. Erdman, doctoral student Nancy Engelmann, and  plant gurus  Randy Rogers and Mary Ann Lila first learned to optimize the production of lycopene in tomato cell cultures. They then grew the best lycopene producers with non-radioactive carbon-13 sugars, allowing carbon-13 to be incorporated into the lycopene molecules. Because most carbon in nature is carbon-12, the lycopene containing heavier carbon atoms is easy to follow in the body. Soon after the carbon-13 technology was established, Engelmann, now Moran, took a postdoctoral research position at Ohio State University in the lab of medical oncologist Steven K. Clinton, and scientists at Illinois and Ohio State initiated human trials. In this first study, the team followed lycopene activity in the blood of eight persons by feeding them lycopene labeled with the non-radioactive carbon-13. The researchers then drew blood hourly for 10 hours after dosing and followed with additional blood draws 1, 3, and 28 days later.  The results provide novel information about absorption efficiency and how quickly lycopene is lost from the body. We determined its half-life in the body and now understand that the structural changes occur after the lycopene is absorbed,  Erdman explained.  Most tomato lycopene that we eat exists as the all-trans isomer, a rigid and straight form, but in the bodies of regular tomato consumers, most lycopene exists as cis isomers, which tend to be bent and flexible. Because cis-lycopene is the form most often found in the body, some investigators think it may be the form responsible for disease risk reduction,  Moran explained.  We wanted to understand why there is more cis-lycopene in the body, and by mathematically modeling our patients  blood carbon-13 lycopene concentration data, we found that it is likely due to a conversion of all-trans to cis lycopene, which occurs soon after we absorb lycopene from our food,  she added. The plant biofactories that produce the heavier, traceable lycopene are now being used to produce heavier versions of other bioactive food components. In another trial, phytoene, a second carbon-13 labeled tomato bioactive molecule, has been produced and tested in four human subjects.  Our most recent project involves producing a heavy carbon version of lutein, found in green leafy vegetables and egg yolks. Lutein is known to be important for eye and brain health. In this case, we began with carrot suspension cultures and have already produced small quantities of  heavy-labeled  lutein for animal trials,  Rogers said. Right now, though, the Illinois Ohio State team is excited about the new information the lycopene study has yielded.  In the future, these new techniques could help us to better understand how lycopene reduces prostate cancer risk and severity. We will be able to develop evidence-based dietary recommendations for prostate cancer prevention,  Erdman said. This new journal article represents the most thorough study of lycopene metabolism that has been done to date, he added.","Published: November 16, 2015"

A Korean research team jointly led by Professor Chan Beum Park of the Materials Science and Engineering Department at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Dr. Kwon Yu from the Bionano Center at the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB) conducted research to suppress an abnormal assembly of beta-amyloids, a protein commonly found in the brain, by using photo-excited porphyrins. Beta-amyloid plaques are known to cause Alzheimer's disease. This research finding suggests new ways to treat neurodegenerative illnesses including Alzheimer's disease. It was published online as the lead article in the September 21th issue of Angewandte Chemie. Light-induced treatments using organic photosensitizers have advantages to managing the treatment in time and area. In the case of cancer treatments, doctors use photodynamic therapies where a patient is injected with an organic photosensitizer, and a light is shed on the patient's lesion. However, such therapies had never been employed to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer's starts when a protein called beta-amyloid is created and deposited in a patient's brain. The abnormally folded protein created this way harms the brain cells by inducing the degradation of brain functions, for example, dementia. If beta-amyloid creation can be suppressed at an early stage, the formation of amyloid deposits will stop. This could prevent Alzheimer's disease or halt its progress. The research team effectively prevented the buildup of beta-amyloids by using blue LED lights and a porphyrin inducer, which is a biocompatible organic compound. By absorbing light energy, a photosensitizer such as porphyrin reaches the excitation state. Active oxygen is created as the porphyrin returns to its ground state. The active oxygen oxidizes a beta-amyloid monomer, and by combining with it, disturbs its assembly. Deposits of beta-amyloid in fruit flies stopped by using porphyrin and blue LED lights. Credit: KAIST / BI Lee et al., Angewandte Chemie, 2015  The technique was tested on drosophilae which were produced to model Alzheimer on invertebrates. The research showed that symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in the fruit flies such as damage on synapse and muscle, neuronal apoptosis, degradation in motility, and decreased longevity were alleviated. Treatments with light provide additional benefits: less medication is needed than other drug treatments, and there are fewer side effects. When developed, photodynamic therapy will be used widely for this reason. Professor Park said, ""This work has significance as it was the first case to use light and photosensitizers to stop deposits of beta-amyloids. We plan to carry the research further by testing compatibility with other organic and inorganic photosensitizers and by changing the subject of photodynamic therapy to vertebrate such as mice.""

The study looked at connections between areas of the brain that play a role in regulating consciousness. For the study, 27 people in a coma with severe brain injuries were compared to 14 healthy people of the same ages. All of the participants had functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans taken of their brains. For those in a coma, the scans were conducted after any sedative drugs were out of their systems. Three months after their injuries, four of the people with coma had recovered consciousness. The others remained in a minimally conscious state or a vegetative state at three months. All of the comatose people had significant disruption in the connections between brain areas and the posterior cingulate cortex. These changes were the same whether the brain injury was due to trauma or to lack of oxygen, such as from cardiac arrest. The researchers found that the coordination of activity between the posterior cingulate cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex was significantly different between those who went on to recover from the coma and those who remained in a minimally conscious state or a vegetative state. The coordination between the two brain areas was the same for the healthy participants and those who regained consciousness. Study author Stein Silva, MD, PhD, of the French national research institute, INSERM U825, in Toulouse, said that more research is needed before these results can be used to guide decisions about people in comas. ""We need to do more studies with larger numbers of patients to substantiate these results, but the findings are promising,"" Silva said.

The results of their study, published in the journal Movement Disorders, could also have a major impact on the quality of research on Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological condition related to the death of specific brain cells, including cells that control movement, mood, sleep and cognition. The symptoms, which include tremors, slowness of movement, stiffness or rigidity, sleep disorders, loss of the sense of smell, depression, and cognitive dysfunction, can appear in people as young as their thirties, but more commonly appear around the age of 60. It is estimated that the disease touches more than one in 50 people in this age group. Currently, diagnosis of PD can only be established through an analysis of medical history and a neurological examination by a clinician with expertise in movement disorders -- no objective test for the disease exists. As the symptoms of PD often resemble those of other neurological disorders, the rate of misdiagnosis can be as high as 25 per cent, which causes distress in patients. It also creates a challenge for researchers as the data collected in clinical studies can become compromised by misdiagnosis in their pool of subjects. The new criteria gathered knowledge and data from movement disorder experts around the world to create the most comprehensive diagnostic criteria ever developed for the disease, with the aim of improving and broadening diagnosis and treatment of the disease, especially in the early stages. ""In light of the latest scientific insights and technological advances, we were able to establish a new list of criteria based on expert clinical diagnosis,"" says Dr. Ron Postuma, co-Chair of the MDS task force, who is also a researcher in neurosciences at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre and at The Neuro, and associate professor in the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery at McGill University. ""Our aim was to create a benchmark that will systematize the diagnostic process, make it reproducible across centers and that will enable a wider range of non PD-specialized clinicians to provide patients with an accurate diagnosis."" ""These criteria accent how Parkinson's disease is much more than a simple motor disorder, now incorporating motor and non-motor symptoms as well as the genetic component in some forms of PD,"" adds Dr. Daniela Berg, Chair of the MDS task force and Associate Professor at the University of T bingen, Germany. The research team is proposing a new stage classification of the disorder with the aim of focusing attention on the early stages of PD. ""With this new classification our goal is to set up a research agenda that will help identify the features that signal the presence of the disease early on,"" explains Dr. Postuma. ""Our hope is that, as research advances, our understanding of the mechanisms at play in the disorder will enable us to develop therapies and treatments that can be administered early in this process, eventually slowing or stopping the progression of PD altogether.""

Homing in on the therapeutic mechanisms of commonly used antidepressants With the advent of new technology, comes a better understanding of the brain and the hope for novel treatments and medications with improved specificity and therapeutic efficacy. The most widely used class of antidepressants is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which block the reuptake of serotonin from the presynaptic terminal, allowing for accumulation of serotonin within the synaptic cleft. Chronic treatment with SSRIs also induces neurogenesis of mature granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus which are thought to contribute to the antidepressant response. Mature granule cells express high levels of the serotonin receptor, 5HT1A. These receptors are intimately involved in anxiety, depression, and response to antidepressants.   Team finds long-sought protein sensor for the  sixth sense proprioception Can you touch a finger to the tip of your nose with your eyes closed? Most of us can, thanks to a sense called proprioception, which tells us where our body parts are relative to each other and our environment. Not surprisingly, this sense is essential for normal movement and balance walking, for instance. For decades, biologists have been trying to find the crucial sensor protein in nerve endings that translates muscle and tendon stretching into proprioceptive nerve signals. Now in a study published in Nature Neuroscience, a team led by scientists from The Scripps Research Institute has identified this sensor protein in mice.   Thickness of gray matter predicts ability to recognize faces and objects When you see a familiar face, when a bird-watcher catches a glimpse of a rare bird perched on a limb, or when a car-fancier spots a classic auto driving past, the same small region in the brain becomes engaged. For almost two decades, neuroscientists have known that this area, called the fusiform face area (FFA), plays a vital role in the brain's ability to recognize faces and objects that an individual has learned to identify. Now a new study, accepted for publication by the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, has taken this a step further by finding that the thickness of the cortex in the FFA as measured using magnetic resonance imaging can predict a person's ability to recognize faces and objects.   Protein findings open new avenues to understanding and treatment of schizophrenia Stem cells from adult schizophrenia patients form new proteins more slowly than those from healthy people, according to new research. The findings are enhancing understanding of how schizophrenia affects the workings of the brain, and open the way to new approaches for future drug therapies. Involving scientists from Griffith University's Eskitis Institute for Drug Discovery, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and University College Dublin, the research is published in the journal Translational Psychiatry.   Taste perception is influenced by extreme noise conditions Eating is a fundamentally multisensory experience: we don't just eat our food, we also see it, smell it, and hear ourselves chewing it. However, perception of non-food components of the dining experience can also influence flavor perception. For instance, desserts are rated as sweeter if they are presented on a white vs. black plate, and exposure to loud noise reduces affective food ratings.","Published: November 13, 2015"

In 2007 the same researchers published a mutation in the Scyl1 gene in a naturally occurring mouse mutant with similar symptoms. Using next-generation sequencing techniques, they have now succeeded in identifying the first cases of a corresponding condition in humans. This marks the successful end to a search that started in the Neuromuscular Research Department (Center for Anatomy and Cell Biology of MedUni Vienna) more than ten years ago. So-called mdf (""muscle deficient"") mice have an atrophic cerebellum and display symptoms such as muscular atrophy, ataxia (gait disorders) tremor and thinning of the optic nerves. This is due to a mutation in the Scyl1 gene of the mouse, which was discovered more than 10 years ago and first described in 2007 by the group of researchers led by Wolfgang M. Schmidt and Reginald E. Bittner (Neuromuscular Research Department at the Center for Anatomy and Cell Biology of MedUni Vienna). Scyl1, which is highly conserved in evolutionary terms, is an important molecule for intra-cellular transport. For the first time, using modern DNA sequencing techniques (Next Generation Sequencing) it has now become possible to identify mutations in the human SCYL1 gene in patients with similar clinical symptoms. ""Due to the rapid technological advances in the field of Next Generation DNA-Sequencing over the last few years, it is now possible to make a quicker and more comprehensive analysis of the human genome,"" says the corresponding author of the present publication, Reginald E. Bittner. ""Because of the enormous improvement in sequencing output, which produces more than 100 million sequences per individual analyzed, we were able to identify mutations in the SCYL1 gene of three patients for the very first time. The three subjects, two siblings and a girl from a different family, are suffering from symptoms similar to those of the mdf mice. Apart from the neurological manifestations, such as tremor, muscle weakness and ataxia due to cerebellar atrophy, the subjects also repeatedly suffered life-threatening crises with acute liver failure in their early years,"" says Bittner, describing the human SCYL1 disorder. ""Our discovery will help those affected, their families and their treating physicians to understand the molecular genetic cause of this condition. In this case, we only managed to do this because we comprehensively analyzed all the subjects' genes -- even those that had previously not been thought to be linked to a genetic condition,"" explains lead author Wolfgang Schmidt (also from the Neuromuscular Research Department).

The paralysis leaves the face expressionless, which makes it difficult for persons with M bius to express emotions or indicate that they understand a conversation partner's information. This severely inhibits interaction and rapport--creating a challenge not only for the persons with M bius but also for their conversation partners who become insecure and nervous. An international group of researchers centered at Aarhus University's Interacting Minds Centre has completed a study involving five Danish teenagers with M bius Syndrome to see whether it is possible to teach persons who lack facial expressivity to use alternative communication strategies. ""Our research shows that the teenagers significantly improved rapport and interaction with their conversation partners without M bius after just two days' workshop in compensatory communication strategies. And interestingly, it was not only the teenagers with M bius who changed their behavior; the non-M bius interlocutors became much more expressive with both gestures and voices,"" says postdoc John Michael from University of Copenhagen's Center for Subjectivity Research. John Michael is the lead author of the paper Training in compensatory strategies enhances rapport in interactions involving people with M bius syndrome, which is published in the journal Frontiers in Endovascular and Interventional Neurology. M bius Syndrome only occurs in 2 to 20 births per million, so it is an extremely rare condition, which is why the researchers only had five Danish teenagers to test their hypothesis on. But their results can nevertheless say something general about people who find social interaction difficult because of disfigurements or paralysis: ""The workshop we conducted for the five teenagers was adapted from one that the English charity organization Changing Faces conducts for people with severe facial burns or disfigurements. That it proved so effective, not only for the five boys with M bius, but also for their interlocutors, says something important about social interaction,"" says John Michael and adds: ""M bius Syndrome and other conditions that can be socially challenging are often seen as problems which primarily involve the people with the syndrome. But the reactions they get from other people in social situations are equally important, as they can inhibit interaction and rapport. This insight may lead to new forms of therapy and treatment which address other people than just those affected by M bius, i.e. the 'normal healthy individuals' who encounter and interact with people with M bius. And the same may be true with respect to other cases, such as autism for example."" As M bius is a rare and understudied syndrome, and the pool of participants small, the researchers behind the present study hope that their results will be replicated and extended by other researchers. ""As always, more studies are needed. We will seek to replicate the findings with new participants, and observe the long term effects of more prolonged training and of different communicative strategies. But these first findings are highly promising, and it is especially satisfying to see that the basic research we are doing has many practical applications, which can make a real difference in some people's lives,"" John Michael concludes. Five teenagers with M bius interacted with three na ve participants without M bius before they participated in the social skills workshop, where they learned compensatory communication strategies for persons lacking facial expressivity. After the workshop, the five teenagers with M bius interacted with three different na ve participants without M bius. The two interactions were recorded on video and other kinds of recordings were made. These were then assessed by neutral observers. The results documented that the workshop had had a highly positive effect on the interaction and rapport in both groups.

Eventually, the children become blind, bedridden and demented, and typically die within the first decade of their lives. Currently there are no effective treatments. ""Our study opens up the possibility of a one-and-done treatment for this form of Batten disease,"" said Beverly Davidson, PhD, director of the Raymond G. Perelman Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the senior author of the study. Working with scientists at the University of Missouri, Columbia, Davidson's team focused on the late infantile form of the disease that starts in children 2 to 4 years of age and is most often caused by mutations in the gene for the soluble lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), an enzyme which degrades proteins. They showed that if they treated dogs that have a similar disorder by injecting a safe virus containing the TPP1 gene code into the cerebrospinal fluid that fills ventricles, the dogs lived about twice as long as untreated dogs. Symptoms including problems with movement, pupil dilation and making decisions were delayed or, in some cases, did not occur. The treatment, however, did not fully improve the dogs' vision suggesting that delivery to the eye itself may be necessary as well. When the scientists inspected the dogs' brains, they found that the treatment reduced the damage normally caused by the disease. In comparison with untreated dogs, the treated dogs had less reactive glial cells and stored lipofuscins, fatty deposits that are hallmarks of Batten disease and similar disorders, called neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. ""Dr. Davidson and her team undertook a highly innovative approach for Batten disease gene therapy,"" said Jill Morris, Ph.D., program director at NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. ""These results open up a promising path toward developing long-lasting treatments for Batten disease and similar lysosomal storage disorders."" Further inspections of the dogs' brains confirmed the scientists' hypothesis about how the therapy worked. The results suggested that parenchymal cells that line the ventricles and surface of the brain took up the injected genes from the cerebrospinal fluid and made more TPP1 protein. These cells then secreted the protein that, in turn, spread throughout the brain. Initial experiments showed the importance treating the dogs with the immunosuppressant, mycophenolate mofetil, before injecting the TPP1 gene. The immunosuppressant prevented the production of antibodies that accelerated TPP1 clearance from the cerebrospinal fluid. ""We saw profound effects from the gene therapy that, summed up, improved the dogs' health. We certainly hope that this approach will provide children suffering from this disorder similar benefits,"" said Dr. Davidson.

In a study published in the Journal of NeuroOncology, TGen researchers report that PPF works to limit the spread of glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM the most common primary tumor of the brain and central nervous system by targeting a protein called TROY. In addition, TGen laboratory research also found that PPF increases the effectiveness of a standard-of-care chemotherapy drug called temozolomide (TMZ), and radiation, to treat glioblastoma. ""We showed that PPF decreased glioblastoma cell expression of TROY, inhibited glioma cell invasion, and made brain cancer cells more vulnerable to TMZ and radiation,"" said Dr. Nhan Tran, Associate Professor and head of TGen's Central Nervous System Tumor Research Lab. An advantage of small-molecule PPF which has been previously used in clinical trials in an attempt to treat Alzheimer's disease and dementia is that it can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and reach the tumor. And, the FDA has already approved it. ""Our data suggests that PPF, working in combination with TMZ and radiation, could limit glioblastoma invasion and improve the clinical outcome for brain tumor patients,"" said Dr. Tran, the study's senior author. ""GBM is one of the most aggressive of all cancers and it affects people of all ages,"" said Catherine (Bracken) Ivy, founder and president of The Ben & Catherine Ivy Foundation. ""Funding research focused on helping patients survive longer is critical, and studies such as this advance our goal of not only improving treatments for brain cancer, but eventually finding a cure."" One of the primary treatments for glioblastoma is surgical removal of the tumor. However, because of the aggressive way glioblastomas invade surrounding brain tissue, it is impossible to remove all parts of the tumors, and the cancer eventually returns and spreads. This insidious cancer invasion also limits the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy. TGen found that PPF works to limit the spread of glioblastomas by targeting and knocking down the expression of the TROY protein. TGen researchers have linked TROY to the cellular mechanisms that enable glioblastomas to invade normal brain cells, and resist anti-cancer drugs. ""New therapeutic strategies that target the molecular drivers of invasion are required for improved clinical outcome,"" said Dr. Harshil Dhruv, a TGen Research Assistant Professor and lead author of the study. ""Propentofylline may provide a pharmacologic approach to targeting TROY, inhibiting cell invasion and reducing therapeutic resistance in glioblastomas."" One of the fundamental challenges in treating brain cancer with drugs is what is known as the blood-brain barrier that separates circulating blood from the brain extracellular fluid in the central nervous system. This barrier works to protect the brain from toxins. However, this security system is so effective at protecting the brain that it prevents many life-saving drugs -- all but some small molecules -- from being able to treat cancer and other diseases of the brain. As a result, there has been little progress in recent decades in finding new effective treatments for GBM. Median survival for newly diagnosed GBM patients is only 14.6 months. Only 5 percent of patients survive more than 5 years. ""Clinical trials revealed that PPF can cross the blood-brain barrier, and has minimal side effects,"" Dr. Tran said. ""PPF could be easily translated to the clinic as an adjuvant therapy in combination with standard of care treatment for GBM patients.""

Researchers said the gains are a significant advance in their ongoing work to develop and test a practical BCI assistive technology that people with paralysis could use easily, reliably, independently, and on demand to regain control over external devices. Intracortical BCIs such as BrainGate use a tiny array of implanted electrodes to pick up the electrical activity of neurons in the motor cortex of the brain. Computers then translate those signals into digital commands that have allowed users to control electronic devices such as computers and robotic arms by simply intending to move their own arm or hand. The translation relies on a decoder, an algorithm that infers the movement intentions of the user from the patterns of their neural activity. A challenge of decoding movement intention from intracortical electrodes is that the signals change over time thus, intracortical BCIs have required frequent interruptions for decoder recalibration. Neural signal patterns can change when the electrodes move even slightly; a neuron whose signal was not previously detected can end up joining the recorded ensemble while another might become excluded. As the neural signals shift and drift, the performance of the BCI the ability of users to move a cursor or robot by thinking about the move -- will decline until the decoder can be recalibrated. This recalibration is typically performed using a special task in which the participant tries to move the cursor to prescribed targets so that movement intentions can be mapped to the new neural activity patterns. The essential advance in the new study is a set of decoder upgrades that allow the algorithm to recalibrate itself during practical BCI use without making the user stop for calibration task every time the signals change. Results of the research reported in the paper show that the new decoder preserved BCI performance much longer than before and even contributed to improving users' accurate typing speed on an on-screen keyboard. Rather than frequent pauses for recalibration, users could type for hours, pausing only when they wanted to and without the need for technicians to intervene. ""Eliminating the need to run a calibration task whenever the recorded signals change will make a clinical BCI more user-friendly and easy to use,"" said lead author Beata Jarosiewicz, assistant professor (research) of neuroscience at Brown University and the Brown Institute for Brain Science, and investigator at the Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center (PVAMC). The BrainGate team includes scientists, engineers, and clinicians from Brown, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), PVAMC, Stanford University, and Case Western Reserve University. In a particularly dramatic demonstration at the Stanford site of the pilot clinical trial, a woman identified as ""T6,"" who is diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, was able to use BrainGate for six sessions of a few hours each over the course of 42 days without any interruptions for explicit recalibration after the decoder was initialized on the first day. T6 was able to type paragraphs, pausing and unpausing the BCI on her own, while the decoder calibrated itself. ""Watching our participants use this more robust system to type on a computer screen highlights the progress being made toward a clinically useful system,"" said Dr. Leigh Hochberg, professor of engineering at Brown, director of the Center for Neurorestoration and Neurotechnology at PVAMC, director of the Neurotechnology Trials Unit at MGH Neurology, and senior author of the paper. The innovations take advantage of the information that accrues as trial participants use the system. In one innovation, dubbed ""retrospective target inference,"" the decoder analyzes the users' recent target selections to update its interpretation of the underlying neural signals that produced it. For example, if a participant is moving the cursor around to type ""B-R-A-I-N-G-A-T-E,"" Jarosiewicz said, the decoder has definitive new information about the user's movement intentions during the trajectory between each letter. For example, when the cursor was moving from B to R, the person's movement intentions can be inferred to have been directly toward the R. ""We can use that information to update the map between the neural signals and the decoder's 'understanding' of the person's movement intentions,"" Jarosiewicz said. Meanwhile, the decoder now also keeps track of the baseline levels of neural activity in the motor cortex during moments when participants have chosen to pause. Because of the changes in neural signals over time, the resting firing patterns of neurons in the motor cortex might have changed since the last pause. Keeping track of this baseline rate during pauses helps the system to start with better calibration when the user decides to turn the system back on. The third innovation is keeping track, while participants use the system, of emerging biases in the velocity of cursor movement and subtracting them out of the decoded movements. Keeping a better balance of speeds in different directions leads to more accuracy and a more intuitive user experience. The team performed several research sessions to confirm that the new innovations were making a significant and positive difference among the participants. These included asking participants to type for an hour or two in some sessions when the self-calibration innovations were engaged and some when they were turned off. Performance remained stable in sessions when the features were on, but degraded significantly when the features were off. In one of the research sessions with the innovations turned off, the researchers found that turning them back on allowed the system to rescue performance after it had been degrading for lack of the features. In principle, the improved decoder can be applied to other BCI tasks such as three-dimensional control of a robot arm or even a person's own electronically reanimated arm or hand. There are unique challenges to doing that, Jarosiewicz acknowledged, but it's a problem the team is tackling next. The goal remains to develop BrainGate into a system that would be available to people who need it, whenever they need it. ""There is still a lot of research to do,"" Hochberg said. ""With continued clinical research, we will learn how our findings extend to more participants. We want to make the system faster, easier, smaller, fully implanted, more portable, less requiring of an expert researcher or caregiver, and more nimble in its ability to provide control of external devices. ""In these studies, we are making steps toward robust and flexible communication systems for people with severely limited movement, including limited or no speech. We are also dedicated not only to enabling control over computers or robotic assistive devices, but -- for people with spinal cord injury or stroke working toward the goal of reconnecting brain to limb, allowing the powerful intracortical signals to activate fully implanted functional electrical stimulation devices, and re-enabling intuitive movement of one's own arm and hand."" Hochberg emphasized, ""Our extraordinary research participants are true pioneers. They are participating in the trial not because they hope to gain any personal benefit, but because they want to help us to develop and test a system that will help other people with paralysis in the future."" *Caution: Investigational device.

The human brain also blinks, dropping a few frames of visual information here and there. Those lapses of attention come fast maybe just once every tenth of a second. But some people may be missing more than others, according to psychologists at the University of Wisconsin (UW)-Madison. ""Intuitively we have this sense that we're viewing the world in a continuous stream, constantly taking in the same amount of information,"" says Jason Samaha, a UW-Madison doctoral student in psychology. ""So if I told people that every 100 milliseconds their brains were taking a bit of a break, I think that would surprise a lot of them."" Samaha and UW-Madison psychology Professor Brad Postle have drawn a connection between that quick blink in the visual processing system and a rhythmic pattern in the brain's electrical activity called the alpha oscillation. Alpha oscillations are regular fluctuations in the electrical activity in the back of the human brain an area that includes the visual cortex, responsible for processing signals from the eyes. These alpha oscillations rise and fall endlessly, tracing a wave-like thrum of brain activity. Recently, brain researchers demonstrated that our visual acuity is at its best when a visual stimulus appears as the alpha wave is near a certain peak. The farther from that peak, the more likely a flash of visual information falls on the retina without consciously registering on the viewer. ""That made us wonder: Maybe this is a neural marker that can predict the rate at which we sample the world visually,"" says Samaha, whose work on that marker was published recently in the journal Current Biology. ""Someone with a faster alpha oscillation has more of those peaks. It's almost as if they're sampling the world more frequently than someone with a slower alpha oscillation."" To test that idea, Samaha sat people in front of a screen and asked them to watch closely spaced flashes of light. Their alpha oscillations were recorded before and during the task. ""The flashes can be so close together that they appear to be one,"" Samaha says. ""A delay of 10 milliseconds (just one-hundredth of a second), for example, is just too fast for you to perceive two flashes."" The longer the delay between flashes, the more likely the test subjects could correctly discern two flashes from one. But the subjects began to sort themselves out based on alpha frequency. ""People with a faster alpha frequency can perceive two flashes with a significantly shorter gap between them -- maybe 25 milliseconds,"" says Samaha, ""whereas someone with a slower alpha frequency can't perceive two flashes until they have closer to 45 milliseconds delay."" The faster the regular rhythm of the working brain (represented by alpha oscillation), the more fine-grained the resolution in visual perception. Of course, precious few discrete events take place within a couple dozen milliseconds. Blinking eyelids can take 400 milliseconds -- a relatively pregnant pause -- to close and reopen. But in cases where physical reaction time is at a premium, every bit helps. Samaha thinks of a baseball player. In the 400 milliseconds it takes a professionally thrown fastball to reach the plate, the batter has to budget time for locating the baseball, identifying its spin, deciding whether and where to swing, and actually whipping the bat around to the right spot. ""In a very brief window of time, you have to choose to begin a reaction and where to direct it,"" says Samaha. ""Having finer resolution may help in cases like that. Maybe good hitters -- and other people who can react quickly to a visual stimulus -- have very fast alpha oscillations."" World Series outcomes aside, Samaha sees the study's results contributing to deeper discussions of how we relate to the world around us. ""The more interesting implications of the research concern what constitutes our conscious visual perception of the world,"" he says. ""We seem to find a neural marker of conscious visual updating, and that's interesting to a lot of people who are looking for neural correlates of consciousness.""

But when people with anxiety sensitivity also have asthma, their suffering can be far more debilitating and dangerous, because they have difficulty managing their asthma. A new study explores this issue and recommends treatment to help decrease asthma symptoms. The study by Alison McLeish, a University of Cincinnati (UC) associate professor of psychology, Christina Luberto, a recent doctoral graduate from UC and clinical fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, and Emily O'Bryan, a graduate student in the UC Department of Psychology, will be presented at the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT) 49th Annual Convention that takes place Nov. 12-15, 2015 in Chicago. The researchers recruited 101 college undergraduates who reported having asthma. The experiment aimed to mimic asthma symptoms by having study participants breathe in-and-out through a narrow straw, about the width of a coffee-stirrer straw. As expected, people who reported higher anxiety sensitivity not only reported greater anxiety during the straw-breathing task, but also experienced greater asthma symptoms and decreased lung function. ""Anxiety sensitivity not only helps explain why we see higher rates of anxiety disorders, but also why anxiety is associated with poorer asthma outcomes,"" says McLeish. As a result, the study recommended interventions for anxiety sensitivity such as exposure therapy aimed at reducing the anxiety. Safety controls were in place during the straw-breathing exercise and all participants were required to have their inhalers with them in case they experienced an asthma attack. Students were told they could stop at any time during the straw-breathing exercise. The UC presentation at the ABCT Convention is part of a Nov. 14 symposium titled, ""Motivation Escape and Avoidant Coping: The Impact of Distress Intolerance on Health Behaviors.""

This is the first longitudinal, population-based study that investigated early lead exposure to sleep problems. The findings are set for publication in the December issue of SLEEP.  Little is known about the impact of heavy metals exposure on children s sleep, but the study s findings highlight that environmental toxins such as lead are important pediatric risk factors for sleep disturbance,  said the study s principal investigator Jianghong Liu, PhD, FAAN, Associate Professor at Penn Nursing and a faculty member at Penn s Perelman School of Medicine.  Lead exposure is preventable and treatable, but if left unchecked can result in irreversible neurological damage.  This is an important advancement in identifying and understanding the contribution of lead exposure to childhood insomnia and daytime sleepiness. Sleep problems are highly prevalent in children and adolescents and are associated with many adverse health outcomes including developmental disorders and intellectual and neurocognitive problems.  This study addresses an important but often neglected area of sleep science, namely, environmental factors that disrupt sleep biology and behavior in children and other vulnerable populations,  said the study s senior author David Dinges, PhD, Professor and Chief of the Division of Sleep & Chronobiology in the Department of Psychiatry at Penn Medicine. The sleep problems reported by the adolescents in the study include excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, early morning awakening, trouble initiating and maintaining sleep, and having to use sleeping pills, all of which highlight poor sleep quality. Using the data from the cohort study, 665 children s blood lead levels were assessed when they were between three and five years old, and sleep was assessed six years later, when the children were between nine and eleven years old. The children and their parents answered separate questionnaires about the children s daily sleep patterns, insomnia and the use of sleeping pills. Child-reported insomnia and use of sleeping pills were two times and three times more prevalent in children with blood lead levels (BLL) greater than or equal to 10 ug/dL than in children with BLL less than 10 ug/dL. This suggests that sleep disturbances appeared problematic enough for children to suffer from insomnia and even to use sleeping aids/pills in an attempt to ameliorate their symptoms.  Insufficient sleep and daytime sleepiness is very prevalent in children and adolescents, and it is a pervasive problem that is linked with a significant public health burden,  explained Liu.  More research needs to be done to identify contributing factors and ways to prevent or reduce their impact. Doing this can not only help alleviate sleep disturbance, but can also indirectly improve sleep-related health outcomes, including cognition, emotion, behavior, and in some cases, diabetes.

The best known of such diseases is Alzheimer's disease (AD), but there are many others that are receiving increased scrutiny, in part because of mounting evidence linking them to atherosclerosis and aging. The findings, which appear in the Journal of Molecular Biology, may ultimately lead to the development of therapeutic targets for one of these diseases. A group of disorders, called amyloid diseases, occurs due to proteins that form abnormal clumps and deposit in different organs, causing damage to the brain (AD, Parkinson's disease), heart (cardiac amyloidosis), kidney, liver and other vital organs. One such protein called apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1) forms the scaffold of the so-called ""good cholesterol,"" or high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Normally, apoA-1/HDL removes excess cholesterol and other fats from the body and is protective against cardiovascular disease. However, when mutations or other errors occur within this protein, apoA-1 has the potential to aggregate and manifest as familial form of amyloidosis, which is a life-threatening incurable disease. ApoA-I can also deposit in arteries, thereby contributing to atherosclerosis. While the medical community has known for some time that abnormal proteins can cause disease due to exposed vulnerable ""hot spots"" that clump together, there has been a lack of understanding about how a ""good"" protein can become so ""bad,"" especially at a molecular level. Using cutting-edge technology to study the dynamic behavior and molecular shape of apoA-1 and its various mutant forms, researchers at Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) and Northeastern University were surprised to discover that exposed ""hot spots"" in apoA-I do not always cause amyloid disease. Some mutations led to decreased protection in other vulnerable parts, which helped the body to get rid of the protein before it clumps. These mutations in apoA-I did not cause amyloid disease in humans. The researchers suggest that this finding is not limited to apoA-I but possibly applies to other amyloid-forming proteins. Surprisingly, some mutations occurring at one end of the protein acted like ""molecular remote-controls"" and changed the structure and activity of the other end. According to the researchers, solving the puzzle of the molecular changes that cause amyloid diseases has important implications for potential treatments. ""If one could predict what makes any given protein to form amyloid, one could begin to design tools to decelerate or even block this pathogenic process before it starts,"" explained corresponding author Olga Gursky, PhD, professor of Physiology and Biophysics at BUSM.

The probes designed by OGT target each SNP allele, with the intensity ratio following hybridization allowing reliable detection of LOH. To ensure robust and high-resolution LOH analysis, each probe set has undergone extensive optimization and validation. Vice President of Operations at BMGL, Mr. Sean Kim, commented:  We are dedicated to the rapid delivery of the most accurate genetic analyses. Through the application of OGT s technology, we are now able to provide reliable array-based analysis of both copy number variation and loss of heterozygosity for challenging samples. We are now also looking to other areas of genetic analysis, expanding the use of this technology toward our complete portfolio.  OGT s SNP probe technology is a key component of its extensive range of aCGH arrays covering multiple application areas, including cancer and constitutional research. The latest product in development utilizing this technology is the CytoSure Constitutional v3 +SNP array, which provides enhanced exon-level coverage of all developmental disorders. As a fully comprehensive approach to its genetic analysis strategy, BMGL also utilizes OGT s Cytocell FISH probes, and following a significant and successful validation programme, plans to further extend the use of these probes. Dr Mike Evans, CEO of OGT commented:  Through granting the license, we are proud to be advancing the capabilities of such a prominent organization as the BMGL with our SNP array probe technology and Cytocell FISH probes.

The key may be to inject viruses that carry the codes for the gene products into the ventricles, which are fluid-filled compartments in the center of the brain that serve as a plumbing system.  Batten disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, one of a group of diseases that causes problems with a cell s ability to breakdown specific molecules. Early symptoms may include vision loss, subtle changes in personality and behavior, slow learning, clumsiness, or stumbling. Eventually, the children become blind, bedridden and demented, and typically die within the first decade of their lives. Currently there are no effective treatments.  Our study opens up the possibility of a one-and-done treatment for this form of Batten disease,  said Beverly Davidson, Ph.D., director of the Raymond G. Perelman Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics at Children s Hospital of Philadelphia and the senior author of the study. Working with scientists at the University of Missouri, Columbia, Davidson s team focused on the late infantile form of the disease that starts in children 2 to 4 years of age and is most often caused by mutations in the gene for the soluble lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), an enzyme which degrades proteins. They showed that if they treated dogs that have a similar disorder by injecting a safe virus containing the TPP1 gene code into the cerebrospinal fluid that fills ventricles, the dogs lived about twice as long as untreated dogs. Symptoms including problems with movement, pupil dilation and making decisions were delayed or, in some cases, did not occur. The treatment, however, did not fully improve the dogs  vision suggesting that delivery to the eye itself may be necessary as well. When the scientists inspected the dogs  brains, they found that the treatment reduced the damage normally caused by the disease. In comparison with untreated dogs, the treated dogs had less reactive glial cells and stored lipofuscins, fatty deposits that are hallmarks of Batten disease and similar disorders, called neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses.  Dr. Davidson and her team undertook a highly innovative approach for Batten disease gene therapy,  said Jill Morris, Ph.D., program director at NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.  These results open up a promising path toward developing long-lasting treatments for Batten disease and similar lysosomal storage disorders.  Further inspections of the dogs  brains confirmed the scientists  hypothesis about how the therapy worked. The results suggested that parenchymal cells that line the ventricles and surface of the brain took up the injected genes from the cerebrospinal fluid and made more TPP1 protein. These cells then secreted the protein that, in turn, spread throughout the brain. Initial experiments showed the importance treating the dogs with the immunosuppressant, mycophenolate mofetil, before injecting the TPP1 gene. The immunosuppressant prevented the production of antibodies that accelerated TPP1 clearance from the cerebrospinal fluid.  We saw profound effects from the gene therapy that, summed up, improved the dogs  health. We certainly hope that this approach will provide children suffering from this disorder similar benefits,  said Dr. Davidson.","Published: November 13, 2015"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/essential-component-of-antiviral-defense-identified-193696,Essential Component of Antiviral Defense Identified Infectious disease researchers at the University of Georgia have identified a signaling protein critical for host defense against influenza infection   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The findings shed light on how a single component of the body's defense system promotes effective immunity against viral infections -- particularly respiratory viruses -- that affect mucosal sites. The protein tumor progression locus 2, or Tpl2, is an important regulator of the immune response, controlling signaling downstream of cell surface and intracellular receptors that recognize the presence of pathogens. Tpl2 regulates the production of a group of immune signaling proteins called interferons. Though interferon production is known to play a large role in host defense against viral infections, prior to this study little was known about how Tpl2 functions in that environment. The study demonstrates a key role for Tpl2 in induction of antiviral genes, including Type III interferons, a type of immune signaling protein, important in mediating antiviral responses.""Tpl2 regulates inflammation and inflammation is a necessary part of a host's defense against infection,"" said Wendy Watford, corresponding author on the study and an associate professor of infectious diseases in the UGA College of Veterinary Medicine. Ongoing projects in Watford's lab seek to understand how Tpl2 modulates the host immune response in different disease settings. Watford and Teneema Kuriakose, her former graduate student and lead author on the study who is now a postdoctoral research associate in the department of immunology at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, collaborated with Ralph Tripp, a professor and GRA Eminent Scholar of infectious diseases, to study influenza virus infection in mice in which the gene that encodes Tpl2 had been removed. The Tpl2 knockout mice were more susceptible to influenza infection, exhibiting an average of tenfold higher amounts of virus in the lungs compared to mice with functional Tpl2. At the same time that lung viral titers were high in the Tpl2 knockout mice, the number of cytotoxic T cells--an adaptive immune cell that is key to clearing influenza from the lungs -- was significantly reduced. Although Tpl2 knockout mice produced the Type I interferons that are important players in host antiviral responses at levels equivalent to those seen in wild-type mice, they produced diminished levels of Type III interferons. This finding is important, as Type III interferons are highly expressed at mucosal sites, and are now appreciated to be the most prominent interferon type produced during influenza infection. ""Type III interferons, which are relative newcomers to the field of interferons, are functionally related to the Type I interferons and induce similar antiviral responses,"" Watford said. ""We are currently investigating whether Tpl2 regulation of Type III interferon production is an essential component of host resistance to influenza."" The results of this study go a long way toward helping understand the host immune response not just to influenza, but also to other viruses that infect mucosal sites, such as respiratory syncytial virus and rotavirus. This understanding of how the body fights such viruses could help guide the design of more effective countermeasures against viral infections. However, more work needs to be done to fully understand how Tpl2 modulates the immune response during viral infections. ""Ultimately the goal is to generate better vaccines so that we can drive immunologic memory and protect people against subsequent infections,"" Watford said.","Published: November 13, 2015"

The moneys will be used to finance CE-marking by early 2017 of the company s lead immunoassay PreDx Ad for early detection of MCI and Alzheimer s. EUR 1 million has been provided in grants by Innovation Norway with a contribution in the form of soft funding from industry partners F rst Medical Laboratory and Akershus University Hospital AHUS) in Norway. The company also announced that a new grant application is underway, with a third equity issue planned in 2016, to raise a further EUR 1.5 million to fund intervention trials with medical nutrition. PreDx Ad is a blood-based assay for beta-Amyloid protein degradation products developed from leading research by Professor Tormod Fladby of AHUS. In Alzheimer s disease, beta-Amyloid accumulates in the diseased brain and destroys the nerve cells, a process that eventually leads to dementia. Professor Fladby has shown there is reduced clearance of this protein in the cells responsible for removing beta-Amyloid, namely the macrophages. These can be collected by a blood sample and by showing reduced degradation products of beta-Amyloid early in the disease development in turn open the possibility of earlier intervention. Already a prototype blood assay has indicated that the assay has the potential to perform with similar accuracy to current spinal fluid tests.  With the new funding, we now aim to develop the prototype fully into a commercial product. The clinical accuracy of the new blood based diagnostic test will be documented in accordance with the European IVD regulations by an ongoing multinational clinical study,  says CEO H kon S ter y. Akershus University Hospital will lead the study and include samples from 300 Alzheimer cases and controls, focusing primarily on the early predementia disease stages such as MCI. All included patients will undergo full clinical evaluation for dementia, including spinal fluid tests and advanced imaging procedures, in addition to blood sampling and testing with the new method.  It is now widely accepted that a new blood-based test with high accuracy in the early disease stages is essential to accelerate effective drug development and intervention within the Alzheimer s space. Pre Diagnostics aims to develop stable blood-based tests that effectively demonstrate any intervention effect on the key disease mechanisms. Thus we are looking to provide a patient recruitment and companion diagnostics tool, not only for drug therapies, but also accessible intervention products, such as high-dose Omega-3.  continues CEO H kon S ter y.","Published: November 13, 2015"

The two new reports from Doudna s lab and that of UC Berkeley colleague Robert Tjian show in much greater detail how the Cas9 protein searches through billions of base pairs in a cell to find the right DNA sequence, and how Cas9 determines whether to bind, or bind and cut, thereby initiating gene editing. Based on these experiments, Cas9 appears to have at least three ways of checking to make sure it finds the right target DNA before it takes the irrevocable step of making a cut.  CRISPR-Cas9 has evolved for accurate DNA targeting, and we now understand the molecular basis for its seek-and-cleave activity, which helps limit off-target DNA editing,  said Doudna, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at UC Berkeley and professor of molecular and cell biology and of chemistry. Tjian is president of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a UC Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology. The studies also illustrate how well CRISPR/Cas9 works in human and animal cells   eukaryotes   even though  the technique was invented by bacteria to protect themselves from getting the flu,  Doudna said. CRISPR-Cas9 is a hybrid of protein and RNA   the cousin to DNA   that functions as an efficient search-and-snip system in bacteria. It arose as a way to recognize and kill viruses, but Doudna and Charpentier realized that it could also work well in other cells, including humans, to facilitate genome editing. The Cas9 protein, obtained from the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, functions together with a  guide  RNA that targets a complementary 20-nucleotide stretch of DNA. Once the RNA identifies a sequence matching these nucleotides, Cas9 cuts the double-stranded DNA helix. One study tracked Cas9-RNA molecules though the nucleus of mammalian cells as they rapidly searched through the entire genome to find and bind just the region targeted and no other.  It s crazy that the Cas9 complex manages to scan the vast space of eukaryotic genomes,  said graduate student Spencer Knight, first author of the paper. Previous studies had suggested that there are many similar-looking DNA regions that Cas9 could bind and cut, which could limit its usefulness if precision were important. These off-target regions might share as few as four or five nucleotides with the 20-nucleotide primer, just enough for Cas9 to recognize.  There is a lot of off-target binding by Cas9, but we found that these interactions are very brief   from milliseconds to seconds   before Cas9 moves on,  he said. Because these exploratory bindings   perhaps as many as 300,000 of them   are often very short-lived, a few thousand CRISPR-Cas9 complexes can scour the entire genome to find one targeted stretch of DNA. Cas9 must also recognize a short three-base-pair DNA sequence immediately following the primer sequence, dubbed PAM, which occurs about 300 million times within the human genome.  If Cas9 bound for tens of seconds or minutes at each off-target site, it would never, ever be able to find a target and cut in a timely manner,  Knight said. Cas9 s final checkpoint The other study, published online Oct. 28 in Nature, showed that once Cas9 binds to a region of DNA, it performs another check before two distant sections of the Cas9 protein complex come together, like the blades of a scissors, to precisely align the active sites that cut double-stranded DNA.  We found that RNA-guided Cas9 can bind some off-target DNA sequences, which differ from the correct target by just a few mutations, very tightly. Surprisingly, though, the region of Cas9 that does the cutting is inhibited because of the imperfect match. But when the correctly matching DNA is located, Cas9 undergoes a large structural change that releases this inhibition and triggers DNA cutting,  said first author Samuel Sternberg, who recently received his Ph.D. at UC Berkeley. He was able to observe these changes using a fluorescently labeled version of the Cas9 complex.  We think that this structural change is the last checkpoint, or proofreading stage, of the DNA targeting reaction,  he said.  First, Cas9 recognizes a short DNA segment next to the target   the PAM   then the target DNA is matched up with the guide RNA via Watson-Crick base-pairing. Finally, when a perfect match is identified, the last part of the protein swings into place to enable cutting and initiate genome editing.  A smaller Cas9 protein from a different species of bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, likely exploits the same strategy to improve the precision of DNA targeting, suggesting that  this important feature has been preserved throughout evolutionary time,  he added.  This is good news, in that it suggests that you have more than one checkpoint to ensure correct Cas9 binding,  Knight said.  There s not just sequence regulation, there is also temporal regulation: it has to engage with the DNA and park long enough that it can actually rearrange and cut.  The discoveries from Doudna, Tjian and their teams shed light on the molecular basis of off-target effects during genome editing applications, and may guide the future design of more accurate Cas9 variants.","Published: November 13, 2015"

Using imaging techniques, Walsh demonstrated that before HSV moves using dynein, the virus depends on the dynamic nature of microtubules for capture. He observed that these microtubules, which dynamically grow and shrink to sense the intracellular environment, capture virus particles using specialized tracking proteins, EB1 and CLIP-170, at the tips of the microtubules.  The virus actually sits at the periphery of the cell, and the proteins at the tip of the microtubules hook it and grab it on to the microtubule,  Walsh said.  Up until now, it would be assumed the virus could get on any part of the microtubule as long as it s on a motor, but that doesn t seem to be the case.  This finding has  changed the way we think about how the virus gets on the microtubule,  Walsh said. Furthermore, when the scientists observed other structures within the cell, such as proteins and organelles that depend on microtubules and motor proteins for transport, they found these structures do not need the tracking proteins EB1 and CLIP-170. This finding suggests that these specialized proteins that are required for HSV infection could serve as potential targets in the development of new antivirals. In future research, Walsh plans to study the mechanisms of how the virus targets tracking proteins and engages microtubules.","Published: November 13, 2015"

The malaria parasite is becoming increasingly resistant to the drug artemisinin as the front-line treatment to combat the mosquito-borne disease, even though artemisinin is given as a combination therapy with another antimalarial drug. The USF research provides a better understanding how antimalarial drugs work, thus adding ammunition in the race to overcome the spread of multidrug-resistant malaria -- a public health threat that could potentially undermine the success of global malaria control efforts. The global health researchers used a collection of malaria parasite mutants that each had altered metabolism linked to defect in a single P. falciparum gene. They then screened 53 drugs and compounds against 71 of these P. falciparum piggyBac single insertion mutant parasites. Computational analysis of the response patterns linked the different antimalarial drug candidates and metabolic inhibitors to the specific gene defect. This novel chemogenomic profiling revealed new insights into the drugs' mechanisms of action and most importantly identified six new genes critically involved P. falciparum'sresponse to artemisinin, but with increased susceptibility to the drugs tested. ""That represents six new targets potentially as effective as artemisinin for killing the malaria parasite,"" said the study's co-senior author Dennis Kyle, PhD, a Distinguished USF Health Professor in the Department of Global Health, USF College of Public Health. ""There is definitely a sense of urgency for discovering new antimalarial drugs that may replace artemisinin, or work better with artemisinin, to prevent or delay drug resistance."" The multi-faceted team of USF scientists worked with researchers from the University of Notre Dame's Eck Institute for Global Health to undertake the chemogenomic profiling of P. falciparum for the first time. ""The methodology used in the study highlights the importance of team-based interdisciplinary research for cutting-edge scientific innovation by combining the tools of drug discovery methods with functional genomics and computational biology analysis. We are very happy to have such an important result published in the first year of a five-year NIH grant,"" said co-senior author John Adams, PhD, professor of global health in the USF College of Public Health. ""Equally important are the enormous efforts by the cadre of talented postdoctoral researchers and graduate students who were critical for making this type of challenging scientific study a success."" ""That interdisciplinary collaboration is where the power of this work comes to light,"" Dr. Kyle said. ""It helps us develop the tools, the molecular techniques we need to rapidly mine huge amounts of data and to discover new drug targets in ways not previously feasible."" P. falciparum causes three-quarters of all malaria cases in Africa, and 95 percent of malaria deaths worldwide. It is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito, which injects the one-celled malaria parasites from its salivary glands into the person's bloodstream. Half the world's population is at risk of contracting malaria, so any decrease in artemisinin's effectiveness could result in more deaths.","Published: November 13, 2015"

RNA is one of three macromolecules -- along with DNA and proteins -- essential to all forms of life. By understanding how hnRNP A1 binds to RNA, the scientists may find ways to jam up components of the replication machinery when the protein is coopted by disease. The team of scientists reveals the mechanism used by the protein, hnRNP A1 to link to the section of RNA, called the 'hairpin loop.'  They found that hnRNP A1, a protein essential to cell function and virus replication, has a significantly different structure than its only previously known form: binding to DNA. ""We solved the three-dimensional structure of the protein bound to an RNA hairpin derived from the HIV virus,"" said Blanton Tolbert, a chemistry professor at Case Western Reserve. ""But because the hairpin loop is found in other viruses and throughout healthy cells, our findings may help explain how the protein connects to the other hairpin targets."" Tolbert began this research six years ago, frustrated that the only information available was the structure of the protein bound to a synthetic DNA, which isn't its natural target. Proteins that bind hairpins sense both the structure and the sequence information presented in the loop. The structure of the DNA complex did not demonstrate the molecular recognition that must take place to bind RNA hairpins. The process To discover the structure bound to RNA, the researchers combined three techniques: X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small angle x-ray scattering. Each technique yielded a piece of the puzzle. To bind to RNA, hnRNP A1 has two domains, RRM1 and RRM2, which are akin to hands. Scientists already knew both hands are needed to connect to RNA. But the researchers found that, instead of each domain grabbing a section of the loop, only RRM1 makes contact with the RNA. RRM2 acts as support, helping organize RRM1 into the structure needed to conform to a certain section of the loop. To confirm that the structures are key to binding, the researchers inserted mutations by changing amino acids on the surface of the domains. Surprisingly, mutations on the far side of RRM1 -- the surface not in contact with the RNA but with the RRM2 -- caused decoupling at that site and substantially weakened the affinity for RNA. Without the normal connection between the two domains, RRM1 fails to adopt the geometric shape that conforms to the RNA hairpin loop. The researchers are further investigating how the protein transmits the effects of RRM2 to RRM1 and bind. They are also exploring the development of antagonistic agents that would disrupt the interaction of the protein with viruses.","Published: November 13, 2015"

Proton spin resonance is the next big step that will open up applications in chemistry and biology."" To foster the development of these applications, Freeman's team plans to openly share the information about how to execute this technique, feeding the current maker movement. It was important to the team not to patent this discovery--as is often the pressure for scientists conducting these types of discoveries--but instead to publish their findings in a scientific journal to provide open-source access that will advance the field. ""Ultimately, the way science makes progress is through people sharing discoveries,"" says Freeman, adding that he hopes others will adapt the technology for their own needs. Freeman, who worked for IBM before coming to the University of Alberta, believes that chip-based miniaturizable mechanical devices--by virtue of their small scale and superior performance--will come to replace some electronic sensors in devices like smart phones and on space exploration probes. ""It's an elegant solution to a challenging problem, simple but not obvious,"" says Freeman, who has been working on the experimental challenge solved in this paper for the past two decades. ""Working in condensed matter physics is like having the best seat at an awe-inspiring parade of progress.""","Published: November 13, 2015"

The study is the first to systematically show how designer brain receptors and designer drugs work together to change how cues for food stimulate motivation. The findings, which may help scientists to fight addiction, overeating and other habitual behavior in humans, appear in the European Journal of Neuroscience. In everyday life, we are bombarded with advertisements, or cues, that garner our attention and trigger us into purchasing products, or rewards. Consequently, these reward-paired cues can become attractive themselves. For example McDonald's golden arches can produce cravings for fast food even though you haven't seen the food or aren't even hungry. Scientists study this phenomenon using sign-tracking, or autoshaping, an experimental conditioning in which the reward is given regardless of the subject's behavior. ""Although we have a sense of what brain circuits mediate reward, less is known about the neural circuitry underlying the transfer of value to cues associated with rewards,"" says lead author Stephen Chang, a postdoctoral fellow. ""We were primarily interested in whether the ventral pallidum, a brain region implicated in processing reward, is also involved in sign-tracking."" Previously, it was impossible to inactivate brain areas like this repeatedly and temporarily to study how cues become valuable in themselves. But it is now possible with a new technology called DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs). Your brain cells are loaded with natural receptors, or molecules like jigsaw puzzles that are activated when another molecule arrives that fits like a missing piece. But DREADDs are engineered receptors introduced into neurons using viruses. Injection of a synthetic drug can activate these receptors, thus shutting down the neurons as a sort of remote control. This technology allowed the Dartmouth researchers to inactivate the ventral pallidum repeatedly and temporarily during tests in which a lever was inserted into the experimental chamber for 10 seconds, followed by a food pellet reward when the lever was withdrawn. Even though the food was delivered regardless of the rats' behavior, the rats pressed and bit the lever as if it were the reward itself. The results showed that activating DREADDs in the ventral pallidum before each training session blocked that behavior. In addition, recordings of individual neurons in the ventral pallidum following DREADD activation showed that ventral pallidum activity can become suppressed or excited to varying speeds and amounts. ""These results are the first to show that the ventral pallidum is necessary for the attribution of value to cues that are paired with rewards,"" Chang says. ""This is surprising because the ventral pallidum was historically considered to be just an area for expressing motivations in behavior. In terms of clinical applications, the results carry the potential for stripping away value from reward-paired cues in cases such as addiction. The ventral pallidum is a novel target for such work.""

A study of two models of intellectual disability in mice has found that they share similar disease mechanisms. Researchers found that treatment with a statin drug called lovastatin commonly used to treat high cholesterol can correct high levels of protein production in the brain linked to the conditions. The findings suggest that different types of intellectual disabilities may benefit from common therapeutic approaches, the researchers say. Studies of people with learning disabilities have identified a wide range of genetic causes. Around a third of people affected also have symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying these conditions may be shared. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh studied mice with a genetic mutation that means they produce lower levels of a protein called SynGAP. The mice show learning and behavioral difficulties and act as a model system to understand why people with mutations in the human version of the gene suffer from intellectual disability. The team from the University's Patrick Wild Centre and Centre for Integrative Physiology found that treatment with lovastatin normalized levels of protein production in the brains of the mice. Their results suggest that lovastatin acts by reducing levels of the active form of a protein called ERK1/2. They compared their findings with mice that lack a protein called FMRP, which also causes cellular and behavioral changes that can be rescued with lovastatin. Loss of FMRP in people leads to Fragile X Syndrome, the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and autism. Further research is needed to determine whether the treatment can restore learning and development in people. Professor David Wyllie, Director of the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Integrative Physiology, said: ""This study shows that the core deficits associated with two very different causes of intellectual disability are shared. This is important because it means that people with diverse types of intellectual disability or autism may benefit from the same treatment."" Professor Peter Kind, Director of the University of Edinburgh's Patrick Wild Centre for Research into Autism, Fragile X Syndrome and Intellectual Disabilities, said: ""Statins, such as lovastatin, are already used widely for treating people, including children, for high cholesterol with minimal side effects.

Exposure and response prevention therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy in which the patient is asked to confront triggers that give rise to their obsessions in order to refrain from performing the rituals in response to these obsessions. OCD is marked by the performing of ""rituals"" to decrease distress related to one's obsessions such as excessive hand-washing to cope with a fixation on hand hygiene, for example. ""We know that exposure and response prevention therapy (EX/RP) can benefit these patients,"" said lead author, Carmen McLean, PhD, an assistant professor of clinical psychology in the department of Psychiatry at the Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety at Penn. ""But this study showed that EX/RP is also effective for OCD sufferers who do not benefit sufficiently from common drug treatments for OCD."" A previous study compared the effects of adding risperidone, pill placebo, and up to 17 twice-weekly therapist-led sessions of EX/RP to medication for OCD. ""We found compared to patients who received medication or placebo, those who received EX/RP showed significantly more reductions in OCD symptoms and depression, as well as significantly more increases in insight, quality of life, and social function after only eight weeks,"" McLean said. The current study included 32 patients who crossed over to receive 17 weeks of EX/RP treatment after not benefitting sufficiently from risperidone. Evaluation at 12 and 16 weeks showed significant symptom improvement, with 25 (78 percent) of patients completing treatment; 17 (53 percent) of them were classified as treatment responders and 11 (34 percent) classified as excellent responders at a 32-week follow-up evaluation. The remaining patients required medication changes during the follow-up period, which enabled them to shift to excellent-responder status.

The model is called ANNABELL (Artificial Neural Network with Adaptive Behavior Exploited for Language Learning) and it is described in an article published in PLOS ONE. This research sheds light on the neural processes that underlie the development of language. How does our brain develop the ability to perform complex cognitive functions, such as those needed for language and reasoning? This is a question that certainly we are all asking ourselves, to which the researchers are not yet able to give a complete answer. We know that in the human brain there are about one hundred billion neurons that communicate by means of electrical signals. We learned a lot about the mechanisms of production and transmission of electrical signals among neurons. There are also experimental techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, which allow us to understand which parts of the brain are most active when we are involved in different cognitive activities. But a detailed knowledge of how a single neuron works and what are the functions of the various parts of the brain is not enough to give an answer to the initial question. We might think that the brain works in a similar way to a computer: after all, even computers work through electrical signals. In fact, many researchers have proposed models based on the analogy brain-is-like-a-computer since the late '60s. However, apart from the structural differences, there are profound differences between the brain and a computer, especially in learning and information processing mechanisms. Computers work through programs developed by human programmers. In these programs there are coded rules that the computer must follow in handling the information to perform a given task. However there is no evidence of the existence of such programs in our brain. In fact, today many researchers believed that our brain is able to develop higher cognitive skills simply by interacting with the environment, starting from very little innate knowledge. The ANNABELL model appears to confirm this perspective. ANNABELL does not have pre-coded language knowledge; it learns only through communication with a human interlocutor, thanks to two fundamental mechanisms, which are also present in the biological brain: synaptic plasticity and neural gating. Synaptic plasticity is the ability of the connection between two neurons to increase its efficiency when the two neurons are often active simultaneously, or nearly simultaneously. This mechanism is essential for learning and for long-term memory. Neural gating mechanisms are based on the properties of certain neurons (called bistable neurons) to behave as switches that can be turned 'on' or 'off' by a control signal coming from other neurons. When turned on, the bistable neurons transmit the signal from a part of the brain to another, otherwise they block it. The model is able to learn, due to synaptic plasticity, to control the signals that open and close the neural gates, so as to control the flow of information among different areas. The cognitive model has been validated using a database of about 1500 input sentences, based on literature on early language development, and has responded by producing a total of about 500 sentences in output, containing nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, and other word classes, demonstrating the ability to express a wide range of capabilities in human language processing.

This is a first for brain imaging, said Shi, a research associate in City College's Institute for Ultrafast Spectroscopy and Lasers, and the biology department. The breakthrough holds promise for the noninvasive study of the brain and breasts in greater detail than possible today. Working with Distinguished Professor of Physics Robert R. Alfano and Adrian Rodriguez-Contreras, an assistant professor of biology, Shi's team proved theoretically and experimentally that deep imaging of the brain is possible using light at wavelength 1600-1880 nm (nanometer). This is dubbed the ""Golden Window"" for imaging. In the past, near-infrared (NIR) radiation has been employed using one and two-photon fluorescence imaging at wavelengths 650-950 nm for deep brain imaging. This is known as optical window 1. Shi, who holds a PhD in biomedical engineering, said the current research introduces three new optical windows in the NIR region. And she demonstrates the windows' potential for deeper brain tissue imaging due to the reduction of scattering that causes blurring.

As wheat is one of the world s most vital crops, the new genomics resources will help secure future food supplies.  The wheat genome is now assembled into fewer and much larger chunks of DNA and covers regions that previous assemblies did not reach, such as complicated highly repetitive regions that form about 80 per cent of the DNA sequences.  Furthermore , said Matt Clark, Group Leader at TGAC (Co-Principal Investigator on the grant), who led the sequencing work,  wheat has a very large and complex genome made by the hybridisation of three closely related grasses, each of which has a large genome itself. It s has been a complex problem that has confounded scientists for several years.  Reaching this milestone has been a major UK-based effort to identify and understand wheat genes and develop insights into the links between them to aid breeding programmes. In this latest development, billions of bases needed to be sequenced and the assembly (a gigantic jigsaw puzzle using billions of pieces that are very similar to each other) took three weeks to complete on one of the UK s largest supercomputers, which was specially configured for work on wheat.  To assemble the wheat genome, Bernardo Clavijo, Algorithms Research and Development Team Leader at TGAC, made major modifications to a software, called DISCOVAR, developed by the Broad Institute, Cambridge US, (previously used for specialist applications in human genome assembly) in a collaboration established by Federica Di Palma, Director of Science of TGAC and Visiting Scientist at the Broad Institute. In order to ensure all the complexity of the DNA sequence was preserved during assembly, he made a series of major overhauls to the software:  We centred our approach on achieving maximal coverage of the genome, by distinguishing repeats. We were very careful to use newly generated high-quality input data.  These advances now mean the software can assemble several wheat genomes with high speed and great precision. This sets the stage for rapidly generating useful assemblies of many varieties of wheat, which is an essential step for breeding and research. Mike Bevan from the John Innes Centre (JIC) (Co-Principal Investigator), said:  The capacity to sequence and assemble many wheat genomes efficiently breaks down major barriers to wheat crop improvement. We will now be able to exploit genetic variation from ancestral wheat varieties for crop improvement in new ways.  Ksenia Krasileva, Group Leader at TGAC and TSL, who has conducted an initial assessment of the assemblies, said:  One of the most complex and large groups of genes in wheat are those that contribute to the nutritional and bread-making quality of the grain. These are all present in complete copies in the genome, suggesting other hard-to-assemble genes are also accurately represented.  Steve Visscher, Deputy Chief Executive of the Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council (BBSRC), who funded the project, said:  BBSRC is delighted to have supported this work, which has made an important contribution to the G20-sponsored international Wheat Initiative. Many research groups are contributing to the global research effort to develop a fully assembled and aligned wheat genome sequence to access, understand and apply the richness of wheat genetic diversity to increase wheat yield, improve wheat s tolerance to stresses, pathogens and pests, and improve the sustainability wheat production. It is fitting that this important step in unravelling the complex wheat genome, which is five times the size of the human genome, has adapted specialist software developed for the human genome assembly.  The early release of the data as a new resource for the world wheat researchers and breeders reflects the Wheat Initiative s founding principles of sharing data and seeking synergy through collaboration to help tackle the global grand challenge of feeding a population of nearly 10 billion by 2050. The data will be available for sequence searches (BLAST) at TGAC s Grassroot Genomics platform from November 12 2015. The full data set, with genes identified, will be publicly available from the European Bioinformatics Institute s (EBI) Ensembl database at the end of 2015. This is a key milestone in the BBSRC funded research project  Triticeae Genomics for Sustainable Agriculture  in collaboration with TGAC, JIC, the European Bioinformatics Institute and Rothamsted Research.

But that promise comes with a risk: the possibility that transplanted hPSCs might also develop as unwanted tumors. In a new study researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine describe a new  progenitor cell  capable of unlimited expansion and differentiation into mature kidney cells, but without the risk of forming tumors.  This work nicely complements recent advances in tissue engineering and the goal of rebuilding or recreating functional organs, such as what we ve seen with the creation of  mini-kidneys ,  said senior author Karl Willert, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at UC San Diego.  It represents a novel source of cells.  Willert, with co-corresponding author David Brafman, PhD, at Arizona State University, and colleagues engineered anin vitro microenvironment that permitted homogenous expansion of hPSC progenitor cells from the mesoderm   one of the three primary germ layers in early embryonic development. A germ layer is a primary layer of cells that form during embryogenesis. Progenitor cells are early descendants of stem cells, with more limited differentiation capacity. Analyses showed that these newly created  mesoderm progenitors  lacked tumor-forming potential, but retained the capacity to differentiate into specific kinds of tissue, such as cells that comprise the adult kidney. The researchers said the ability to generate expandable populations of progenitor cells with limited differentiation presents several advantages over the use of undifferentiated human stem cells: First, cultures derived from the latter often harbor undifferentiated cells that retain the potential to seed tumor growth. Second, development and manipulation of lineage-restricted progenitors is less elaborate. It s easier to create mature cell populations for research or therapeutic use. Third, because progenitor cells are limited in what kind of cell they can be, they are less likely than stem cells to differentiate into an unwanted cell type.  Our cells can serve as building blocks to generate kidneys that may one day be suitable for cell replacement and transplantation,  said Willert.  I think such a therapeutic application is still a few years in the future, but engineered kidney tissue can serve as a powerful model system to study how the human kidney interacts with and filters drugs. Such an application would be of tremendous value to the pharmaceutical industry.  Willert noted that the progenitor cells developed are likely capable of differentiating into other cell types of the intermediate mesodermal lineage as well, most notably the germ line to generate eggs and sperm in a dish.  We have only characterized their potential to differentiate into cells that contribute to the kidney. We are now investigating to what extent these cells can generate other tissues and organs that derive from intermediate mesoderm, including reproductive organs.  He said colleagues are also pursuing similar bioengineering-based approaches to generate other similar expandable progenitor cell populations capable of differentiation into mature cell types derived from other germ layers.","Published: November 12, 2015"

The genome contains all the information needed to build and maintain an organism, but it also holds the details of an individual s risk of developing common diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer , says study lead-author Arttu Jolma, doctoral student at the Department of Biosciences and Nutrition.  If we can improve our ability to read and understand the human genome, we will also be able to make better use of the rapidly accumulating genomic information on a large number of diseases for medical benefits.  The sequencing of the human genome in the year 2000 revealed how the 3 billion letters of A, C, G and T, that the human genome consists of, are ordered. However, knowing just the order of the letters is not sufficient for translating the genomic discoveries into medical benefits; one also needs to understand what the sequences of letters mean. In other words, it is necessary to identify the  words  and the  grammar  of the language of the genome. The cells in our body have almost identical genomes, but differ from each other because different genes are active (expressed) in different types of cells. Each gene has a regulatory region that contains the instructions controlling when and where the gene is expressed. This gene regulatory code is read by proteins called transcription factors that bind to specific  DNA words  and either increase or decrease the expression of the associated gene.   Compound words Under the supervision of Professor Jussi Taipale, researchers at Karolinska Institutet have previously identified most of the DNA words recognised by individual transcription factors. However, much like in a natural human language, the DNA words can be joined to form compound words that are read by multiple transcription factors. However, the mechanism by which such compound words are read has not previously been examined. Therefore, in their recent study in Nature, the Taipale team examines the binding preferences of pairs of transcription factors, and systematically maps the compound DNA words they bind to. Their analysis reveals that the grammar of the genetic code is much more complex than that of even the most complex human languages. Instead of simply joining two words together by deleting a space, the individual words that are joined together in compound DNA words are altered, leading to a large number of completely new words.  Our study identified many such words, increasing the understanding of how genes are regulated both in normal development and cancer , says Arttu Jolma.  The results pave the way for cracking the genetic code that controls the expression of genes. ","Published: November 12, 2015"

The system adopts an approach   tracking searches for key words and phrases such as  flu,   flu symptoms,   treating the flu    that has been tried before with varying levels of success, but combines it with additional data to improve accuracy. The result, according to Samuel Kou, a professor of statistics, is the most precise method yet.  If you see a spike in search volume, it probably indicates that something is going on,  Kou said. The history of tracking the flu using search data goes back several years. The most notable effort, Kou said, was that of Google Flu Trends, released in 2009 and discontinued last summer. Though Google Flu Trends used sophisticated algorithms and was revised repeatedly, its predictions often missed the retrospective analysis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks actual reports of people with flu-like symptoms seeking medical attention across the country. CDC data are considered something of a gold standard in disease surveillance, Kou said, but it takes one to three weeks for reports to be compiled, making it hard for public health officials to stay ahead of the flu. Though most sufferers recover relatively quickly, the disease can be deadly, killing 500,000 annually around the world. In the United States, it kills an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 people each year. Kou worked with Ph.D. student Shihao Yang and Mauricio Santillana, a lecturer in applied mathematics, to deliver results in real time. The approach, called ARGO, for AutoRegression with Google search data, combines Google data with historical records from the CDC and information on seasonality of the flu. It also accounts for changes in the inner workings of Google s search engine and shifts in search behavior. People learn as they search for information, Kou said, changing their queries and becoming better searchers.  If I want to search for something, I do it better now than I did two years ago. Besides, Google s search engine evolves, and so does the interaction between people and the engine,  Kou said. The project began about a year ago after a casual conversation on the topic between Kou and Santillana, who also has an appointment at Harvard-affiliated Boston Children s Hospital. The team is currently working to make ARGO open source and widely available.","Published: November 12, 2015"

""In nature, meters of DNA are packed tightly into every living cell,"" says Jessica Nash, a Ph.D. student at NC State and lead author of a paper on the work. ""This is possible because the DNA is wrapped tightly around a positively charged protein called a histone. We'd like to be able to shape DNA using a similar approach that replaces the histone with a charged gold nanoparticle. So we used computational techniques to determine exactly how different charges influence the curvature of nucleic acids - DNA and RNA."" In their model, the researchers manipulated the charge of the gold nanoparticles by adding or removing positively charged ligands - organic molecules attached to the surface of the nanoparticle. This allowed them to determine how the nucleic acid responded to each level of charge. An animation of a nanoparticle and ligands shaping a strand of DNA is available on the further information link below. ""This will let researchers know what to expect - how much charge they need in order to get the desired curvature in the nucleic acid,"" says Yaroslava Yingling, an associate professor of materials science and engineering at NC State and corresponding author of the paper. ""We used ligands in the model, but there are other ways to manipulate the charge of the nanoparticles,"" says Abhishek Singh, a postdoctoral researcher at NC State and co-author of the paper. ""For example, if the nanoparticles and nucleic acid are in solution, you can change the charge by changing the pH of the solution."" The work is also significant because it highlights how far computational research has come in materials science. ""Our large-scale models account for every atom involved in the process,"" says Nan Li, a Ph.D. student at NC State and co-author of the paper. ""This is an example of how we can use advanced computational hardware, such as the GPUs - or graphics processing units - developed for use in videogames, to conduct state-of-the-art scientific simulations."" The research team is now building on these findings to design new nanoparticles with different shapes and surface chemistries to get even more control over the shape and structure of nucleic acids.

Diseases like cancer can arise if they spiral out of control. In collaboration with doctors from Aachen University Hospital, scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Pl n have designed a mathematical model for mapping the development of populations of haematopoietic, i.e. blood-forming, stem cells with advancing age. The model uses the telomeres on the chromosomes of blood cells to do this. These protective covers, which are located at the ends of the chromosomes, shrink each time a cell divides. Thus, it is possible to tell how many times a cell has already divided from its length. Deviations from normal age-related length distribution could be indicative of disease. Stem cells are the origin of all specialised cells: when they divide, precursor cells are formed, which reproduce in turn and gradually differentiate into mature cells. During blood formation, for example, several billion different blood cells are formed every day from stem cells in the bone marrow. The number of stem cells increases in childhood, but is approximately constant in adulthood. In adults, cell division usually gives rise to a new stem cell and a precursor cell   the number thereby remains largely constant.Although haematopoietic stem cells are very long-lived, they are subject to ageing processes. As a result, they run the risk of gradually developing mutations in their genetic material. Mutated stem cells can thus arise which may grow uncontrollably and lead to the development of cancer. It is, however, difficult to establish the exact connection between the age and  division history  of stem cells, on the one hand, and their risk of malignant degeneration and the associated disease risks for patients. Benjamin Werner and Arne Traulsen from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Pl n therefore worked in cooperation with Fabian Beier and Tim Br mmendorf from Aachen University Hospital to calculate the development of the stem cells. With each cell division, the telomeres shrink slightly   until no further division is possible.  The length distribution of the telomeres therefore reflects the earlier divisions of a cell and we can draw conclusions about the stem cells, from which the finished cells were formed,  explains Werner.  Data were already available on average telomere lengths but not on their distribution. Previous models were not connected to this kind of data. We now made this step,  adds Traulsen. The scientists analyzed the blood cells of a total of 356 healthy test subjects of all ages and determined the distribution of the telomere lengths for 56 of them. Using these data, the team then tested different mathematical models in order to describe the length distribution for each age.  It turned out that the model that described the data  best was the one that also took the growth of the stem cell pool into account,  explains Werner. Stem cells can proliferate if, instead of dividing into one stem cell and one precursor cell, they divide into two daughter stem cells. Such symmetrical divisions are particularly common in children.  Thanks to the model, a snapshot of the current telomere length distribution is now in theory sufficient to find out about the past and future state of a person s telomeres. We can identify the stem cell population at any point in time,  says Traulsen. This enables the prediction of diseases and identification of risk groups. For example, there are indications that people with an optimal average number of stem cells are at the lowest risk of developing cancer.  On the other hand, much shortened telomeres can favour the emergence of certain diseases,  says Beier. The scientists now plan to examine these possible links using their model.  This could improve both diagnostics and prognostic assessment and, based on this, the targeted treatment of certain blood diseases in the future,  says Br mmendorf.","Published: November 12, 2015"

It is the first time that this phenomenon has been observed in the coronavirus family, which is responsible for one-third of common colds and is also suspected of being associated with the development or aggravation of neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and encephalitis. The discovery was achieved in the Laboratory of Neuroimmunovirology at INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier. In analyzing more than 60 human respiratory tract samples from patients infected by the human coronavirus, researchers discovered an important mutation in the S protein that modifies the virus capacity to infect nerve cells. The mutation is associated with the degree of viral virulence. ""We noticed that the protein mutation did not affect the virus's ability to infect the central nervous system, but that the mutated virus was less pathogenic and neurovirulent, probably as a result of changes in the way it spread from neuron to neuron due to the action of cellular proteins known as proprotein convertases, which alter the structure of the viral protein,"" explained lead researcher Professor Pierre Talbot. ""Under these conditions, the coronavirus could more easily cause a persistent central nervous system infection. In virology, this phenomenon is known to trigger certain slow-developing neurological conditions or aggravate neurological diseases"" These results make it possible to better understand how persistent coronavirus infections take hold and may help prevent the development of associated neurological diseases in humans.","Published: November 12, 2015"

This collaboration is part of Valneva s strategy to commercialize IXIARO  through a combination of its own sales & marketing infrastructure and distribution agreements with established local partners at favorable terms. VaxServe is a national healthcare supplier serving primary care physician offices, community immunization providers, immunizing pharmacies, travel clinics and corporations in the U.S. VaxServe is a subsidiary of Sanofi Pasteur, which is the vaccine division of Sanofi and a world leader in the vaccine industry. Under the terms of the agreements, VaxServe will perform marketing and promotional services and distribute Valneva s Japanese encephalitis vaccine exclusively in the U.S. private market beginning December 18, 2015. Through the agreements, Valneva and VaxServe are working together to increase the private market for IXIARO  vaccine in the U.S. The agreements do not include the distribution of the vaccine by VaxServe to the public market, including the U.S. military and other federal governmental agencies, which Valneva will handle directly. Over 5 million people travel annually from the U.S. to Asia1 where they are at risk of encountering the JE virus, a mosquito-born disease which is fatal in up to 30% of contracted cases. The number of U.S. travelers to Asia has been growing by over 5% between 2012 and 2014 according to the latest statistics published by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Thomas Lingelbach, President and CEO and Franck Grimaud, Deputy CEO of Valneva, commented,  This new marketing and distribution relationship is a significant step for Valneva, as IXIARO  is our largest revenue contributor. We believe that with VaxServe s market position and track record we have found the optimal partner to help us unlock the growth potential of this product in the U.S. travel segment.  Albert Thomas, Associate Vice President and General Manager of VaxServe, added,  VaxServe is pleased to partner with Valneva to market, sell and distribute this important travel vaccine to the U.S. private market. Further, through this distribution relationship, we ll have the opportunity to reinforce our position as a leader in the immunization services and solutions marketplace.  The agreements with VaxServe follow Valneva s decision in June 2015 to terminate the marketing and distribution agreement it had signed with Novartis vaccines in 2006 and which was transferred to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in 2015. Through this step Valneva expects to significantly improve sales margin and profitability of its JE vaccine, as of 2016 and beyond. Valneva is working with GSK on preparing the transition with the aim to ensure continuous supply and best service level to its customers.

A team at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust found that the test could detect mutations to the oestrogen receptor geneESR1   which conveys resistance to hormone treatment   specifically in women treated with aromatase inhibitors. Detecting mutations in this gene from cancer DNA in the bloodstream could allow doctors to rapidly identify which patients are no longer benefiting from treatment and switch them to an alternative drug. Researchers initially took blood samples from 171 women with ER-positive breast cancer, and then validated their results in three independent groups of patients. They found that ESR1 mutations could be detected by an ultra-sensitive method known as multiplexed digital PCR analysis, which can read the genetic code of tiny amounts of DNA released by tumours. This method proved able to detect DNA errors as sensitively as tumour biopsies, with 97 per cent matching between the two methods, and could in future remove the need for such an invasive procedure. Researchers at the ICR and The Royal Marsden found that once ESR1 mutations were detected, mutated cancer cells multiplied and became the dominant type in the body   driving the disease to become more aggressive and progress rapidly. Women who had breast cancers with ESR1 mutations were three times more likely to progress than those without.  The stage at which the cancer was treated had a huge influence over how cancers became resistant to aromatase inhibitors, which are used as standard after surgery in postmenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer. Mutations in ESR1 only occurred in 6 per cent of patients first treated with aromatase inhibitors when their cancers had not spread, but in 36 per of patients when the disease had already spread round the body by the time the drugs were administered. The research suggests more advanced cancers evolve drug resistance much more readily, reinforcing the importance of early diagnosis and early treatment for cancer. Study leader Dr Nicholas Turner, Team Leader in Molecular Oncology at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Consultant Medical Oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said:  Looking for cancer DNA in the blood allows us to analyse the genetic changes in cancer cells without the need for invasive biopsies. Our study demonstrates how these so-called liquid biopsies can be used to track the progress of treatment in the most common type of breast cancer.  The test could give doctors an early warning of treatment failure and, as clinical trials of drugs that target ESR1 mutations are developed, help select the most appropriate treatment for women with advanced cancer.  Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said:  We are in a new era of personalised cancer medicine, and liquid biopsies offer the hope that treatment can be monitored and adapted according to the evolution of an individual patient s cancer.  In the space of the last couple of years there has been astonishingly rapid progress in the development of liquid biopsies to detect specific cancer mutations in the bloodstream. I am excited by the prospects of these new tests and would like to see them assessed in clinical trials as soon as possible, so we can show that their use to adapt treatment can offer real benefits for cancer patients.

The test procedure was carried out using a portable suitcase laboratory. The mobile suitcase lab is operated with solar power and enables simple on-site diagnostics in remote areas without the need of an equipped laboratory. The new detection method, a recombinase polymerase amplification technique, shortly RPA, is based on the rapid identification of viral RNA in oral swabs of infected persons at 42 degrees. The comparison with two other currently available diagnostic methods revealed that the RPA is a very sensitive and rapid technique. An Ebola infection case was detected after 30 minutes.  In the field study, which took place in Guinea from March to May 2015, oral swabs samples from persons suspected of dying of Ebola virus were analyzed. The scientists compared the new RPA with two variants of a currently available detection method, the so-called real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). ""In the analysis we were able to determine two things"", says Ahmed Abd El Wahed, currently in the Department of Microbiology and Animal Hygiene at the University of G ttingen and a guest scientist at the German Primate Center. ""First, RPA works very well with oral swab samples, which greatly simplifies sampling in the future, because it is faster and less complicated than sampling blood. Second, we have demonstrated that RPA is as sensitive and specific as the gold standard, but technically much more simpler than the real-time PCR methods."" Nine hundred twenty eight oral swab samples were tested with RPA, one hundred twenty samples were positive and eight hundred eight negative. The reference real-time PCR method gave exactly the same results. ""That is a 100 per cent accuracy"", says Abd El Wahed. ""In addition, we observed during the test that RPA even works better than a currently commonly used WHO approved real-time PCR for the detection of Ebola."" Both the PCR and RPA-tests are based on the identification of viral RNA in the serum or oral swabs of infected persons. In contrast to the real-time PCR, the RPA reagent can be shipped, stored and used at ambient temperature of Africa (up to 38 degrees), which makes them cold chain independent. After 30 minutes, the detection of Ebola with RPA is possible. In contrast, the real-time PCR usually takes several hours. This complicates the use of the method in remote areas. ""In order to better control an Ebola epidemic, we must be able to prove infections on-site as early as possible"", says Abd El Wahed. In a previous project, Abd El Wahed, Manfred Weidmann and Frank Hufert of the former Department of Virology of the University Medical Center G ttingen (UMG) developed the laboratory suitcase. It now also contains all the necessary reagents and equipment needed for the Ebola virus detection by RPA and works up to 16 hours with solar power. A mobile glove box provides additional protection against infection with contaminated sample material. ""The mobile diagnostic kit facilitates detection of Ebola and other infectious diseases directly in the crisis areas"", says Ahmed Abd El Wahed. ""With the field study, we could now also demonstrate the effectiveness of the new tool. Speed, accuracy and ease of use are three important criteria that we were able to achieve with the new method. Thus, the procedure could contribute decisively to the management of future Ebola crises."" In future, the diagnostic kit is also to be used for the detection of other viral infections.

The Titan Krios is the most powerful high-resolution electron microscope for two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) characterization of protein structures and protein complexes.  The Titan Krios is an amazingly powerful tool for structural biology that is in huge demand by researchers right now,  said Dr. Neil Ranson, Associate Professor, School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds.  Currently, there are only two Titan Krios systems in the U.K., with a couple more on the way. There is an insatiable demand for time on microscopes with these capabilities, and access is very difficult to come by. We are very excited to be able to purchase two Titan Krios systems with direct electron detecting cameras; they will help to establish Leeds as one of the leading centers for cryo-TEM research in the U.K. and in the world.   Cryo-TEM is undergoing unprecedented growth because improvements in microscopes and detectors now enable close-to-atomic resolution structures for many biological systems,  said Professor Sheena Radford, Astbury Professor of Biophysics and Director of the Astbury Centre.  However the full potential of cryo-EM will come as a result of the synergy with other technologies, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR). The University of Leeds is also acquiring a new, state-of-the-art 950MHz NMR instrument dedicated to biological research in the Astbury Centre.  Peter Fruhstorfer, FEI s Vice President and General Manager of the Life Sciences business, stated,  We are delighted that the University of Leeds has selected the Titan Krios TEM, and we anticipate great results from the University s combined use of cryo-TEM, with XRD and NMR technology.  He adds,  The ability to purchase two systems is significant and will give the University the flexibility to conduct not only its own structural biology research, but also to build collaborations with researchers at other universities and institutions.  The two Krios systems were purchased as part of a  17M investment from the University s strategic reserves, an indication of the highest priority given to the acquisition by the University s leaders. The initiative is also supported by a  1M award from the Wellcome Trust to support biomedical discovery. The installation of the systems will begin in March 2016.

However, perception of non-food components of the dining experience can also influence flavor perception. For instance, desserts are rated as sweeter if they are presented on a white vs. black plate, and exposure to loud noise reduces affective food ratings. The latter result is particularly relevant to the bad reputation of airline food. Air cabins are unusual environments where food is routinely consumed under extreme noise conditions. In recent work published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, Yan and Dando examined the influence of the extreme noise conditions encountered during flight on the five basic tastes. Participants rated sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami solutions on a scale from 'barely detectable' to 'strongest imaginable'. Each basic taste was tested with three concentration levels. Solutions were evaluated in two sessions, one with simulated air cabin noise (broad spectrum, peak ~290 Hz, delivered at 80-85 dB), and one with normal ambient room noise. Noise was delivered for 30 minutes prior to testing while participants read or studied, and continued to play during testing. Noise condition had no influence on intensity ratings for salty, bitter, and sour tastes. However, taste intensity was suppressed for sweet solutions at all concentration levels, and enhanced for umami solutions at higher concentrations, in the air cabin noise condition. Effects of air cabin noise were specific to sweet and umami taste perception: there were no differences in tactile, color saturation, or sound intensity (of a tone) ratings between conditions. Moreover, there were no differences in performance on a simple reaction time test, ruling out differences in task focus or attentiveness between conditions. These results suggest that enjoyment of airline food may be rated consistently lower than would be expected because the loud ambient noise dampens perception of pleasurable sweet flavors. However, the results also suggest that this could be ameliorated by focusing on the sought-after taste quality of umami, which was not just immune to the effects of loud noise, but enhanced by it. A relationship between audition and taste is not surprising: bilateral branches of the facial nerve that innervate taste buds cross the tympanic membrane of the ear on their way to the brain. But why were only two of the five basic tastes affected by noise? Unlike the other basic tastes, sweet and umami share a common taste receptor. Moreover, this particular taste receptor is associated with prevalent genetic mutations, leading the authors to speculate that genetic factors may modulate the magnitude of the effects observed here. Indeed, inspection of individual data suggested two distinct groups: those who showed robust modulation of both sweet and umami as a function of noise level, and those who were virtually unaffected for either taste.

In a review published in the Journal of Parkinson's Disease, the literature concerning alcohol consumption presents conflicting information. A systematic review of the relevant literature from 2000-2014, from observational studies, found little evidence for either a positive or negative effect on PD risk from alcohol consumption. When weak associations were observed in some reports, the authors found that the studies were at greater risk of selection and recall bias, which could compromise the effects found. Sixteen articles that met the criteria for inclusion were identified. All were primary research articles, published in English in peer-reviewed journals. These studies had to include a comparison or control group consisting of individuals without PD, report a measure of association between quantity and frequency of alcohol intake and PD risk, and adjust at least for the potential confounding factors of smoking and age. Research that measured alcohol exposure only as drinker versus non-drinker were excluded. ""This review determined several possible methodological weaknesses that could explain the varying and often conflicting results of studies reporting lifestyle exposures such as smoking, coffee/tea and alcohol consumption contributing to PD risk,"" explained lead investigator Silvana Bettiol, PhD, MPH, School of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Tasmania, Australia. ""These included selection or self-selection of controls, difficulties in retrospective assessment of alcohol consumption, differences in the lengths of follow-up periods, and inconsistent definitions of drinkers and non-drinkers."" In addition, in studies in which alcohol consumption and PD incidence were accurately measured over time, only non-significant associations were found, further supporting the argument that various limitations and biases affected many of the studies. ""This study highlights the need for more prospective studies investigating the relationship between alcohol and PD of adequate sample size. Improvements to reporting of studies by investigators particularly with respect to sample size and power would help others interpret the epidemiological significance of any findings,"" concluded Bettiol.

The researchers, at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said the implants one day may be used in different parts of the body to fight pain that doesn't respond to other therapies. ""Our eventual goal is to use this technology to treat pain in very specific locations by providing a kind of 'switch' to turn off the pain signals long before they reach the brain,"" said co-senior investigator Robert W. Gereau IV, PhD, the Dr. Seymour and Rose T. Brown Professor of Anesthesiology and director of the Washington University Pain Center. The study is published in the journal Nature Biotechnology. Because the devices are soft and stretchable, they can be implanted into parts of the body that move, Gereau explained. The devices previously developed by the scientists had to be anchored to bone. ""But when we're studying neurons in the spinal cord or in other areas outside of the central nervous system, we need stretchable implants that don't require anchoring,"" he said. The new devices are held in place with sutures. Like the previous models, they contain microLED lights that can activate specific nerve cells. Gereau said he hopes to use the implants to blunt pain signals in patients who have pain that cannot be managed with standard therapies. The researchers experimented with mice that were genetically engineered to have light-sensitive proteins on some of their nerve cells. To demonstrate that the implants could influence the pain pathway in nerve cells, the researchers activated a pain response with light. When the mice walked through a specific area in a maze, the implanted devices lit up and caused the mice to feel discomfort. Upon leaving that part of the maze, the devices turned off, and the discomfort dissipated. As a result, the animals quickly learned to avoid that part of the maze. The experiment would have been very difficult with older optogenetic devices, which are tethered to a power source and can inhibit the movement of the mice. Because the new, smaller, devices are flexible and can be held in place with sutures, they also may have potential uses in or around the bladder, stomach, intestines, heart or other organs, according to co-principal investigator John A. Rogers, PhD, professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois. ""They provide unique, biocompatible platforms for wireless delivery of light to virtually any targeted organ in the body,"" he said. Rogers and Gereau designed the implants with an eye toward manufacturing processes that would allow for mass production so the devices could be available to other researchers. Gereau, Rogers and Michael R. Bruchas, PhD, associate professor of anesthesiology at Washington University, have launched a company called NeuroLux to aid in that goal.

Exline, PhD, from USC and Jianbin Wang, PhD, from Sangamo BioSciences describe a new, more efficient way to edit genes in blood-forming or ""hematopoietic"" stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). ""Gene therapy using HSPCs has enormous potential for treating HIV and other diseases of the blood and immune systems,"" said co-corresponding author Paula Cannon, PhD, professor of molecular microbiology and immunology, pediatrics, biochemistry and molecular biology, and stem cell biology and regenerative medicine at USC. ""And using genome editing techniques now allows us to make very precise changes that could repair genetic mutations -- the gene typos -- that can cause disease."" Despite the enormous potential of such targeted gene medicine to cure patients, getting genome editing to work has proven challenging in human HSPCs -- especially in the most primitive, least differentiated cells with the greatest ability to become any blood cell type. Cannon's group, working with a team at Sangamo, has been using ""genetic scissors"" called zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) to cut a cell's DNA at a precise location or sequence. The cell normally uses a copy of the cut DNA sequence as a template to repair the DNA break. During this process, there is the opportunity to introduce new DNA sequences or to repair mutations, effectively fooling the cell into making a genetic edit. To provide the cell with both the targeted nuclease and the new DNA template, scientists can use a variety of delivery vehicles or vectors, including viruses and a type of genetic material known as messenger RNA (mRNA). In the study, the team discovered a highly effective way to deliver the DNA repair template using a specific type of viral vector, known as an adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 6, which can naturally enter HSPCs. At the same time, they found that delivering the ZFNs as short-lived mRNA molecules allowed the DNA cutting and repair process to occur without disrupting the HSPCs. By combining these two delivery methods, the scientists were able to insert a gene at a precise site in even the most primitive human HSPCs with unprecedented efficiency rates ranging from 15 to 40 percent. The team then transplanted these genetically edited human HSPCs into immune-deficient mice, and found that the cells thrived and differentiated into many different blood cell types -- all retaining the edits to their DNA. ""Our results provide a strategy for broadening the application of genome editing technologies in HSPCs,"" said co-corresponding author Michael C.

The discovery, in mice, lays the groundwork for a single vaccine or antibody-based treatment against many different alphaviruses.  There is a lot of emphasis on identifying and understanding broadly neutralizing antibodies for other viruses   HIV, hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, influenza virus   but most of those antibodies neutralize different strains of the same virus,  said senior author Michael Diamond, MD, PhD, a professor of medicine and director of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccine Development in the Center for Human Immunology and Immunotherapy Programs.  What we ve identified here are antibodies that actually neutralize several different alphaviruses.  The viruses Diamond and colleagues studied are arthritogenic alphaviruses, so-named for their characteristic symptoms of fever followed by arthritis-like joint pain. These mosquito-borne viruses typically cause only sporadic outbreaks, although Chikungunya has been identified in Africa, Asia, Europe, South America and even the southern United States. In recent years, the virus has caused millions of infections annually across the globe. So far in 2015, 650 cases have been seen in U.S. residents, largely among travelers returning from the Caribbean, where they were infected. There is no vaccine or treatment for Chikungunya or other alphaviruses. As part of the study, Diamond and his colleagues screened 60 neutralizing mouse and human antibodies against Chikungunya and determined that 10 react against three or more different alphaviruses that cause arthritis-like symptoms. They also identified a small piece of the alphavirus called an epitope that is identical across the arthritogenic alphavirus family. In follow-up work in cell cultures, they showed that antibodies that recognize this epitope also protect against infection by multiple alphaviruses. The antibodies blocked multiple steps in the viral life cycle, including the virus s ability to enter or exit host cells. To confirm that the antibodies could protect animals from disease, the researchers infected mice with three different alphaviruses: Chikungunya, the closely related O nyong nyong virus, or the more distantly related Mayaro virus. The mice then were treated with the each of two of the most potent broadly neutralizing antibodies, and both antibodies markedly reduced joint disease caused by any of the viruses. The researchers then identified a section of an alphavirus protein as the key binding site for the cross-protective antibodies. When such an antibody binds to this site, it changes the three-dimensional structure of the proteins on the surface of the virus, thus providing an explanation for how these antibodies prevent viral infection.  If you can make an antibody response against this region, you may be able to protect against many viruses in the family,  said Diamond.  Our group is making proteins now that focus on this epitope, and we re planning to start immunizing animals soon to see if we generate the right kinds of antibodies.  People who are infected with alphaviruses produce antibodies against many viral epitopes, some of which are not protective. This could lead to a weak immune response that gives the virus time to multiply and cause disease. People who are immunized with proteins expressing the key epitope identified by the researchers, however, should be able to quickly produce the  right  protective antibodies, thereby short-circuiting the disease process.  We have more work to do but are encouraged that targeting this epitope could be a viable strategy for developing vaccines or treatments against Chikungunya and other related viruses that cause significant disease worldwide,  Diamond said.","Published: November 11, 2015"

In this study researchers from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid/IMDEA-Nanociencia, the Instituto de Investigaci n Sanitaria Hospital 12 de Octubre (Madrid), and the Instituto de Investigaciones Qu micas del CSIC-Universidad de Sevilla have collaborated, together with three european research groups (CNRS/Universit  de Strasbourg, France and Universit  de Namur, Belgium). ""Fullerenes are hollow cages exclusively formed by carbon atoms"", explains Nazario Mart n, Professor of Organic Chemistry in the UCM and main author of the study. In this work, scientists have employed C60 fullerene, which is formed by 60 carbon atoms and has the shape of a truncated icosahedron, which resembles a football ball.These molecules decorated with specific carbohydrates (sugars) present affinity by the receptor used as an entry point to infect the cell and act blocking it, thus inhibiting the infection. Researchers employed an artificial ebola virus by expressing one of its proteins, envelope protein GP1, responsible of its entry in the cells. In a model in vitro, this protein is covering a false virus, which is able of cell infection but not of replication. ""We have employed a cell model previously described in our lab which consists in a cell line of human lymphocytes expressing DC-SIGN receptor, which facilitates the entry of the virus in Dendritic Cells"", points out Rafael Delgado, researcher of the Hospital 12 de Octubre, and other of the authors of the study. By blocking this receptor and inhibiting the virus infection, the authors think that the dissemination of the virus would decrease and the immune response increase, but this idea has still to be developed with in vivo studies. The biggest fullerene system in the lab The system designed by the chemists, based on carbon nanostructures developed in the UCM, mimic the presentation of carbohydrates surrounding virus like ebola or VIH. The team has achieved an unprecedented success in fullerene chemistry and dendritic growth: connecting in one synthetic step twelve fullerene units, each with ten sugars, to other central fullerene, creating a globular superstructure with 120 sugar moieties on its surface, ""this is the fastest dendrimeric growth developed in a laboratory up to now"" says Beatriz Illescas, Professor in the UCM and coauthor of the work. According to scientists, the results highlight the potential of these giant molecules as antiviral agents. ""This work open the door to the design and preparation of new systems to inhibit the pathogens infection in cases where the current therapies are not effective or are inexistent, as occurs with the ebola virus"", clarifies Mart n. After these experiments on the cellular level, researchers will study the behavior of these systems in animal models, starting with mice. ""We will study, on the one hand, the pharmacokinetics and, on the other, the antiviral activity in vivo"" explains Javier Rojo, researcher of the Instituto de Investigaciones Qu micas del CSIC and other of the authors of the study.

Researchers from the University of Chicago and the Beijing Institute of Genomics estimate that the tumor, about 3.5 centimeters in diameter, contained more than 100 million distinct mutations within the coding regions of its genes -- thousands of times more than expected. The finding suggests that even microscopic tumors are likely to contain extremely high genetic diversity. With so much variation, even small tumors are likely to contain cells that may be able to resist standard post-surgical cancer treatment such as chemotherapy and radiation. ""With 100 million mutations, each capable of altering a protein in some way, there is a high probability that a significant minority of tumor cells will survive, even after aggressive treatment,"" said study director Chung-I Wu, PhD, professor of ecology and evolution at the University of Chicago. ""In a setting with so much diversity, those cells could multiply to form new tumors, which would be resistant to standard treatments."" The high level of genetic variation also adds fuel to a long-running debate in evolutionary biology: Is evolution, at the DNA level, driven by selective Darwinian forces -- the survival of the fittest? Or is there a role for random, or neutral, non-Darwinian changes -- the persistence of the luckiest? For this study, the researchers closely examined an ordinary tumor removed from a human liver. This hepatocellular carcinoma was slightly smaller than a ping-pong ball and contained more than a billion cells. Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Genomics rigorously sampled nearly 300 regions from one slice of the tumor and sequenced or genotyped each one looking for genetic changes. When they analyzed their data, using modern population genetic theory, they came up with estimates for the whole tumor of more than 100 million coding-region mutations. That is far more mutations than one would expect, ""by orders of magnitude,"" Wu said. Such rapid and extensive generation of enormous diversity, way beyond what a Darwinian process would permit, makes the selectionism vs. neutralism debate of the 1980s ""suddenly medically relevant,"" according to Wu. Until now, no one had probed a tumor so thoroughly. The prevailing notion was that tumors had from a few hundred up to 20,000 genetic alterations that were not present in the patientembers healthy cells. ""Our study is the non-Darwinian process writ small, down to the cellular level,"" Wu said. ""In the Darwinian struggle, there are -- from the tumor's point of view -- few beneficial mutations, meaning changes that give tumor cells a growth advantage."" Over time, such good mutations would be expected to drive out the deleterious ones. That limits diversity. ""When there are no such limits on genetic variation, however, mutations can emerge and apparently thrive,"" he said. ""This could potentially change how we think about tumor growth and spread, but the direct clinical implications of this study may not be obvious on the surface,"" said co-author medical oncologist Daniel Catenacci, MD, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago. The bulk of the mutations were in very low frequencies; 99 percent were found in fewer than 100 cells. Cells carrying these rare mutations were often in clumps. They were ""competing mostly with themselves,"" according to the authors. But drug treatment could remove those constraints. ""It 'looses up' the population,"" the authors wrote, enabling ""effective competition to occur."" ""The presence of so many random mutations could present a problem to specifically targeted therapies,"" Catenacci said. ""It almost guarantees that some cells will be resistant. But it also suggests that aggressive treatment could push tumor cells into a more Darwinian mode."" The study focused on just one exhaustively sampled tumor, but it raises important questions. Previous studies have found that patient survival decreases as genetic diversity within tumors increases. More mutations make drug resistance more likely. ""The possibility of high intra-tumor diversity even in small tumors suggests a need to reevaluate treatment strategies,"" the authors conclude.","Published: November 11, 2015"

The initiative aims to accelerate research into biology s  invisible mass  to provide novel insights into cell function and a new frontier in drug discovery. The term  dark proteome  describes the large portion of the proteome the complete collection of proteins in an organism that do not adopt defined 3D structures. These little-studied proteins make up about one third of the human proteome and control many aspects of cellular behavior. Recent developments in technology, including advances in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy methods, now make it possible to look in detail at these  intrinsically disordered proteins  (IDPs) and the  intrinsically disordered regions  (IDRs) of these molecules.  Our goal is to raise awareness about the potential societal impacts of a broad-based research infrastructure for these understudied proteins,  saidRichard Kriwacki, Ph.D., a member of the St. Jude Department of Structural Biology and of the HDPI.  We also want to develop educational programs that will address the origins and potential cures of devastating diseases affected by these proteins that afflict large numbers of patients across the world.   IDPs are involved in heart disease, infectious disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson s disease and Alzheimer s disease,  said Peter Wright, Ph.D., who is Cecil H. and Ida M. Green Investigator at TSRI and chair of the HDPI.  We need to advance our understanding of the functions and molecular mechanisms of these proteins so we can work toward better therapies for these debilitating diseases.  Wright and Kriwacki emphasized that dramatically expanded investment in basic and translational research into the dark proteome is needed to achieve the full potential for understanding and developing cures for many devastating diseases.","Published: November 11, 2015"

This starved state is typical in some of today's most common diseases, particularly heart attack, stroke, and cancer. The findings provide new insight into the damage these diseases cause and may help researchers to discover new ways of treating them. When a person has a heart attack or a stroke, the blood supply to part of their heart or brain is blocked. This deprives affected cells there of oxygen and nutrients, a condition known as ischaemia, and can cause long-term damage, meaning that the person may never fully recover. Ina Kirmes, a PhD student in the group of Dr. George Reid at IMB, investigated what happens to the DNA in cells that are cut off from their oxygen and nutrient supply.In a healthy cell, large parts of the DNA are open and accessible. This means that genes can be easily read and translated into proteins, so that the cell can function normally. However, the researchers showed that, in ischaemia, DNA changes dramatically: it compacts into tight clusters. The genes in this clumped DNA cannot be read as easily anymore by the cell, their activity is substantially reduced, and the cell effectively shuts down. If cells in a person's heart stop working properly, this part of the heart stops beating and they will have a heart attack. Similarly, when blood supply is blocked to cells in someone's brain and their cells there are starved of oxygen and nutrients, they have a stroke. Dr. George Reid is excited about the implications of this finding. ""When you have a stroke, when you have a heart attack, this is likely to be what's happening to your DNA,"" he explained. ""Now we know that this is what's going on, we can start to look at ways of preventing this compaction of DNA."" The key to this discovery was a close collaboration with Aleksander Szczurek, joint first author on this publication, who is part of the group of Professor Christoph Cremer at IMB. They developed a new method that made it possible to see DNA inside the cell at a level of detail never achieved before. Their technique is a further development of super-resolution light microscopy, which uses blinking dyes that bind to DNA to enable the researchers to define the location of individual molecules in cells.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men worldwide, with over 1.2 million diagnosed in 2012. In number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer increases and within 20 years over 2 million men are estimated to be diagnosed yearly. Currently, PSA is used to diagnose prostate cancer, but the procedure has long been controversial.  PSA can t distinguish between aggressive and benign cancer,  says principal investigator Henrik Gr nberg, MD, PhD, Professor of Cancer Epidemiology at Karolinska Institutet.  Today, men who don t have cancer or who have a form of cancer that doesn t need treating must go through an unnecessary, painful and sometimes dangerous course of treatment. On top of this, PSA misses many aggressive cancers. We therefore decided to develop a more precise test that could potentially replace PSA.  The new so-called STHLM3 test is a blood test that analyzes a combination of six protein markers, over 200 genetic markers and clinical data (age, family history and previous prostate biopsies). The test has been developed by researchers at Karolinska Institutet in collaboration with Thermo Fisher Scientific, which provided the protein and genetic marker assays used in the clinical study. Reduced the number of biopsies The study included 58,818 men from Stockholm aged 50 to 69 and was conducted between 2012 and 2014. The STHLM3 test and PSA were performed on all participants and then compared. The results show that the STHLM3 test reduced the number of biopsies by 30 percent without compromising patient safety. In addition, the STHLM3 test found aggressive cancers in men with low PSA values (1-3 ng/ml)   cancers that are currently going undetected.  This is indeed promising results. If we can introduce a more accurate way of testing for prostate cancer, we ll spare patients unnecessary suffering and save resources for society , says Professor Gr nberg.  The STHLM3 tests will be available in Sweden in March 2016 and we will now start validating it in other countries and ethnic groups . The study was financed by the Stockholm County Council.

According to the World Health Organisation, around 35 million people were living with HIV at the end of 2013. Over two million people are newly infected every year, and it is estimated that around $22 billion ( 14.3 billion) is spent yearly on HIV treatment and care. An effective vaccine remains the best hope of ending the epidemic. Although researchers have been working on developing a vaccine for 30 years, recent advances are helping to speed up their quest. Scientists have isolated antibodies that are able to block HIV infection in preclinical models, and there have been new developments in using synthetic biology to design better vaccines.  Oxford University professors Tom  Hanke and Quentin Sattentau are key members of the EAVI2020 consortium, which unites scientists from 22 institutions, pooling their knowledge and expertise to develop novel candidate vaccines that can be taken through to human trials within five years. EAVI2020 is funded with as part the health program of the EU's Horizon 2020 programme for research and innovation. Professor Robin Shattock, Coordinator of EAVI2020, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, said: 'Creating an effective vaccine against HIV represents one of the greatest biological challenges of a generation. But it is impossible for one group or institution to create an HIV vaccine on its own. This new project should enable us to move much more quickly. It brings together a multidisciplinary team of molecular biologists, immunologists, virologists, biotechnologists and clinicians, providing the breadth of expertise needed to take the latest discoveries in the lab and rapidly advance them through preclinical testing and manufacture, into early human trials.' At Oxford, researchers will be looking at raising two specific types of immunity to HIV infection   T cells and antibodies. If successful, both the T cell and antibody strategies could offer a universal HIV vaccine for use worldwide. Professor Tom  Hanke will lead a team to test a novel vaccine strategy focusing effector T cells, which respond to infection, on the most  functionally conserved  regions of HIV proteins. These are areas of protein, which remain the same even as variants of the virus evolve around the world and are therefore likely to be critical for HIV's basic survival.  He said:  Conserved T-cell vaccines would complement antibody vaccines to provide optimal prevention, and provide a key tool for HIV cure.  Professor Quentin Sattentau s laboratory will be designing and testing novel types of protein vaccines based on the HIV envelope glycoprotein, the target of protective antibody responses. He said:  We aim to engineer proteins that trigger the immune system to make antibodies that recognise and inactivate most or all viral species circulating in the global pandemic, so that vaccinated individuals will be broadly protected from infection.  Dr Ruxandra Draghia-Akli, Director of the Health Directorate at the Directorate General for Research and Innovation of the European Commission said: 'In its dual role of policy maker and research funder, the European Commission has played an essential part for over thirty years in supporting HIV vaccine research. Despite major global investments in the field and the promising progress, several scientific obstacles have to be overcome to develop novel promising HIV vaccine candidates. It is with this in mind that the European Commission is providing an almost 23 million Euro grant to the EAVI2020 consortium from which we have high hopes for success. This will allow European scientists to work together and in collaboration with researchers from outside Europe to successfully develop predictive tools and better vaccine candidates to be tested at an early stage of the process.'","Published: November 11, 2015"

The remaining bacterial population was 1/10,000th of its original size. The researchers also tested the method on pig tissue, where it killed most of the bacteria and did not damage surrounding tissue. Researchers have tried treating infected wounds with electrical stimulation for more than a century but with mixed results. For obvious reasons, antibiotics have been the preferred and most effective treatment for infections, but their widespread use has led to drug-resistant strains. In the U.S. at least two million infections and 23,000 deaths are attributable to antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Electrical stimulation has had mixed results against bacteria, but this is probably due in part because people didn t have a clear understanding of how it works electrochemically, said Haluk Beyenal, co-author of the paper and a professor in WSU s Gene and Linda Voiland School of Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering. The WSU researchers for the first time demonstrated the electrochemical reaction produces hydrogen peroxide, an effective disinfectant, at the electrode surface.  We have been doing fundamental research on this for many years, and finally, we are able to transfer it to technology,  said Beyenal.  It s really exciting.  The researchers optimized the reaction and developed an  e-scaffold,  a sort of electronic Band-Aid made out of conductive carbon fabric. By running electrical current through the fabric, they produced a low and constant concentration of hydrogen peroxide to kill the bugs.  The bacteria are unable to develop resistance to such an electrochemical treatment.  Many people tried this simple method,  said Beyenal.  Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn t. We controlled the electrochemical reactions. That s the reason it works.  The researchers have applied for a patent and are now working to increase the e-scaffold s effectiveness and test it with a variety of bacterial species.","Published: November 11, 2015"

Molecular receptors on each cell receive these chemical signals and allow cells to accomplish a task important for health. Astonishingly, for about half of these receptors, the chemical signals remain unknown. These  orphan receptors  are highly expressed in particular tissues but their functions remain a mystery. They are considered  dark  elements of the genome, and yet they hold great potential for drug development for a variety of diseases and conditions. Now, scientists at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine (UNC) and University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) have created a general tool to probe the activity of these orphan receptors, illuminating their roles in behavior and making them accessible for drug discovery. The creation of the research tool   involves computer modeling, yeast- and mammalian cell-based molecular screening techniques, and mouse models.  This work will help researchers learn how orphan receptors interact with molecules inside the body or with drugs. Specifically, the UNC and UCSF scientists used their new tool to find a novel probe molecule that can modulate the orphan G protein-coupled receptor 68 (GPR68, also known as OGR1), an orphan receptor that is highly expressed in the brain.   GPCRs are the single most important family of therapeutic drug targets,  said Brian Shoichet, PhD, professor of pharmaceutical chemistry at UCSF.  About 27 percent of FDA-approved drugs act through GPCRs. They are considered to be among the most useful targets for discovering new medications.  The new probe molecule, dubbed  ogerin,  turns on GPR68, activating its signaling role. To understand how this activation of GPR68 affects brain function, the investigators gave it to mice and put them through a battery of behavioral tests. Mice that had been given ogerin were much less likely to learn to fear a specific stimulus. This  fear-conditioning  is controlled by the hippocampus, where GPR68 is highly expressed. But ogerin had no effect on mice that lacked this receptor.  To demonstrate general research applicability, the UNC and UCSF researchers also used their technique to find molecules that can modulate GPR65, another orphan receptor.  We provide an integrated approach that we believe can be applied to many other receptors,  said Bryan L. Roth, MD, PhD, co-senior author of theNature paper and the Michael Hooker Distinguished Professor of Protein Therapeutics and Translational Proteomics in the Department of Pharmacology at UNC.  The goal is to quickly find drug-like compounds for these receptors. This should facilitate discovery of novel and safer therapeutics for a host of diseases.  Xi-Ping Huang, PhD, co-first author and research assistant professor at UNC, said,  We used yeast-based screening techniques to find compounds that activate an orphan receptor. Then [co-first author] Joel Karpiak, a graduate student in Shoichet s lab at UCSF, created a computer model and searched libraries of millions of compounds to find out what kind of molecular structure ensures proper binding and interaction with a specific receptor. Then, back in the lab, we tested new molecules and found a novel ligand.  A ligand is a chemical that binds to a specific part of a protein, such as a receptor.  The fact that GPR68 is highly expressed in several tissues, especially the brain, and that it is a member of the large GPCR family, suggests that this discovery can be further leveraged for drug discovery,  Shoichet said. Currently, few drug developers would seek drugs for a target with an unknown role in human biology. With new evidence of the role of GPR68   and a molecule that can modulate that role   the door has been opened for further research studies, both basic and applied.   The druggable genome is an iceberg that is mostly submerged,  Shoichet said.  This paper illuminates a small piece of it, providing new reagents to modulate a previously dark, unreachable drug target. Just as important, the strategy should be useful to many other dark targets in the genome.  Roth s lab is well known for developing technologies to probe biological function. His team developed DREADDS (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs), for which he was given an NIH BRAIN Initiative grant. First results on work from that grant were reported earlier this year with the development of a second kind of DREADD. For the Nature paper, Roth s lab teamed up with Shoichet lab, which developed the computational method to screen more than 3.1 million molecules for potential activity on GPR68. The goal was to predict those very few molecules that could modulate the receptor. This eventually led them to the molecule ogerin. The same approach also helped the team discover compounds that activated or modulated GPR65, suggesting that the approach could help scientists discover ligands for other understudied and orphan G protein-coupled receptors.  Orphan receptors could be a great source of therapeutics,  Huang said.  But it has been difficult to study them. The research community has needed an approach that works, and that s why we put so much effort into this. ","Published: November 11, 2015"

The study, conducted by marine scientists at Plymouth University, has found that a number of notorious  nuisance  species   such as Japanese kelp (Undaria pinnatifida) and stinging jellyfish (Pelagia noctiluca) are resilient to rising CO2 levels. They show why global warming and changes in seawater chemistry can help the spread of hundreds of damaging marine organisms. The study notes that in the tropics, coral reefs face a host of interconnected problems (bleaching, corrosion, disease, spreading seaweed, invasive species) that are all caused by rising CO2 levels.  We are witnessing the spread of marine life that cause problems   such as toxic jellyfish blooms and rotting algal mats,  said Professor Jason Hall-Spencer, lead author of the report.  Based on a synthesis of evidence available to date, we predict the problems associated with harmful marine life will get worse in response to rising CO2. Pathogens like cholera don t recognise national borders so seawater warming is a health issue for cities like London, and nobody knows what organisms will spread and cause problems as Arctic shipping routes open up.  The study arose from observations at volcanic sites in the Mediterranean, where Professor Hall-Spencer has led expeditions to record what forms of marine life cope well with higher CO2 levels. They found that invasive species of algae and jellyfish thrive at levels of carbon dioxide predicted to occur this decade. Their extensive review of laboratory experiments reveals stand-out cases such as so called  Killer algae  (Caulerpa taxifolia), which is spreading world-wide, that benefit from higher CO2 but are so toxic that native herbivores die of starvation rather than eat it.  The report highlights the American slipper limpet, Crepidula fornicate, as an example of ocean acidification both helping and hindering a species, with evidence to show it has spread to Europe to become one of the 100 most invasive species, while at the same time, the species  larvae has been placed at greater risk of predation due to reduced shell growth. Similarly, both the Red King Crab, which has invaded the Barents Sea, and the predatory snail Urosalpinx cinera, which has moved from the north west Atlantic to the north east Atlantic and Pacific, impacting upon oyster and scallop aquaculture in the process, have also demonstrated a marked reduction in larval survival and growth.   Observations show there will be winners as well as losers as CO2 levels ramp up, just as there were in previous mass extinctions,  said researcher Ro Allen.  The spread of harmful marine organisms should be factored into risks of rising CO2 emissions. ","Published: November 11, 2015"

Patients with both PD and GD tend to experience earlier onset of PD and more serious cognitive changes than PD patients without the mutations. A new study published in the Journal of Parkinson s Disease suggests that GD or the presence of GBA mutations may actually shield patients from deficiency in visual color discrimination, which is a hallmark of PD.  Consistent with previous studies, color discrimination was decreased in patients with PD. However, this study introduces new findings that relate to the impact of GD in the context of PD-related color discrimination. These findings may imply a  protective effect  on color discrimination in those GD patients who also have PD, which probably is due to a sensory mechanism rather than a cognitive effect,  explained lead investigator Deborah Elstein, PhD, of the Gaucher Clinic at Shaare Zedek Medical Center Jerusalem (Israel), which is the largest clinic of its kind, devoted solely to Gaucher disease patients. This group, spearheaded by Prof. Ari Zimran, the Director of the Gaucher Clinic, was the first to publish anecdotal evidence of the association between GD and early-onset PD. The investigators tested groups of patients on a color visual discrimination test known as the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test (FMHT) and calculated their mean Total Error Scores (TES). In the FMHT, patients are asked to arrange colored caps so that there is a gradual transition in color between two anchor caps of different colors. Better performance is indicated by lower TES scores. The groups consisted of 10 patients each, classified by PD only, GD only, both PD and GD, carriers of the GBA mutations, GBA carriers with PD or healthy controls. GBA carriers were thought to have one mutation whereas those with GD have two mutations. Looking at the mean number of errors on the FMHT, the GD only group made the least number of errors (mean 129.70), fewer errors than even the healthy controls (mean 177.70). The PD only group made the most number of errors (mean 289.70), more than twice the number made by those with GD only, confirming that PD patients manifest poor color discrimination. Patients with both GD and PD made the second highest number of errors (mean 237.90), followed by those who were GBA carriers with PD (220.20). GBA carriers without PD made more errors (177.20) than those with GD only, which was approximately the same number of errors as healthy controls. Overall, patients with PD displayed worse visual color discrimination compared to those without PD.  The seminal finding of lowest TES (fewest errors) among patients with GD only (also relative to the healthy persons) was unexpected,  stated Dr. Elstein. She also noted with interest that patients with GD (with or without PD) had lower TES than GBA carriers (with or without PD). These findings strengthen the evidence linking PD and GD. For instance, a small proportion of patients with GD, and an even higher proportion of their relatives who are carriers of GD, display symptoms of parkinsonism. Other studies have found that having one or two mutations of the GBA gene is a risk factor for PD, while PD patients have a greater than anticipated frequency of GBA mutations. GBA-associated PD is characterized by an early onset accompanied by severe cognitive impairment, and  generally these patients suffer more often and more severely from a variety of non-motor symptoms such as neuropsychiatric complaints and autonomic impairment,  commented Dr. Elstein. Gaucher disease is the most common genetic disease affecting Ashkenazi Jewish people who originated primarily from Eastern Europe.

If the finding, discovered in rats, is confirmed in humans, it may lead to new insights into hyperacusis, an increased sensitivity to loud noises that can lead to severe and long-lasting ear pain.  We are still a long way from being able to treat hyperacusis,  says Paul Fuchs, PhD, professor of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, neuroscience and biomedical engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine,  but our results suggest that cells called type II afferent neurons are similar to pain-sensing neurons in the rest of the body, so lessons about interventions elsewhere could apply to the ear, too.  The new discovery came as a result of interest in why this small subset of afferent nerve cells nerves that take information from the inner ear to the brain are quite insensitive to sound.  If they aren t very good at relaying sounds, what are they doing?  says Fuchs. Fuchs and his team knew that these type II afferents connect to specialized sensory cells in the ear of mammals. These so-called outer hair cells amplify the sound waves that enter the inner ear, giving mammals very sensitive hearing over a wide range of frequencies. But, according to Fuchs, this specialization comes at a cost.  Outer hair cells are the canaries in the coal mine for the inner ear, in that they re the first cells to die due to loud noise, age or other factors,  says Fuchs.  Since they can t regenerate, their death leads to permanent hearing loss.  So one possible role for type II afferents, he adds, would be to warn the brain of impending damage to outer hair cells. It was known that nearby supporting cells respond to outer hair cell damage by increasing their inner calcium levels and releasing the chemical messenger ATP. Fuchs  team knew that type II afferent neurons can respond to ATP, so they damaged outer hair cells while monitoring type II neurons in surgically removed inner ear tissue. Indeed, outer hair cell rupture caused robust excitation of type II neurons. Fuchs says that the ATP released by the supporting cells is probably what gets the neurons to fire, and the supporting cells might release ATP in response to ATP that leaks out of the ruptured outer hair cells. But he noted that  outer hair cells don t have to rupture to release ATP. Progressive damage caused by loud noises or other stress is enough to increase ATP levels in the fluid of the inner ear.  Over evolutionary time, such a mechanism could have evolved to help mammals avoid further damage to their hearing. Such effects might depend on heightened sensitivity of the type II neurons after trauma, akin to the heightened sensitivity of pain-sensing nerves in damaged skin. Hypersensitivity to loud sound (hyperacusis) is a paradoxical consequence of hearing loss in many people. Everyday noises such as slamming doors, clanking dishes and barking dogs can become irritating and even painful. The good news, Fuchs says, is that the analogies with pain elsewhere in the body provide guidance for future studies. For example, a compound that suppresses pain-sensing nerve cells elsewhere, also prevented type II afferent neurons from firing in response to outer hair cell death. At present, Fuchs cautions, this is a restricted experimental result.  But, it provides a  proof of concept  for treating pain associated with inner ear damage. And the Fuchs laboratory plans to explore this question in their ongoing research.  Johns Hopkins Medicine   press release Liua C, Glowatzki E, Fuchs PA.

For almost two decades, neuroscientists have known that this area, called the fusiform face area (FFA), plays a vital role in the brain's ability to recognize faces and objects that an individual has learned to identify. Now a new study, accepted for publication by the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, has taken this a step further by finding that the thickness of the cortex in the FFA as measured using magnetic resonance imaging can predict a person's ability to recognize faces and objects. ""It is the first time we have found a direct relationship between brain structure and visual expertise,"" said Isabel Gauthier, David K. Wilson Professor of Psychology at Vanderbilt University, who directed the study. ""It shows more clearly than ever that this part of the brain is relevant to both face and object recognition abilities."" Relationships between cortical thickness and other types of processes, such as motor learning and acquisition of musical skills, have been observed before. The relationship seems relatively straightforward: the process of learning to type faster or play a violin causes the neurons in the relevant area of the cortex to make new connections, which causes the cortex to appear thicker. However, the link between cortical thickness and how well we recognize faces and objects turns out to have a surprising twist. To establish this surprising relationship, Gauthier and her co-authors, post-doctoral fellow Rankin McGugin and Ana Van Gulick from Carnegie Mellon University, measured the ability of 27 men to identify objects from several different categories divided into two groups: living and non-living. They also tested subjects' ability at recognizing faces. Using advanced brain-mapping techniques, the researchers were able to pinpoint the exact location of the FFA in each individual and to measure its cortical thickness. When they analyzed the results, the researchers found that the men with thicker FFA cortex performed generally better at identifying non-living objects while those having thinner FFA cortex performed better at identifying faces and living objects. ""It was really a surprise to find that the effects are in opposite directions for faces and non-living objects,"" said Gauthier. ""One possibility that we are exploring is that we acquire expertise for faces much earlier than we learn about cars, and brain development is quite different earlier versus later in life."" There are significant sex differences in facial and object recognition, so the researchers would like to repeat the experiment using women to see if this same relation holds true.

The findings are enhancing understanding of how schizophrenia affects the workings of the brain, and open the way to new approaches for future drug therapies. Involving scientists from Griffith University's Eskitis Institute for Drug Discovery, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and University College Dublin, the research is published in the journal Translational Psychiatry. According to the Eskitis Institute's Professor Emeritus Alan Mackay-Sim, analysis of almost 1000 proteins in patients' stem cells indicated their cellular machinery for making new proteins was reduced, with the rate of protein synthesis greatly impaired. ""Proteins are the workhorses of all cells and make up most of a cell's structure and functions,"" says Professor Mackay-Sim, whose Griffith team included Dr Yongjun Fan and Mr Nicholas Matigian. ""Cells live in a very dynamic environment and protein synthesis, which is so important for brain development, function and learning, is impacted by environmental and genetic factors. ""It is now becoming clearer that many small genetic variants are linked because they share control of cellular functions, in this case protein synthesis. ""If protein synthesis is altered even slightly, many cell functions would also be subtly changed. This could affect brain development and adult brain function in schizophrenia. ""This work helps make sense of the rapid advances in genetics that have identified hundreds of risk genes for schizophrenia."" Interestingly, the same issue of Translational Psychiatry reports contrasting findings from a second research collaboration, also involving Professor Mackay-Sim, University College Dublin and a laboratory in the US. This study used a different kind of stem cell generated from people with schizophrenia, namely induced pluripotent stem cells. These are genetically engineered from skin cells and stimulated to turn into stem cells resembling the neural progenitor cells that give rise to the brain in the developing human embryo. When the proteins from these cells were analyzed, the patients' cells were found to have more protein-making machinery and also made proteins more quickly than cells from healthy controls. ""However, while on the surface this seems like a contradiction, the two studies support each other by showing that the regulation of protein synthesis is subtly disturbed in the cells of people with schizophrenia,"" says Professor Mackay-Sim. ""The studies seem to show that the on/off switch for protein synthesis may be altered in different cells or at different life stages in schizophrenia. ""This provides many ways in which brain development and function is altered in schizophrenia, and many routes for the ways in which genes and the environment interact to cause schizophrenia.""

But even seemingly trivial actions such as crossing stepping-stones on a river or just walking in a straight line require these very same skills. The group of Dr. Megan Carey, principal investigator at Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, has developed a novel tool to investigate how the brain generates coordinated movement. ""People who suffer damage to a part of the brain called the cerebellum display impairments in walking and other activities that require balance and coordination"", explains Dr. Carey. To gain deeper understanding into these problems, many studies use genetic model systems such as mice. ""Mice with cerebellar damage exhibit similar symptoms to those of human patients,"" says Dr. Carey, ""and they offer powerful genetic tools that enable us to investigate the neural circuits that underlie these problems."" However, until now it has been difficult for researchers to measure specific deficits of coordination in mice. This obstacle was recently overcome by a team of researchers who combined engineering, computer science and biological approaches to develop LocoMouse, a tool that tracks the fine details of locomotion in mice. ""We developed LocoMouse as the first step in our large-scale project to reveal the neural circuits that generate coordinated walking, for which the lab has recently received significant support for from the European Research Council,"" says Carey. Using LocoMouse, the researchers analyzed locomotion in mice with cerebellar degeneration, and were surprised to discover that many of the mouse's movements were unexpectedly intact. For instance, in contrast to previous findings, the forward movements of individual paws in the mice with cerebellar degeneration were indistinguishable from those of unaffected mice. Instead, the researchers found that motor deficits were restricted to coordinated movements those that required the ability to predict and compensate for movements taking place across the body. They report their findings in a new study in the journal eLife. The team is now using LocoMouse to explore the relation between the activity of neurons in the cerebellum and the generation of coordinated movement. They are doing this by recording neural activity in behaving animals and also by using genetic and optical tools to manipulate neural activity and investigating the effects on behavior. Finally, while the researchers initially developed LocoMouse to investigate the role of the cerebellum in coordination, they hope the tool will be useful for researchers interested in locomotion and motor control in general. ""We are making the tracking code freely available, and we tried to keep it flexible, so that anyone who wants to use it will be able to easily capture the aspects of movement they find most interesting,"" concludes Carey.

When DNA evidence connects a defendant to a crime, courts require a match statistic. Jurors rely on this match strength to help decide guilt. But the reliability of some match statistics has been questioned. The Combined Probability of Inclusion (CPI) is a popular match statistic for DNA mixtures. For 15 years, crime laboratories have generated CPI statistics on hundreds of thousands of mixtures. However, a new study shows that CPI behaves more like a random number generator than like a reliable measure of human identification. The research article  Inclusion probability for DNA mixtures is a subjective one-sided match statistic unrelated to identification information  was published recently. The paper explains why CPI always gives the same  one in a million  answer, instead of providing accurate match information.  How DNA mixtures are interpreted affects criminal justice and public safety,  says author Dr. Mark Perlin of Cybergenetics.  The inclusion method compares a mixture with a suspect, relying on CPI for statistical support. But if CPI does not accurately convey identification information, its patina of science lends no meaningful support.  The FBI s free PopStats software includes a CPI calculator. However, a 2005 NIST study showed 69 crime laboratories reporting a wide range of inaccurate statistics (from ten thousand to hundred trillion, or just  inconclusive ) on the same mixture sample. The FBI has never developmentally validated its CPI software. The current CPI controversy has shuttered the Washington, DC crime lab, and sparked reconsideration of 24 thousand cases in Texas. Conviction integrity may require re-examination of past CPI mixture cases. Previously reported inculpatory statistics can be irrelevant or unreliable, while an inconclusive result can mask exculpatory evidence. Cybergenetics develops patented TrueAllele technology that objectively interprets DNA evidence. Seven published peer-reviewed studies havevalidated TrueAllele s reliability. The system has examined mixture evidence from most states, overcoming admissibility challenges in seven. The company provides computer systems and databases to crime labs, and expert witness services.

The study began by identifying a marker for the deadly cancer glioblastoma multiforme in a database of cancer genomes that amasses genetic sequences from labs around the world. In that atlas, Weibo Cai, associate professor of radiology, noticed a gene called CD146 that is highly active in glioblastoma. ""When we looked for a potential target, CD146 seemed ideal, as it was correlated with poor outcome,"" says Cai. The CD146 gene places a unique protein, also called CD146, on the surface of cells. Cai's strategy focused on an antibody that can recognize the CD146 protein. Antibodies are complexly shaped molecules that can attach to specific proteins. In biology, antibodies transmit information across a cell membrane to stimulate or silence various processes. In medicine, they are used to identify, alter or kill cells having the correct protein on the surface.  After Cai's group created an antibody that selectively links to the CD146 protein, they joined it to a copper isotope that is easily seen in a PET scanner. Then they implanted a human glioblastoma sample into a mouse, injected the antibody-marker combination into the blood, and waited for the antibody to spread through the animal. When the mouse was placed in a PET scanner, the instrument identified tumors with a high level of CD146 protein on the outside of their cells. The signal from a genetically distinct glioblastoma with low CD146 activity was much weaker.  Identifying cancer at the cellular level is a chief treatment goal, as most cancers kill when cancer cells metastasize and ""seed"" tumors in new locations. Preliminary data from Cai's lab suggests that the CD146 marker is associated with cancer stem cells - primitive tumor cells that are considered key in metastasis.  Beyond that, the research could go in several directions, Cai says. ""We've created a tag that - at least in our mouse model - is highly specific for this aggressive brain cancer. If the technique proves out in further tests, it could be used to diagnose some strains of aggressive glioblastoma, and also to evaluate treatment progress or even to test potential drugs."" Because CD146 also appears on some ovarian, liver and lung tumors, the technique could have a broader reach. ""Our tests with other tumor types confirm an association between the level of CD146 activity and the aggressiveness of the tumor,"" Cai says.  ""This targets tumors with the worst survival,"" Cai adds, ""but I want to emphasize that human trials are some years in the future."" ""Because this biomarker occurs in several other aggressive cancers, and is implicated in specific cellular processes that we know play a role in metastasis, these results could have far-ranging implications for improving outcomes in cancers for which there is currently much need for improvement,"" says Peter Choyke, director of the Molecular Imaging Program at the National Cancer Institute.  ""Their noninvasive test for this biomarker could be helpful in many ways, including surgical removal, detection of recurrences and monitoring of therapy,"" Choyke adds. ""Because this approach only applies to an identifiable subset of this brain cancer, I see it as another step toward the goal of personalized medicine."" The study also demonstrated an improved system for creating antibodies that is ""faster, cheaper and easier than all previous methods,"" says Cai. ""Most methods generate antibodies that recognize short fragments of the target protein, whereas our antibody recognizes the target in the biologically active form. So the antibodies can be readily used in living subjects, such as the animal models in this study and potentially in patients.""","Published: November 10, 2015"

Yet as inseparable as the date palm might seem from today s Middle East, one question remains: how did they become what they are today? Now, researchers at NYU Abu Dhabi have developed a map of genetic changes across the genome of date palms. They have also established genetic differences between Middle Eastern and North African date palms, an important discovery that sheds light on that long elusive question. In a new paper researchers at the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology at NYUAD have identified more than 7 million mutations or nucleotide polymorphisms that are found between date palm varieties. They have also identified genes that may be important in fruit ripening, fruit color and disease resistance in dates. The study also offers two possible explanations for the crop s origin. One suggests that contemporary date palms descend from two distinct domestication events   an early event in the Middle East, and a later one in North Africa. A second hypothesis proposes that date palms were first cultivated in the Middle East and later spread to North Africa, but somewhere along the way North African dates were crossed with a wild predecessor. The research is part of the 100 Dates! genome sequencing project led by Dorothy Schiff Professor of Genomics Michael Purugganan. The project s goal is to learn more about the traits and evolution of the date palm through analysis of the plant s genome.  The data on diversity in the genomes helps us to identify genes that may help develop better date palms,  said Purugganan, who is also a professor of biology.  It also tells us how date palms evolve, and provides clues as to where date palms came from.  Evidence from archeological digs suggest that the origin of domesticated dates is in the Gulf. Seeds have been found on Dalma Island, Abu Dhabi that are more than 7,000 years old. Cultivated dates seem to appear about 3,000 years later in North Africa, according to excavation of ancient sites. The team analyzed the genome of 62 varieties of date palm from 12 countries. Seventeen samples came from North Africa; 36 inhabit the Middle East; nine are native to South Asia. The work was a collaboration between NYUAD and UAE University, as well as other researchers in Dubai, Iraq, US, Syria, Tunisia, Pakistan and Qatar. The wild ancestor of the date palm is elusive, but identifying one would provide scientists with valuable information. Khaled Hazzouri, senior research scientist at NYUAD and lead author on the paper, entitled Whole genome re-sequencing of date palms yield insights into diversification of a fruit tree crop, says:  It is important to know the identity and geographic origin of the wild progenitor of a domesticated species because it will help us understand the evolutionary process underlying domestication and the nature of the genetic changes underlying domestication.  Purugganan, Hazzouri, and the team also discovered a genetic mutation that causes the trees to produce either yellow or red fruit. Interestingly, the date palm shares this genetic mutation with its very distant cousin, the oil palm. These two plants are separated by approximately 60 million years of evolution, so it s surprising that genes in both species would code for the same trait.  This similarity tells us that evolution uses the same genes in different species to get the same result,  Purugganan said. It s possible that information like this could be used by plant breeders to engineer date varieties that have particular traits. For example, since some varieties of date palms can live on water with high salinity, farmers who grow crops in arid terrain could plant date palm varieties suitable for that type of climate.  The 100 Dates! project is still in its first phase, and there is considerable research yet to be done. The next phase will include obtaining more samples and mapping important genes, and future research will include collaborations with researchers at UAE University in Al Ain and the University of Baghdad.

She is now cancer free and doing well. This breakthrough comes from GOSH and UCL Institute of Child Health s (ICH) pioneering research teams, who together are developing treatments and cures for some of the rarest childhood diseases.  Chemotherapy successfully treats many patients with leukaemia but it can be ineffective in patients with particularly aggressive forms of the disease where cancer cells can remain hidden or resistant to drug therapy. Recent developments have led to treatments where immune cells, known as T-cells, are gathered from patients and programmed using gene therapy to recognise and kill cancerous cells. Multiple clinical trials are underway, but individuals with leukaemia, or those who have had several rounds of chemotherapy, often don t have enough healthy T-cells to collect and modify meaning this type of treatment is not appropriate. A team at GOSH has now used modified T-cells from donors, known as UCART19 cells, to treat a one-year-old child with an aggressive form of ALL who had unsuccessful chemotherapy and for whom palliative care was deemed the only option left. The treatment works by adding new genes to healthy donor T-cells, which arm them against leukaemia. Using molecular tools (TALEN ) that act like very accurate scissors, specific genes are then cut in order to make the T-cells behave in two specific ways. Firstly, the cells became invisible to a powerful leukaemia drug that would usually kill them and secondly they are reprogrammed to only target and fight against leukaemia cells. The team at GOSH and the UCL ICH, along with investigators at University College London and biotech company Cellectis, had been developing  off-the-shelf  banks of these donor T-cells and the first of which was due to be used for final stage testing ahead of clinical trials. But, after hearing about this infant, the team received special permission to try the new treatment early. Professor Waseem Qasim, Professor of Cell and Gene Therapy at UCL ICH and Consultant Immunologist at GOSH, explains: ""The approach was looking incredibly successful in laboratory studies, and so when I heard there were no options left for treating this child s disease, I thought  why don t we use the new UCART19 cells?  ""The treatment was highly experimental and we had to get special permissions, but she appeared ideally suited for this type of approach."" The patient s parents were also keen to try the treatment. Mum, Lisa, says: ""We didn t want to accept palliative care and so we asked the doctors to try anything for our daughter, even if it hadn t been tried before."" The treatment consisted of 1ml of UCART19 cells delivered via intravenous line in around 10 minutes. After the cells had been delivered, the patient spent several months in isolation to protect her from infections while her immune system was extremely weak. Throughout this time, the patient stayed generally well. After several weeks there were signs that the treatment was working. Professor Paul Veys, Director of bone marrow transplant at GOSH and the patient s lead clinician, says: ""As this was the first time that the treatment had been used, we didn t know if or when it would work and so we were over the moon when it did. Her leukaemia was so aggressive that such a response is almost a miracle."" Once doctors were confident that the leukaemia cells had been removed, the patient was given a bone marrow transplant to replace her entire blood and immune system which had been wiped out by the treatment. The child is now recovering well at home, although she returns to GOSH regularly to check that her bone marrow cells are healthy and blood counts continuing to normalise. Professor Qasim says: ""We have only used this treatment on one very strong little girl, and we have to be cautious about claiming that this will be a suitable treatment option for all children. But, this is a landmark in the use of new gene engineering technology and the effects for this child have been staggering. ""If replicated, it could represent a huge step forward in treating leukaemia and other cancers."" Full clinical trials funded by Cellectis are now being planned to test UCART19 cells in larger groups of patients and are set to begin early in 2016.  Cellectis main objective is to provide cancer patients with an accessible, cost-effective, off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR-T therapies across all geographies. With clinical trial for the first gene-edited UCART on the horizon, it could be the beginning of a revolution in cancer immunotherapy,  says Dr. Andr  Choulika, Chairman and CEO of Cellectis.","Published: November 10, 2015"

The study is also a proof of principle that tests for cancer DNA in the bloodstream can be used to detect drug resistance mutations   allowing patients who will not benefit from one drug to be given an alternative treatment instead. Researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, and the University of Trento, Italy, analysed 274 blood samples from 97 patients using state-of-the-art DNA sequencing techniques.                                 They found that mutations in a gene called the androgen receptor (AR) predicted resistance to the prostate cancer drug abiraterone, and that patients with these mutations had poorer survival. Abiraterone, which was discovered at the ICR, is now standard treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer   but while it is highly effective in many patients, 30-60% do not respond. So researchers have been searching for a marker that will help predict in advance which men will benefit from the drug, and who should be given a different treatment. Researchers discovered that men who harbour either a specific mutation or an increase in the number of copies of the AR gene, were 7.8 times less likely to have a reduction of more than 90% in their PSA levels, a widely used test to monitor the response of prostate cancer. The study also found that in about 15% of men given abiraterone who did not have either mutation before starting treatment, this was acquired as the drug stopped working and appeared in the bloodstream several months before patients developed any symptoms. Blood tests are particularly valuable in cancer patients because biopsies are often difficult to perform and can carry risks. Even when biopsies are possible, they only give a snapshot of cancer genetics in a small specific area, whereas blood tests can give information that is more representative of multiple different tumours around the body. Dr Gerhardt Attard, Clinician Scientist at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Consultant Medical Oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said:  The discovery of abiraterone was an important step forward for patients with advanced prostate cancer, but we know it doesn t work for all men, and we ve been searching for a marker that will tell us in advance which men will benefit. We re delighted to have developed a test that appears to predict very accurately whether a patient will respond to abiraterone, and that it can be performed on blood samples   removing the need to take a biopsy.  We are now planning a clinical trial involving up to 600 men in which we aim to prospectively show that men who are positive with our test have significantly greater benefit from chemotherapy in preference to abiraterone or similar drugs. Critically, we believe that this sort of technology would be relatively straightforward to implement in NHS hospitals, making it accessible to a large number of patients. Additionally, looking at tumour DNA in the blood of patients could potentially give us an overall picture of why the cancer is progressing all over the body, unlike a biopsy that only tells us about the area sampled.  Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said:  Abiraterone has extended the lives of many thousands of men in the UK, with fewer side-effects than chemotherapy, and we are really proud that it was discovered here at the ICR. But we don t stop at taking a new treatment like abiraterone to patients   it s also essential to continue to conduct research on these new drugs, to make sure they are being used as effectively as possible.   This new study finds that by analysing tumour DNA present in the bloodstream, we should be able to personalise treatment with abiraterone, so that only those who will benefit from the drug will receive it. It is the latest step forward in the new era we are in of precision cancer medicine, where rather than using a treatment in the hope that a patient will benefit, we can look at tumour DNA in advance and be much more confident that a particular treatment will work.  Associate Professor Francesca Demichelis, leader of the Computational Oncology Group at the University of Trento, Italy, said:  Being able to quantify tumor DNA from a blood sample and to characterize structural changes of the DNA that are predictive of treatment response is powerful. This is especially true as a blood-based test gives us a global picture of the patient s tumor burden rather than a focal snapshot as with a standard biopsy.  In principle the same computational approach we adopted in this study is applicable across tumor types. This study represents a step towards sensitive and specific detection of resistance to targeted therapies.  Dr Emma Smith, Cancer Research UK's senior science information officer, said: ""Abiraterone, a drug which Cancer Research UK helped to develop, gives men with advanced prostate cancer a much-needed treatment option and more time with their loved ones. But it doesn't work for everyone.  If these important early results bear up in larger clinical trials it could lead to a test which would indicate which patients might benefit more from trying other therapies instead.""  Dr Iain Frame, Director of Research at Prostate Cancer UK said: ""We know that a one-size-fits-all approach to treating prostate cancer doesn't work, and research like this is crucially important in helping us understand which treatments will - and won't - work best for each individual. When the clock is ticking for a man with advanced prostate cancer, finding out early that his treatment needs changing can not only save precious time, but can also help avoid unpleasant side effects from a treatment that longer works for him.  Research like this wouldn t be possible without the thousands of people who take part in Movember every year   and so with another campaign upon us, we can all do something to help the fight against prostate cancer.

That first printer was sensitive enough to work with laboratory grown stem cells derived from embryonic stem cells harvested generations ago. Now, working in conjunction with Roslin Cellab, the team has refined their printer so that it s gentle enough to enable 3D printing of so-called  induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells , derived from a donor s own adult cells, which are even more delicate than the lab-grown embryonic stem cells. This means the team will be able to print the cells in three dimensions without damaging the cells  biological functions such as their ability to make a wide range of different cell types such as liver, heart and brain cells.  Reduce dependence on animal testing The short term aims of the team are to use the cell printing process to make miniature 3D human tissues for general testing of pharmaceutical drugs and in the process reduce the current dependence on live animal testing. Once established, specifically made tissue from each patient would enable doctors to prescribe drugs most likely to work and with fewest side effects. Dr Will Shu, Associate Professor at EPS, said,  This study is the first to demonstrate that human induced pluripotent stem cells, that is stem cells derived from the adult patient s own cells, can be bioprinted without adversely affecting their biological functions; that our 3D printing process is gentle enough to do this. In this instance we showed that after printing we could turn the stem cells into liver cells.  The ability to bioprint stem cells while either maintaining their pluripotency, their ability to develop into all types of cells in the body, or indeed directing their differentiation into specific cell types, will pave the way for producing organoids, or tissues on demand, from patient specific cells. These could then be used for animal-free drug development and personalised medicine.  Roslin Cellab s Dr. Jason King, who is also involved in establishing the new European Bank for Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (EBiSC), stated this would offer great potential for tissue engineers looking to use iPS cells made from donors with specific diseases to create new human disease models.

Packaging approximately 1.8m of DNA into something as small as a cell nucleus is no mean feat, but unpacking it again to access the required sections and genes? That requires organisation. In a nutshell, this is achieved through DNA condensed and packaged as chromatin, a complex of DNA and proteins called histones, which is constantly modified as the DNA is accessed. The histone proteins need constant replacement to maintain the correct chromatin structure required for all DNA related processes in the cell. To understand more about the importance of histone replacement, researchers at the Babraham Institute and MRC Clinical Sciences Centre used developing mouse egg cells, oocytes. Developing oocytes provide a system where the mechanics of how DNA is packaged into cells can be explored in the absence of DNA replication, as egg cells do not divide. However, their genomes are highly active as the development of the egg involves widespread turning on and off of genes and DNA modification before the mature egg cell is ready for fertilisation. The work relied on the Institute's expertise in single cell analysis, allowing accurate mapping of the epigenetic landscape in precious cells. The researchers deleted a histone chaperone protein - one of a group of proteins that are responsible for replacing histones in the chromatin structure - and analysed the effects on egg cell development, DNA integrity and accumulation of DNA methylation. ""Oocytes lacking the Hira histone chaperone showed severe developmental defects which often led to cell death."" said Dr Gavin Kelsey, research group leader in the Institute's Epigenetics programme and author on the paper. ""The whole system is disrupted, eggs accumulate DNA damage and the altered chromatin means that genes cannot be efficiently silenced or activated. But we also uncovered an intricate relationship between the different epigenetic systems operating in the oocyte, where failure to ensure normal histone levels severely compromised deposition of methylation on the underlying DNA."" The research addresses the importance of histone turnover in maintaining genomic fidelity and adds to our understanding about the mechanisms in place to protect the integrity of the genome as it is remodelled and reshaped. Studying this in the context of the developing oocytes provides new insights into our dynamic genome, unclouded by the complications of DNA replication, and also reveals how important maintaining chromatin dynamics is to the integrity of our gametes.","Published: November 10, 2015"

""ER stress has long been linked to Type 1 diabetes and Parkinson's disease, among others, but this is the first indication that it is also playing a role in common heart attacks and death from heart disease,"" said senior author Svati H. Shah, M.D., associate professor of medicine and faculty at the Molecular Physiology Institute at Duke. ""It's also exciting that we are able to measure this ER stress in a small drop of blood, providing a potential way to intercede and lower the risk of a major cardiovascular event."" Even after mapping the human genome and finding genetic traits associated with cardiovascular disease, the mechanisms underlying the inherited susceptibility to this disease have not been fully understood. Shah said the Duke team's research approach -- using a variety of analytical methods measuring over a million data points in 3,700 patients -- enabled them to fill in some of the missing steps leading to cardiovascular disease, which is often inherited. ""With genetics, everyone is lumped together if they share a trait,"" Shah said. ""But everyone knows if you have two people with the same trait, but one is overweight, smokes and has a bad lifestyle, that person has a different pathway that led to heart disease than someone who is normal weight, doesn't smoke, eats right and exercises."" The Duke team focused on the intermediates between the genes and the disease pathway. This involved metabolomics -- an analysis of the metabolites, or trace chemicals, left behind as the byproducts from cellular processes. Among a group of about 3,700 patients referred for cardiac catheterization in the CATHGEN study, Shah and colleagues performed a genome-wide analysis of specific metabolite levels that had previously been identified as predictors of cardiovascular disease. In their earlier work, the researchers had flagged these metabolites as markers for cardiovascular disease, but had not known how they were generated or what the underlying biological pathways were. The current study resolved that question, finding that these genes were directly linked to ER stress, which occurs when the endoplasmic reticulum organelle becomes overworked in its job managing excess and damaged cellular proteins. Shah and colleagues then took an epigenetics and transcriptomics approach to determine what the differences were between patients with high or low levels of metabolites. Once again, the ER stress pathway came up as a key component. ""Using this multi-platform 'omics' approach, we identified these novel genetic variants associated with metabolite levels and with cardiovascular disease itself,"" Shah said. ""We don't believe that the metabolites themselves are causing heart attacks -- they might just be byproducts of a dysregulated process that people are genetically susceptible to -- but that's something we need to study further.""","Published: November 10, 2015"

The body s circadian clocks coordinate behaviors like eating and sleeping, as well as physiological activity like metabolism, with the Earth s 24-hour light-dark cycle. There s a master clock in the brain, as well as peripheral clocks located in individual organs. When genetics, environment or behavior disrupt the synchrony of these clocks, metabolic disorders can develop.  In a previous publication, Northwestern Medicine investigators showed that a circadian clock in the pancreas is essential for regulating insulin secretion and balancing blood sugar levels in mice. The scientists demonstrated that knocking out clock genes led to obesity and type 2 diabetes, but they still had much to learn if they wanted to manipulate clock action to treat the conditions.   We knew that the pancreas didn t work if we removed these clock genes, but we didn t know how the genes were affecting the normal function of the pancreas,  said principal investigator Dr. Joe Bass, chief of endocrinology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a Northwestern Medicine physician.  Clock genes are responsible for producing transcription factors, special proteins that help tell a cell how to function. In the new study, Bass s laboratory revealed thousands of genes in the pancreas that the clock s transcription factors control in rhythm with the planet s daily rotation from light to dark.    We established a new gene map that shows how the entire repertoire of factors produced in the pancreas maintain and anticipate daily changes in the external environment,  Bass said.  These factors are all tied to the rotation of the Earth -- to the timekeeping mechanism that has evolved to control when we sleep, wake up, eat and store nutrients each day.  Bass s team focused on cells in the pancreas called beta cells, which secrete insulin into the blood stream to help the body absorb glucose -- sugar -- to use for energy. Using genome-wide sequencing technology on beta cells with both intact and disrupted clock gene function, the scientists were able to lay out the map of transcription factors and genes. In ongoing research, Bass s group continues to study how the body s circadian clocks interact and how their rhythm is thrown off -- not just in diabetes, but also during the normal aging process and from day-to-day conditions like jetlag, stress or dietary changes.  This study reinforces the idea that clocks operating in cells are fundamental to health,  Bass said.  They represent an important untapped target for improving the functions of cells in the pancreas.

In a sense, that s how scientists at Brown University accomplished a new advance in tissue engineering. The team reports culturing cells to make extracellular matrix (ECM) of two types and five different alignments with the strength found in natural tissue and without using any artificial chemicals that could make it incompatible to implant.ECM is the fibrous material between cells in tissues like skin, cartilage, or tendon that gives them their strength, stretchiness, squishiness, and other mechanical properties. To help patients heal wounds and injuries, engineers and physicians have strived to make ECM in the lab that s aligned as well as it is when cells make it in the body. So far, though, they ve struggled to recreate ECM. Using artificial materials provides strength, but those don t interact well with the body. Attempts to extract and build upon natural ECM have yielded material that s too weak to reimplant. The Brown team tried a different approach to making both collagen, which is strong, and elastin, which is stretchy, with different alignments of their fibers. They cultured ECM-making cells in specially designed molds that promoted the cells to make their own natural but precisely guided ECM. Tighten up As the cell culture grows, cells pull on each other, aligning the extracellular matrix.  What we hypothesized is that the cells are making it the same way they do in the body, because we re starting them in a more natural environment,  said lead author Jacquelyn Schell, assistant professor (research) of molecular pharmacology, physiology and biotechnology.  We re not adding exogenous materials.  The strategy built on the insight that when cells clump together and grow in culture, they pull on each other and communicate as they would in the body, Schell said. The molds therefore were made from agarose so that cells wouldn t stick to the sides or bottom. Instead they huddled together. To guide ECM growth in particular alignments, the researchers used molds with very specific shapes, often constrained by pegs the cells had to grow around. For instance, to make a rod with collagen fibers aligned along its length (like a tendon) they cultured chondrocyte cells in a dog bone-shaped mold with loops on either end. To make a skin-like  trampoline  of elastin, where the ECM fibers run in all directions, they cultured fibroblast cells to grow in an open area suspended at the center of a honeycomb shape.  The placement of the pegs that this group of cells wraps itself around and then exerts force on each other is what dictates their alignment and the direction of the ECM they are going to synthesize,  said senior author Jeffrey Morgan, professor of medical science and engineering and co-director of Brown s Center for Biomedical Engineering.  That s a new ability to control the cells  synthesis of extracellular matrix.  After the researchers grew various forms of ECM, they did some stress testing. They took the dog bone-shaped tissues to the lab of Christian Franck, assistant professor of engineering, and together made precise measurements of the tissue strength under the force of being pulled apart. The measurements confirmed the self-assembled tissue was about as strong as that found in some of the body s tissues, such as skin, cartilage or blood vessels. The team s next goal is to identify a prospective clinical application, Morgan said. The lab will pursue the needed testing to see if this new way of growing ECM can help future patients.","Published: November 10, 2015"

Without oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood, brain cells start to die. Recovery after stroke depends on a process called axonal sprouting, in which healthy neurons send out new projections, or extensions. These  sprouts  generate new connections between brain cells or reestablish some of the connections that were lost or damaged during stroke, resulting in partial recovery. Previous studies suggested that a protein called growth and differentiation factor 10 (GDF10) was involved in the early stages of axonal sprouting. Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael and his colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles, took a closer look at GDF10 to identify how it contributes to the process. Their work was supported in part by NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).  By examining animal models of stroke as well as brain tissue from human autopsies, the team found that GDF10 was activated very early after stroke. Using rodent neurons and human neurons derived from stem cells, the researchers showed that GDF10 stimulated axonal growth and increased the length of the axons. To see whether GDF10 is important for functional recovery after stroke, the researchers treated mouse models of stroke with GDF10 in a biopolymer hydrogel, which releases the protein to the site of injury over a 2- to 3-week period. Treated animals performed various motor tasks significantly faster and with fewer errors after stroke than control animals. In contrast, when the researchers blocked GDF10 production, the animals didn t perform as well on the motor tasks, suggesting that repair mechanisms were impaired without GDF10. To understand the pathways by which GDF10 might be working, the researchers isolated cortical neurons after stroke and examined their gene expression profiles. To see if the mechanisms of repair are similar to axonal sprouting during normal development when mice are forming new connections, they also examined cortical neurons from young mice. The analysis revealed that GDF10 affected a set of genes after stroke that was distinct from those involved in development.  We found that regeneration is a unique program in the brain that occurs after injury. It is not simply Development 2.0, using the same mechanisms that take place when the nervous system is forming,  Carmichael says.  These findings help to elucidate the mechanisms of repair following stroke,  says Dr. Francesca Bosetti, stroke program director at NINDS.  Identifying this key protein further advances our knowledge of how the brain heals itself from the devastating effects of stroke, and may help to develop new therapeutic strategies to promote recovery.

Our saliva consists of water and mucus, among other things, and the mucus plays an important role. It stimulates white blood cells to build a good defence against invaders, according to a group of researchers at Lund University in Sweden together with colleagues from Copenhagen and Odense in Denmark.  White blood cells are among other places located in the oral mucosa, and they represent the body s first line of defence against infectious agents. The mucus in the mouth causes the white blood cells to throw out a  net  that traps bacteria , explains Ole S rensen from the Division of Infection Medicine. This trapping mechanism is in itself not new   it was first discovered about a decade ago. But the Lund research group now shows that the nets in the oral mucosa specifically, have special properties. These nets are much better at capturing and killing bacteria than the nets produced by white blood cells in other parts of the body.  It appears to be precisely the mucus in the saliva that stimulates white blood cells to form these effective nets of DNA and proteins , says Ole S rensen. The researchers also found that patients with two diseases that both cause mouth ulcers lack saliva that manages to stimulate a successful net formation. One of the two diseases is aphthous stomatitis, a common ailment, which means that a person will often develop ulcers in the mouth and on the lips. In the best cases, the ulcers are minor and heal within a week, but they can also be major and more long-lasting. The second disease is Beh et s disease, which is unusual in Scandinavia but more common in the eastern Mediterranean region and further east. This disease causes problems not only in the mouth but also on the genitals and in the eyes.  We cannot determine that these diseases are caused by the mucus s inability to stimulate the white blood cells to produce efficient nets. There may also be another, underlying cause for the ulcers and the changes in the saliva , says Ole S rensen. He hopes to be able to continue researching these connections. As long as the root cause of the disease is unknown, there is no fully effective cure. People with aphthous stomatitis are usually recommended to use special mouthwashes and toothpastes, and patients with Beh et's disease receive anti-inflammatory drugs. The new knowledge about the mucus s formation of nets could possibly lead to new drugs in the future.","Published: November 10, 2015"

Around half the world s population is at risk of malaria and the disease led to an estimated 584,000 deaths in 2013.  MosquirixTM, a malaria vaccine candidate developed by GSK, has just received a positive scientific opinion from the European Medicines Agency for use in young children.  MosquirixTM aims at addressing the objectives set for a first generation vaccine in the WHO malaria vaccine technology roadmap. The roadmap also outlines ambitious goals for second generation vaccines including transmission-blocking vaccines. The latter prevent mosquitoes from transmitting malaria to non-infected persons. The clinical trial is being conducted at Southampton, the lead trial site, and Oxford. It is a dose escalation study, where amounts of the potential vaccine are increased. The study will assess the safety of the vaccine candidate in people and its ability to generate immune responses that inhibit the growth of malaria eggs in mosquitos, preventing transmission of malaria. The vaccine candidate, developed by the team led by Dr Sumi Biswas at the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, is composed of a transmission-blocking antigen from Plasmodium falciparum, the more dangerous form of malaria. The antigen is combined with Imaxio s pro-immunogenic technology IMX313, designed to increase immune responses, and two viral vectors, which are virus carriers modified to be harmless but which can transport the vaccine elements into the body s cells. One of those is a proprietary viral vector from Okairos (acquired by GSK in 2014). It is being administered through a course of treatment developed by the Jenner Institute in Oxford. 'Blocking transmission of malaria by mosquitoes from human to human is increasingly seen as one several complementary ways to fight this very important disease.' said Prof. Adrian Hill, Director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University. 'The malaria vaccine programme at the Jenner Institute is now unique in having vaccines against all stages of the parasite s life cycle in clinical development. The combination of technologies from Oxford, Imaxio & GSK is a very promising way to develop a transmission blocking vaccine candidate.' 'After a first clinical trial involving our pro-immunogenic technology  IMX313  in 2013, we are very enthusiastic to see it reaching the clinic within a second vaccine candidate , said Mr. Alexandre Le Vert, Chief Executive Officer of Imaxio.

The study was led by Dr Nicholas Furnham from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, with colleagues from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), the University of Cambridge, the University of Edinburgh and the Ugandan Ministry of Health. The findings support the hypothesis that allergic reactions are a flawed antibody response towards harmless environmental allergens. It is thought that part of our immune system has evolved to combat and provide immunity against infection by parasitic worms. However, in the absence of parasitic infection, this same arm of the immune system can become hyper-responsive and mistakenly target allergenic proteins in food or the environment. This results in an unregulated allergic response, which can sometimes be lethal.The researchers used computational techniques to predict which proteins in parasitic worms would cause an immune response similar to an allergic reaction in humans. Their experimental studies supported these predictions and, for the first time, they identified a protein in a parasitic worm that is similar to a protein that was previously thought to be encoded only in the genomes of plants. This protein is one of the most common proteins in pollen that causes allergy in humans. Dr Furnham said  This study provides tools that will make it easier for scientists to predict proteins in food and the environment that are likely to cause allergy, and to design protein molecules for treating allergy.  Our findings address an outstanding question: what makes an allergen an allergen? We ve shown that the off-target effects of the immune system in allergy are due to the significant molecular similarities we have identified between environmental allergens and parasitic worm proteins. The findings demonstrate that allergy is the price we pay for having immunity to parasites.  The study was funded by the Wellcome Trust, UK.","Published: November 10, 2015"

Most of us can, thanks to a sense called proprioception, which tells us where our body parts are relative to each other and our environment. Not surprisingly, this sense is essential for normal movement and balance walking, for instance. For decades, biologists have been trying to find the crucial sensor protein in nerve endings that translates muscle and tendon stretching into proprioceptive nerve signals. Now in a study published in Nature Neuroscience, a team led by scientists from The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) has identified this sensor protein in mice. It turns out to be a protein called Piezo2, which was found recently to mediate the sense of touch. ""To the layman it might not seem surprising that touch and proprioception would use the same sensor protein, but within this field there has been a lot of evidence suggesting otherwise so finding that Piezo2 does both was a surprise,"" said lead investigator Ardem Patapoutian, a professor at TSRI and investigator with Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The laboratories of Thomas M. Jessell at Columbia University and Katherine A. Wilkinson at San Jose State University collaborated on the study. Patapoutian and his laboratory specialize in identifying and characterizing sensory transducer proteins and over the past 15 years have identified transducers of cold, heat and pain. In two studies published last year, they identified Piezo2 as the principal sensor for ordinary, non-painful touch in mice. The new findings stem in part from those studies, in which Patapoutian and his team developed transgenic mice that can be made to switch off Piezo2 activity in ""touch"" neurons and other sensory neurons based in the spine. With Piezo2 silenced, the mice showed profound deficits in responding to touch. But they also showed a different kind of deficit. ""Their walking was a bit abnormal, which gave us a hint that some proprioceptive neurons might be affected, too,"" said Seung-Hyun Woo, a research associate in the Patapoutian laboratory who was first author of the new study. In an initial set of experiments for the new study, the team managed to isolate mouse sensory neurons involved in proprioception and tested these neurons' electrical responses to mild mechanical pressure. Such neurons' nerve ends and cell bodies are known to be studded with mechanically activated ion channel proteins, which essentially spring open admitting a surge of ions and triggering an electrical nerve impulse when the surrounding nerve or cell membrane is distorted sufficiently by a stretching of the local muscle tissue. Prior studies had suggested that the main stretch-sensing protein expressed by proprioceptive neurons is one that specializes in admitting sodium ions. However, the team found evidence from these initial tests that the main ion-channel protein on proprioceptive neurons is not a selective sodium-channel protein, but in fact has properties consistent with Piezo2s. The researchers then confirmed that Piezo2 is expressed in mouse proprioceptive neurons and their muscle-embedded nerve ends. To establish Piezo2's role with more certainty, they developed two lines of transgenic mice in which Piezo2 production could be switched off in proprioceptive neurons shortly after the mice were born. The resulting animals showed severe abnormalities in walking and limb positioning. ""Their limbs were everywhere they looked like they were trying to do yoga,"" said Woo. In a final set of experiments, the team found that leg muscle tissue from these mice lacking Piezo2 tissue with proprioceptive nerves embedded produced almost no nerve signals in response to muscle stretching, whereas muscle tissue from normal mice produced robust signals. ""The data that we have now in support of Piezo2's role in proprioception are really overwhelming,"" said Patapoutian. While the finding is a milestone in sensory neuroscience, it may also lead to a better understanding of some human diseases relating to proprioception. For example, a genetic disorder known as distal arthrogryposis type 5, whose sufferers are born with severely contracted joints, was found in 2013 by Patapoutian and colleagues to be caused by a mutation to the human version of Piezo2. The Scripps Research Institute   press release Woo S-H et al. Piezo2 is the principal mechanotransduction channel for proprioception.

However, in the future, all doctors will need to do is cut a tunnel of 5 mm in diameter through the bone using a miniature robot named NiLiBoRo. The system is capable of adjusting its path while drilling through bone to steer around sensitive tissue such as blood vessels and nerves. Researchers will be displaying the new technology at the Compamed exhibition in Germany that takes place November 16-19, 2015. Surgery is unavoidable for treating inner ear tumors, but the inner ear is difficult to access. This is because it is covered by a cranial bone known as the mastoid, or petrosal bone. What's more, the surrounding tissue contains lots of nerves and blood vessels. For this reason the surgeons will cut out as much of the mastoid bone as needed until they have located each one of these sensitive structures. Only then can they be sure not to damage them. What this entails most of the time is the removal of the entire bone. The hole thus created is filled in with fatty tissue taken from the abdomen after the completion of the procedure. In the future this operation will be performed in a less invasive fashion, requiring just a small hole measuring 5 mm in diameter through which the tumor can be resected from the inner ear. The technology that makes this possible goes by the name of NiLiBoRo, a German acronym which stands for ""Non-linear Drilling Robot."" The system is being developed by researchers in the Mannheim Project Group for Automation in Medicine and Biotechnology, part of the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology and Automation IPA, in cooperation with the Technical University of Darmstadt, the University of Aachen, and the D sseldorf University Clinic. Drilling machines capable of boring a tunnel through bone already exist, but they can do so only in a straight line. ""NiLiBoRo is the first one that can drill around corners as well,"" says project group scientist Lennart Karstensen. It is this particular characteristic that makes it possible to perform minimally invasive surgery on inner ear tumors. If the tunnel were to run in a straight line, it would at times come troublingly close to hitting nerves. To avoid injuring nerve tissue, the tunnel would have to be no more than 1 to 2 mm in diameter. However, it is impossible to perform surgery through such a small opening. The NiLiBoRo on the other hand is capable of steering around sensitive areas. This makes it possible to achieve a tunnel diameter of 5 m, which is wide enough to perform the operation. So how does this ""worm"" manage to drill around curves and corners through the mastoid bone? ""The worm consists of a 'head' and a 'tail' section,"" explains Karstensen. ""Both of these parts are connected with one another by means of a flexible bellows mechanism."" The design is reminiscent of an articulated public transit bus in which the front and rear sections are coupled by means of a hose-like center section that looks like an accordion. As it travels through the bone, the robot is connected to the ""outside world"" -- in other words the control units and pumps in the operation room -- by means of 8 to 12 hydraulic lines. It is these lines that allow the robot to crawl forward in the right direction. This is done by first pumping hydraulic fluid into three bladders found in the rear section of the robot. The bladders fill in the empty space between the worm and the bone and thereby fix the rear section of the robot in place. The hydraulic fluid then travels into the bellows. This causes the ""accordion"" to expand, which pushes the head forward. The worm stretches, so to speak, and presses its front section further into the bone. The drill attached to the head bores deeper inward. Now the rear section retracts towards the head in a motion similar to that of a real worm. To do so, the bladders in the front section are pumped full of fluid to hold the front in place while the fluid in the rear bladders is evacuated. At this point the fluid is also being sucked out of the bellows through the hydraulic lines. The robot contracts, which pulls the rear section up behind the front. In this way the NiLiBoRo makes its way forward bit by bit. ""We can alter the robot's direction of travel by adjusting the bladders in the front section. For instance, if we wanted to move left then we fill the left bladder with less fluid than the right, which will cause the robot to veer to the left,"" says Karstensen. In the laboratory, and later in the operation room, the path the NiLiBoRo takes as it drills its way forward is precisely monitored by an electromagnetic tracking system, or EMT for short. Designed by partners at the Technical University of Darmstadt, this system works by sporadically capturing images of the robot using computer tomography in order to monitor its position. Researchers have already constructed an initial prototype of the NiLiBoRo, which is currently five times larger than the planned final version. Right now it is composed of only the forward section together with the heart of the machine, the bellows. The developers plan to continue optimizing and expanding the prototype piece by piece. Once all the technology has been developed, the NiLiBoRo will be shrunk down to its final size. Researchers hope to have the miniature robot ready for testing by physicians in two years.

""It was questioned by many paleontologists, who thought and in fact some claimed in print that maybe it was just an artifact or a one-off, implausible fossilization event,"" said Strausfeld, a Regents' professor in the University of Arizona (UA)'s Department of Neuroscience. His latest paper in Current Biology addresses these doubts head-on, with definitive evidence that, indeed, brains do fossilize. An elemental scan of this fossil uncovered that carbon (in pink) and iron (in green) do not overlap in the preserved neural tissue. Credit: Strausfeld et al. and Current Biology  In the paper, Strausfeld and his collaborators, including Xiaoya Ma of Yunnan Key Laboratory for Palaeobiology at China's Yunnan University and Gregory Edgecombe of the Natural History Museum in London, analyze seven newly discovered fossils of the same species to find, in each, traces of what was undoubtedly a brain. The species, Fuxianhuia protensa, is an extinct arthropod that roamed the seafloor about 520 million years ago. It would have looked something like a very simple shrimp. And each of the fossils - from the Chengjiang Shales, fossil-rich sites in Southwest China revealed F. protensa's ancient brain looked a lot like a modern crustacean's, too. Using scanning electron microscopy, the researchers found that the brains were preserved as flattened carbon films, which, in some fossils, were partially overlaid by tiny iron pyrite crystals. This led the research team to a convincing explanation as to how and why neural tissue fossilizes. In another recent paper in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, Strausfeld's experiments uncovered what it likely was about ancient environmental conditions that allowed a brain to fossilize in the first place. The only way to become fossilized is, first, to get rapidly buried. Hungry scavengers can't eat a carcass if it's buried, and as long as the water is anoxic enough that is, lacking in oxygen a buried creature's tissues evade consumption by bacteria as well. Strausfeld and his collaborators suspect F. protensa was buried by rapid, underwater mudslides, a scenario they experimentally recreated by burying sandworms and cockroaches in mud. This is only step one. Step two, explained Strausfeld, is where most brains would fail: Withstanding the pressure from being rapidly buried under thick, heavy mud. To have been able to do this, the F. protensa nervous system must have been remarkably dense. In fact, tissues of nervous systems, including brains, are densest in living arthropods. As a small, tightly packed cellular network of fats and proteins, the brain and central nervous system could pass step two, just as did the sandworm and cockroach brains in Strausfeld's lab. ""Dewatering is different from dehydration, and it happens more gradually,"" said Strausfeld, referring to the process by which pressure from the overlying mud squeezes water out of tissues.

We have a way of marking and copying DNA damage sites so that we can preserve the information of where and what the damage was.  Jan Riedl, a University of Utah postdoctoral fellow and the study s first author, says 99 percent of DNA lesions   damage to the chemical bases known as A, C, G and T that help form the DNA double helix   are repaired naturally. The rest can lead to genetic mutations, which are errors in the sequence of bases and can cause disease. The new method can  identify and detect the position of lesions that lead to diseases,  he says. Burrows says:  We are trying to look for the chemical changes in the base that can lead the cell to make a mistake, a mutation. One of the powerful things about our method is we can read more than a single damaged site [and up to dozens] on the same strand of DNA.  The chemists say their new method will let researchers study chemical details of DNA lesions or damage. Such lesions, if not repaired naturally, accumulate over time and can lead to mutations responsible for many age-related diseases, including colon, breast, liver, lung and melanoma skin cancers; clogged arteries; and neurological ailments such as Huntington s disease and Lou Gehrig s disease.  A method capable of identifying the chemical identity and location in which lesions appear is crucial for determining the molecular etiology [cause] of these diseases,  Burrows and colleague write in their study. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Burrows and Riedl conducted the study with University of Utah chemists Aaron Fleming, a research assistant professor, and Yun Ding, a postdoctoral researcher. Method detects DNA damage that can lead to disease DNA is a molecule, shaped like a double-stranded helix that contains the genetic instructions that living organisms use to develop, function and reproduce. Each strand is made of numerous copies of four chemical bases   A, C, G and T   linked by a backbone of sugar and phosphate. When two strands are connected in a double helix, only two kinds of base pairs can form C-G (or G-C) and A-T (or T-A). The new method for finding DNA lesions combines other, existing techniques. First, the researchers find the damage and cut it out of the DNA the same way a cell does naturally, using what is called  base excision repair,  the discovery of which won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry this year for Tomas Lindahl, a scientist in England. Second, an  unnatural base pair  is inserted at the snipped-out DNA damage site to label it. Instead of natural base pairs C-G and A-T, the Utah chemists used a so-called third or unnatural base pair invented by chemists at the Scripps Research Institute in California. Burrows says her study demonstrates the first practical use of that invention. Third, the DNA with the damage site labeled by an unnatural third base pair is then amplified or copied millions of times using a well-known existing method called PCR, or polymerase chain reaction. Burrows says the new study s key innovation was to use base excision repair to snip out the damage and then to insert the unnatural base pair at the damage site, making it possible to make millions of copies of the DNA   a process that normally would be prevented by the damage. Fourth, another chemical label, named 18-crown-6 ether, is affixed to the unnatural base pair on all the DNA strands, which are then read or sequenced using a kind of nanopore sequencing developed a few years ago by Burrows and Utah chemist Henry White. Such sequencing involves determining the order and location of bases on a DNA strand   including damage sites labeled by unnatural bases   by passing the strand through a molecule-size pore or nanopore. People are born with their genome or genetic blueprint of 3 billion base pairs,  and then stuff happens,  Burrows says.  There s damage from oxidative stress due to inflammation and infection, too much metabolism, or environmental chemicals.  The new method seeks  molecular details that define how our genome responds to what we eat and the air we breathe, and ends up being healthy or not,  she says. DNA lesions happen more than 10,000 times a day in a single human cell. A lesion can be a missing base, a base that has changed chemically or a break in the DNA backbone. That many lesions may seem like a lot, but with 3 billion base pairs in the genome of a single cell, the damage only affects about one of every 300,000 base pairs. Details of the study The chemists tested their method on a gene named KRAS that, when mutated, can cause lung or breast cancer. Burrows says most DNA sequencing methods reveal mutations because the methods read the bases A, C, G and T. When sequencing reveals one of those bases out of place, that is a mutation.  However, what you don t know is what chemistry   what modification   caused that mutation,  she says, But scientists can t find a single strand of DNA in a solution in a reasonable time. They need to make millions to billions of copies of the DNA so they can sequence it and locate the gap where the damage was. But the damage itself is  a train wreck  that either prevents making copies of the DNA or makes copies with errors, Burrows says. So once the damaged base has been excised to create a gap, the chemists insert the third or unnatural base pair at then damage site as a way to label it while at the same time allowing millions of copies of the labeled DNA to be made. Burrows says the key innovation in the new method is using base excision repair and unnatural base pairs  to copy the DNA and retain the information about damage that was in the original molecule.  The chemists next use PCR amplification to make millions of copies of the DNA by heating it until strands in the double helix separate. The strands are put in a solution with lots of A, C, G and T nucleotides   the bases attached to pieces of DNA backbone. A polymerase enzyme is attached to the end of each strand of DNA, and then moves along the strand grabbing T, G, C and A nucleotides to make a second strand. Each DNA strand quickly becomes two. The number of strands reaches the millions in hours.  We need that many because, if we just have one molecule, we can t find it,  Burrows says.  It s like saying,  There s one fish in that pond; try to catch it.  But if there are a bunch of identical fish, you can catch any one of them and still have dinner.  Once the chemists have millions of DNA strands with the damage labeled by an unnatural base pair, they then use nanopore sequencing to locate the damage. Burrows says to imagine the DNA strand is a long piece of yarn with a number of knots tied in it to represent labeled DNA lesions. Grab one end of the yarn with one hand, and pull it through a couple of fingers on the other hand. The fingers represent the nanopore that detects the knots or damage as they pass between the fingers. To do nanopore sequencing, the DNA s damage sites, which are labeled with unnatural bases, are labeled again with a chemical named 18-crown-6 ether that basically makes the  knots  on the DNA  yarn  bigger and easier to find as the DNA strand moves through a pore-shaped protein bathed in electrically charged fluid. Changes in electric current allow chemists detect the bases A, C, G and T and the labeled unnatural bases. Finding the labeled unnatural bases identifies the DNA damage site to within 10 base pairs. Burrows says the nanopore sequencing method needs improvement or replacement by next-generation sequencing to actually pinpoint the damage sites.","Published: November 9, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-way-to-help-skin-heal-faster-203122,New Way to Help Skin Heal Faster Researchers have discovered a new way to prevent inflammation and to speed up the skin s healing process   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Most products on the market today that are used to treat skin problems target the effects of the disease or wound such as inflammation, which can prolong the healing process and result in scarring. However, LSU Assistant Professor Wei Xu and collaborators at Northwestern University discovered a new way to prevent inflammation and to speed up the skin s healing process. After five years of research, they identified the gene regulation pathway, which involves the body s sodium sensor called Nax (scn7a) that triggers inflammation. They found a way to block it using a nanoparticle-carried small interference RNA, which enables the skin to heal faster.  This is a really novel pathway we identified. Nobody has ever tried to develop a product that gets at this pathway before,  said Wei Xu, assistant professor at the LSU AgCenter and the School of Renewable Natural Resources. Xu and his colleagues developed a nanoparticle that delivers the RNA that inhibits Nax preventing inflammation. The nanoparticle can be applied to the skin in a cream or lotion.   I think this is going to be very promising in skin disease treatments,  Xu said. This discovery was built upon Xu s post-doctoral research adviser, Dr. Thomas Mustoe s work that showed areas of skin with high hydration heal faster. Combined with the fact that human skin holds more than 100 times as much sodium than most other ions, led the researchers to believe that the body s sodium regulators were key components. One sodium channel, Nax, is particularly sensitive to the body s changes in salt concentration. In previous studies, Nax has been shown to also regulate sodium levels in the central nervous system. Xu applied the DNA microarray technique to screen more than 100,000 genes in the human genome to find the exact gene regulation pathway.  If we target the very beginning of the pathway, we can control the expression levels of the inflammation factors,  he said.","Published: November 9, 2015"

Roy is a professor in the Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences in the Schools of Pharmacy and Medicine, and technical director of The Kidney Project at UCSF, a multi-institutional collaboration. The Kidney Project team has prototyped and begun testing key components of the coffee-cup-sized device, which mimics functions of the human kidney.   NIBIB is overseeing and funding the continuation of their work for four years under a cooperative agreement through its Quantum Program, created to support the development of  biomedical technologies that will result in a profound paradigm shift in prevention, detection, diagnosis, and/or treatment of a major disease or national public health problem.  This is the second major grant the researchers have received through the program. Alternative to dialysis In part because the U.S. population has grown older and heavier and is more likely to develop high blood pressure and diabetes, conditions often associated with kidney failure, the number of individuals diagnosed with kidney failure is growing year-over-year and has risen 57 percent since 2000, according to the National Kidney Foundation. More than 615,000 people now are being treated for kidney failure. U.S. government statistics indicate that kidney failure costs the U.S. health care system $40 billion annually and accounts for more than 6 percent of Medicare spending. The waiting list for kidney transplants in the United States has grown to more than 100,000 people. The number of available kidneys has remained stagnant for the past decade, and only about one in five now on the list is expected to receive a transplant. More than 430,000 of those with kidney failure now undergo dialysis, which is more costly and less effective than transplantation and typically requires hours-long stays at a clinic, three times weekly. Only about one in three patients who begins dialysis survives longer than five years, in comparison to more than four in five transplant recipients. Fissell, associate professor in the Department of Medicine at Vanderbilt and medical director for The Kidney Project, said,  This project is about creating a permanent solution to the scarcity problem in organ transplantation. We are increasing the options for people with chronic kidney disease who would otherwise be forced onto dialysis.  Along with Roy at UCSF and Fissell at Vanderbilt, a national team of scientists and engineers at universities and small businesses are working toward making the implantable artificial kidney available to patients. According to B. Joseph Guglielmo, PharmD, dean of the UCSF School of Pharmacy, ""The grant from NIBIB is a striking affirmation of the promise associated with this device, as well as NIH confidence in the ultimate success of The Kidney Project. Patients with chronic kidney failure are in real need of alternatives to transplant and dialysis; this School of Pharmacy and campus priority clearly demonstrates the research rewards of working collaboratively."" In September the project was designated for inclusion in the FDA s new Expedited Access Pathway program to speed development, evaluation, and review of medical devices that meet major unmet needs in fighting life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases. The program evolved from an earlier FDA program called Innovation Pathway 2.0, in which The Kidney Project team was one of three device-development groups selected for a pilot initiative focused on kidney failure. Members of the FDA regulatory staff have continually been in communication with Roy and other project leaders to help guide device testing and criteria for data collection. The aim of the new program is to speed the FDA s premarket approval (PMA) process for scientific and regulatory review of safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices   those with the potential to provide major benefits, but that also might potentially pose major risks.  The new program brings FDA reviewers, scientists, and leadership together with our team to define a roadmap to regulatory approval and product launch,  Roy said. Early studies of prototype are encouraging One component of the new artificial kidney is a silicon nanofilter to remove toxins, salts, some small molecules, and water from the blood. Roy s research team designed it based on manufacturing methods used in the production of semiconductor electronics and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The new silicon nanofilters offer several advantages   including more uniform pore size   over filters now used in dialysis machines, according to Roy. The silicon nanofilter is designed to function on blood pressure alone and without a pump or electrical power. The second major component is a  bioreactor  that contains human kidney tubule cells embedded within microscopic scaffolding. These cells perform metabolic functions and reabsorb water from the filtrate to control blood volume. A project collaborator, H. David Humes, MD, professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Michigan, earlier showed that such a bioreactor, used in combination with ultrafiltration in an external device, greatly increased survival in comparison to dialysis alone in the treatment of patients with acute kidney failure in a hospital intensive care unit. The artificial kidney being developed by Roy and Fissell is designed to be connected internally to the patient s blood supply and bladder and implanted near the patient s own kidneys, which are not removed. Unlike human kidney transplant recipients, patients with the implantable artificial kidney will not require immunosuppressive therapy, according to Roy. Preliminary preclinical studies indicate that the non-reactive coatings developed for device components are unlikely to lead to filter clogging or immune reactions, he said, and that bioreactor cells can survive for at least 60 days under simulated physiological conditions. About one-half of the new funding from NIBIB will support lab studies on methods for optimizing performance of the bioreactor s kidney cells. The remainder will enable refinements for the mechanical design of the nanofilter unit and biocompatibility of the artificial kidney. The filter will be evaluated in preclinical studies aimed at achieving clot-free operation and stable filtration for 30 days. Private philanthropy and UCSF support already have been vital in sustaining The Kidney Project, and even with the FDA s new and more flexible pathway, additional funding will be required to meet project timelines, Roy said.","Published: November 9, 2015"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/some-3d-printed-objects-are-toxic-209792,Some   D Printed Objects Are Toxic Researchers at the University of California  Riverside have found parts produced by some commercial   D printers are toxic to certain fish embryos   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.  These 3-D printers are like tiny factories in a box,  said William Grover, an assistant professor of bioengineering in the Bourns College of Engineering.  We regulate factories. We would never bring one into our home. Yet, we are starting to bring these 3-D printers into our homes like they are toasters.  The researchers studied two common types of 3-D printers: one that melts plastic to build a part, and another that uses light to turn a liquid into a solid part. They found that parts from both types of printers were measurably toxic to zebrafish embryos, and parts from the liquid-based printer were the most toxic. They also developed a simple post-printing treatment   exposure to ultraviolet light   that reduced the toxicity of parts from the liquid-based printer. Growing popularity The research comes as the popularity of 3-D printers is soaring. The value of the 3-D printing market grew from $288 million in 2012 to $2.5 billion in 2013 and is projected to grow to $16.2 billion by 2018, according to a report by Canalys. And, as the price of 3-D printers continues to drop   printers that use melted plastic are currently available for as little as $200, and the liquid-based printer used in this study can be bought for less than $3,000   they are moving beyond industry and research labs to homes and small businesses. The research started about a year ago when Grover bought a 3-D printer for his lab. Shirin Mesbah Oskui, a graduate student in Grover s lab, is developing tools for studying zebrafish embryos, and she wanted to use the printer in her research. However, her plans were thwarted when she noticed that zebrafish embryos die after exposure to parts from the 3-D printer. From those observations, Oskui and Grover then decided to test the toxicity of printed objects from the two types of 3-D printers. Their results are described in a paper,  Assessing and Reducing the Toxicity of 3D-Printed Parts,  which was published online today (Nov. 4) in the journal Environmental Science and Technology Letters. Joining Oskui and Grover as authors on the paper are Jay Gan and Daniel Schlenk, professors in the Department of Environmental Sciences; Graciel Diamante, a graduate student working with Schlenk; and Chunyang Liao and Wei Shi, both of whom work in Gan s lab. Oskui used two commercial 3-D printers in their study, a Dimension Elite printer made by Stratasys (which uses melted plastic to build parts) and a Form 1+ stereolithography printer made by Formlabs (which uses liquid resin to make parts). She used each printer to create disc-shaped parts, about an inch in diameter. Then she placed the discs in petri dishes with zebrafish embryos and studied survival rates and hatch rates and monitored for developmental abnormalities. While the embryos exposed to parts from the plastic-melting printer had slightly decreased average survival rates compared to control embryos, the embryos exposed to parts from the liquid-resin printer had significantly decreased survival rates, with more than half of the embryos dead by day three and all dead by day seven. And of the few zebrafish embryos that hatched after exposure to parts from the liquid-resin printer, 100 percent of the hatchlings had developmental abnormalities. Oskui also investigated methods for reducing the toxicity of parts from the liquid-resin printer. She found that after exposing the parts to ultraviolet light for one hour, the parts are significantly less toxic to zebrafish embryos. The UC Riverside Office of Technology Commercialization has filed a patent for this work. Eye on regulations The researchers  findings call attention to regulations related to the materials used to create 3-D printed parts. The substances used to create the 3-D-printed parts would be regulated by the Toxic Substances Control Act, which is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency. But the precise identity of these substances is often unknown to researchers and printer users because the printer manufacturers don t disclose this information. In the future, the researchers plan to further study the toxicity of the components of the 3-D printer material both individually and when mixed together in a completed part. They also want to find out at what level the material could be harmful to humans. Other unanswered questions include how to dispose of the waste material   both solid and liquid   created by 3-D printers. At this point, the researchers think it is best to take it to a hazardous waste center.  Many people, including myself, are excited about 3-D printing,  Grover said.  But, we really need to take a step back and ask, how safe are these materials? ","Published: November 9, 2015"

Using similar tools to Systems Biology, Systems Serology is a combined experimental and computational analytical method that effectively teases out the complex immune response needed for an effective HIV vaccine. Dr Chung, the first author of the study, who helped develop the approach while working with Associate Professor Galit Alter at the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard and Professor Douglas Lauffenburger at MIT as part of her American Australian Association and National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Early Career Fellowships, said the technique provided an unprecedented depth of understanding to these potentially protective immune responses.  Antibodies are a key part of protection against viruses like HIV. They can harness a variety of different  weapons  to eliminate virus,  she said,  But the exact immune responses or combinations to induce protective immunity against HIV are still unclear.  Using Systems Serology we revealed unique, vaccine-induced antibody  fingerprints , which highlighted known and novel markers of what is needed to protect a person from becoming infected with HIV.  Approximately 34 million people have died due to HIV-related causes worldwide. By the end of 2014, there were an estimated 36.9 million people living with HIV globally, with approximately two million people becoming newly infected with the virus1. Director of the Doherty Institute and a world leader in research and clinical management of HIV, University of Melbourne Professor Sharon Lewin, said creating an effective vaccine would be the only cheap and scalable way to prevent HIV infection on a global level.  Although we now have multiple emerging and highly effective ways to prevent HIV infection through the use of antivirals, including pre exposure prophylaxis or PREP, an effective vaccine is still a top priority,  she said.  The development of Systems Serology is a major step forward in analysing vaccine- effectiveness and could certainly lead to identifying the exact combination of immune responses required to eliminate HIV transmission through vaccination.  What s more, this new analytical approach could also be applied to a multitude of other infectious diseases including Ebola and Mycobacterium Tuberculosis to help evaluate future antibody-based vaccines. We are delighted Amy chose to return to the Doherty Institute to continue this exciting work. ","Published: November 9, 2015"

The study is being conducted by researchers from IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Pompeu Fabra University, and the company Chemotargets, within the framework of the European eTOX project. Most computer tools employed today to detect possible adverse effects of compounds that are candidates for new medicines are based on detecting labile fragments in the drug's structure. These fragments can potentially transform to form reactive metabolites, which can have toxic properties. This is what is known as idiosyncratic toxicity and is a big headache for the pharmaceutical industry, as it tends to be detected in late development stages of the drug and even when it is already on the market, often causing the drug to be withdrawn. Jordi Mestres, coordinator of the IMIM and UPF research group on Systems Pharmacology at the Biomedical Informatics Program (GRIB) states  With this study we have contributed to complementing the detection of these quite unstable fragments, with information on the mechanism of action of the drug, based on three aspects: similarity to other medicines, prediction of their pharmacological profile, and interference with specific biological pathways. The optimal integration of these four aspects results in a clear improvement of our ability to anticipate adverse effects with higher confidence, which entails an extremely positive impact on society . In Europe, nearly 200,000 people die every year from adverse drug reactions, seven times more than in traffic accidents. An estimated 5% of hospitalisations are due to adverse effects and they are the fifth most common cause of hospital death. In addition, elderly people tend to take more than one drug at the same time, which multiplies the chances of suffering from adverse effects due to potential drug-drug interactions. In an increasingly ageing society, this problem is becoming much more serious. The human and financial costs of adverse effects are very high. That is why the discovery of new medicines is increasingly focused more on predicting possible adverse effects at the initial stages of developing a new drug. This work hopes to contribute to setting the path toward a new generation of more reliable computational tools with regard to predicting the adverse effects of therapeutically-relevant small molecules. Advancing large-scale predictive safety at the pre-clinical phase is now becoming closer than ever, with expectations to lead to safer drugs for the entire population.","Published: November 9, 2015"

The immunologists were able to develop a model vaccine, which targeted these 'T-helper type 1' cells, and then showed experimentally that its use led to improved infection outcomes. Assistant Professor in Immunology at Trinity, Dr Rachel McLoughlin, said: ""To design an effective vaccine it is imperative you know how a bacterium interacts with its host. By screening patients with Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infections we were able to isolate key players in the immune system that dealt with these infections and then designed a model vaccine that effectively sparked them into action."" The World Health Organisation (WHO) warns of an impending ""post-antibiotic era,"" with the potential to undermine modern medicine. Anti-microbial resistance is a global crisis that demands the development of new antimicrobials, but developing alternatives to antibiotics such as vaccines would prevent infection in the first place. The bacterium S. aureus is a major cause of healthcare-associated infections, and blood stream infections caused by S. aureus are associated with significant mortality. Resistance in S. aureus to the main antibiotic used for treatment, methicillin, was first reported in the 1960s and, over the past decades, antibiotic resistant S. aureus, or MRSA, has become endemic in hospitals throughout the world. To date, around eight promising candidate vaccines have failed in clinical trials, despite showing promise in pre-clinical models. Traditional approaches to vaccine development have thus failed to develop an effective weapon against MRSA. We now know that cellular immunity (involving 'T-cells') is vitally important in protection against S. aureus infection, because individual T-cell subsets are very important for activating phagocytes - the immune cells that ingest and kill bacteria. Dr McLoughlin and her colleagues found that 'T-helper type 1 cells' were elevated in patients following S. aureus infection. Their model vaccine, which jolted these cells into action, improved infection outcomes. The results therefore support the design of vaccines that specifically target these cells in humans. Dr McLoughlin said: ""This study demonstrates the importance of truly translational research. Using pre-clinical models we identified an immune mechanism important for protection against S. aureus infection, but it was via collaboration with clinicians at three Dublin teaching hospitals that we were able to translate these findings to show the same mechanism of immunity is relevant in human infection. Our findings will directly inform the design of next-gen anti S. aureus vaccines and could significantly increase our chances of realizing an effective vaccine to protect patients from MRSA.""","Published: November 9, 2015"

Their research, which started more than a decade ago and has been part-funded by Cancer Research UK, has explored the pliability of the protein and how its ability to shape-shift dictates its function. Principal Investigator Tim Elliott, Professor of Experimental Oncology and Deputy Director for the IfLS, said:  This protein acts as a molecular interface between your body and your immune system. It alerts your immune system to the fact that the body has been infected by a virus or invaded by cancer, and guides white blood cells to kill them. What we have discovered is that it can only perform these vital functions if it is allowed to  wriggle  in a particular way. We also discovered that, because it is a pliable molecule, different parts of the protein communicate with one another   if we touch it in one place, the function in a distant part of the molecule changes. These findings are of real interest to both immunologists who are developing new immunotherapies for diseases and biology as a whole. They have generated real interest in the healthcare industry.  The team s discoveries could have a major impact on the future of medical treatment and in the long term could see the development of cancer immunotherapies and vaccines against infection. It could also help to reduce allergies such as contact hypersensitivity by understanding how the additives used in healthcare products are detected by the immune system. The results of the study have led to the award of significant industry funding from the consumer goods giant Unilever. It has awarded the team  700,000 to work in collaboration with its scientists to continue exploring ways to minimise allergic reactions, involving MHC1, to additives in healthcare products. Professor Elliott said:  This is fantastic news. It is a strong indication of the quality of our research that consumer companies such as Unilever are interested in the fundamental science that we are exploring and can see the potential applications for industry even if they are still a long way ahead.

One micron is equal to about 1/100th the width of a human hair. Results of the work have recently been published by postdoctoral associate Jack Cahill and Gary Van Berkel and Vilmos Kertesz of ORNL s Chemical Sciences Division.  Knowing the chemical basis of material interactions that take place at interfaces is vital for designing and advancing new functional materials that are important for DOE missions such as organic photovoltaics for solar energy,  Van Berkel said.  In addition, the new tool can be used to better understand the chemical basis of important biological processes such as drug transport, disease progression and response for treatment. The hybrid instrument transfers tiny amounts of a material such as human tissue or an organic polymer from a sample by a laser ablation process in which material is captured and transported via liquid stream to the ionization source of the mass spectrometer. In just seconds, a computer screen displays the results. Researchers noted that the resolution of less than one micron is essential to accurately differentiate and distinguish between polymers and sub-components of similar-sized cells.  Today s mass spectrometry imaging techniques are not yet up to the task of reliably acquiring molecular information on a wide range of compound types,  Cahill said.

The gains were comparable to treatment with anti-cancer drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-L1 antibodies. The combination of oral doses of the bacteria and injections with anti-PD-L1 antibody nearly abolished tumor outgrowth, the researchers report online Thursday in the journal Science. ""Our results clearly demonstrate a significant, although unexpected, role for specific gut bacteria in enhancing the immune system's response to melanoma and possibly many other tumor types,"" said study director Thomas Gajewski, MD, PhD, professor of medicine and pathology at the University of Chicago. ""The field has recently recognized close connections between the gut microbiome and the immune system,"" he said. ""This finding provides a novel way to exploit that connection, to improve immunotherapy by selectively modulating intestinal bacteria."" Checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab have had a dramatic impact on treatment of several tumor types, including melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancers and others. But only a minority of patients one-third or less have a vigorous response. Cancer researchers have wondered why so few benefit. Gajewski and colleagues found a similar pattern in the mice they use for cancer research. They noticed that mice purchased from Jackson Laboratory (JAX) tended to have a robust spontaneous immune response to small melanoma tumors implanted under their skin. Mice from Taconic Biosciences (TAC) showed only a weak immune response. But when the researchers put the mice from both sources in cages together for three weeks, they found that co-housing ""completely abolished the differences in tumor growth,"" Gajewski said. This made them suspect that by sharing exposure to various types of bacteria, the TAC mice had acquired microbes from JAX mice that somehow enhanced their immunity to tumors. They confirmed their suspicion by collecting fecal matter from JAX mice and transferring it into the stomachs of TAC mice. It worked. Treated TAC mice were then able to mount a strong immune response and delay tumor growth. The reverse process, transferring fecal bacteria from TAC to JAX mice had no effect. Next, they compared the effects of bacterial transfer against a checkpoint inhibitor, anti-PD-L1 antibodies. They found that introducing the bacteria was just as effective as treating them with anti-PD-L1 antibodies, resulting in significantly slower tumor growth. Combining the benefits associated with the bacteria with anti-PD-L1 treatment dramatically improved tumor control. So they began searching for the specific bacteria that made the difference. They identified microbes from the digestive tracts of JAX and TAC mice by large-scale sequencing. Although there were significant differences in 254 taxonomic families of bacteria from the two sets of mice, three groups were prominent. When they tested the effects of each group on the mice's immune systems, one group, the Bifidobacterium, stood out. Within two weeks of oral administration, TAC mice that received just Bifidobacterium species had a marked increase in the anti-tumor T cell responses. Mice treated just with Bifidobacterium, rather than the full fecal transfer, displayed tumor control comparable to those who received the full mixture. The effect was long-lasting. TAC mice exposed to tumors as late as six weeks after the Bifidobacterium transfer were still able to mount a robust immune response. Additional tests showed that the Bifidobacterium did not leave the intestine. They appeared to trigger the immune response by interacting with roaming dendritic cells. These scavenger cells detect and process potential threats and present them to the T cells. The researchers suspect that Bifidobacterium colonize a compartment in the intestines. This enables them to interact with the cells that interact with dendritic cells, which activate tumor-killing T cells. There may be other bacteria that also contribute to this process, the researchers note, either positively or negatively. They are investigating bacteria that could influence other immune therapies, such at the CTLA-4 pathway, exploited by ipilimumab. A second study from the Institut Gustave Roussy in Paris, published in the same issue of Science found that antibiotics could disrupt the antitumor effects of ipilimumab. Replenishing lost microbes in germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice restored the drug's anti-cancer effects.","Published: November 9, 2015"

She is now cancer free and doing well. This breakthrough comes from GOSH and UCL Institute of Child Health s (ICH) pioneering research teams, who together are developing treatments and cures for some of the rarest childhood diseases.  Chemotherapy successfully treats many patients with leukaemia but it can be ineffective in patients with particularly aggressive forms of the disease where cancer cells can remain hidden or resistant to drug therapy. Recent developments have led to treatments where immune cells, known as T-cells, are gathered from patients and programmed using gene therapy to recognise and kill cancerous cells. Multiple clinical trials are underway, but individuals with leukaemia, or those who have had several rounds of chemotherapy, often don t have enough healthy T-cells to collect and modify meaning this type of treatment is not appropriate. A team at GOSH has now used modified T-cells from donors, known as UCART19 cells, to treat a one-year-old child with an aggressive form of ALL who had unsuccessful chemotherapy and for whom palliative care was deemed the only option left. The treatment works by adding new genes to healthy donor T-cells, which arm them against leukaemia. Using molecular tools (TALEN ) that act like very accurate scissors, specific genes are then cut in order to make the T-cells behave in two specific ways. Firstly, the cells became invisible to a powerful leukaemia drug that would usually kill them and secondly they are reprogrammed to only target and fight against leukaemia cells. The team at GOSH and the UCL ICH, along with investigators at University College London and biotech company Cellectis, had been developing  off-the-shelf  banks of these donor T-cells and the first of which was due to be used for final stage testing ahead of clinical trials. But, after hearing about this infant, the team received special permission to try the new treatment early. Professor Waseem Qasim, Professor of Cell and Gene Therapy at UCL ICH and Consultant Immunologist at GOSH, explains: ""The approach was looking incredibly successful in laboratory studies, and so when I heard there were no options left for treating this child s disease, I thought  why don t we use the new UCART19 cells?  ""The treatment was highly experimental and we had to get special permissions, but she appeared ideally suited for this type of approach."" The patient s parents were also keen to try the treatment. Mum, Lisa, says: ""We didn t want to accept palliative care and so we asked the doctors to try anything for our daughter, even if it hadn t been tried before."" The treatment consisted of 1ml of UCART19 cells delivered via intravenous line in around 10 minutes. After the cells had been delivered, the patient spent several months in isolation to protect her from infections while her immune system was extremely weak. Throughout this time, the patient stayed generally well. After several weeks there were signs that the treatment was working. Professor Paul Veys, Director of bone marrow transplant at GOSH and the patient s lead clinician, says: ""As this was the first time that the treatment had been used, we didn t know if or when it would work and so we were over the moon when it did. Her leukaemia was so aggressive that such a response is almost a miracle."" Once doctors were confident that the leukaemia cells had been removed, the patient was given a bone marrow transplant to replace her entire blood and immune system which had been wiped out by the treatment. The child is now recovering well at home, although she returns to GOSH regularly to check that her bone marrow cells are healthy and blood counts continuing to normalise. Professor Qasim says: ""We have only used this treatment on one very strong little girl, and we have to be cautious about claiming that this will be a suitable treatment option for all children. But, this is a landmark in the use of new gene engineering technology and the effects for this child have been staggering. ""If replicated, it could represent a huge step forward in treating leukaemia and other cancers."" Full clinical trials funded by Cellectis are now being planned to test UCART19 cells in larger groups of patients and are set to begin early in 2016.  Cellectis main objective is to provide cancer patients with an accessible, cost-effective, off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR-T therapies across all geographies. With clinical trial for the first gene-edited UCART on the horizon, it could be the beginning of a revolution in cancer immunotherapy,  says Dr. Andr  Choulika, Chairman and CEO of Cellectis. Layla's story Layla was born healthy at 7lb 10 in June 2014. There were no problems during pregnancy and when she was born she was happy and content. At three months old, Layla was taken to the doctors as she was off her milk crying lots and her heart beat was fast. At first doctors suspected a tummy bug but after a blood test a few days later, it was confirmed that Layla had Infant Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL.) Layla was just 14 weeks old. The family were immediately sent to GOSH in a CATS ambulance and Layla was taken to intensive care with what doctors described as ""one of the most aggressive forms of the disease we have ever seen."" The next day Layla was moved to Elephant Ward where chemotherapy started straight away. She had several rounds of treatment to try and get rid of the cancer and was then given a bone marrow transplant (BMT) so her damaged blood cells could be replaced. Seven weeks later the family were told that despite the transplant Layla s cancer had returned. As the strong doses of chemotherapy that Layla had already received hadn t killed off the cancer cells, a second round of treatment wasn t an option. After travelling to Sheffield and taking part in an experimental treatment that sadly didn t work for Layla, the family returned to London the day before her first birthday.  Doctors at GOSH explained that there were no treatment options left for Layla that would cure her and suggested palliative care. Mum, Lisa, says: ""Doctors don t want to say that there s nothing we can do and offer palliative care but sometimes that s the only option. ""We didn t want to accept palliative care and give up on our daughter though so we asked the doctors to try anything."" The family were then told that a very recent and experimental treatment, which had only been trialled in mice, was being developed in the hospital and could be used to try and treat the aggressive form of cancer that Layla had. Only one vial of the treatment was available for Layla but in order for that to be given, an emergency ethics committee meeting had to be called to discuss whether it was the right thing to do for her. Dad, Ashleigh, says: ""It was scary to think that the treatment had never been used in a human before but even with the risks, there was no doubt that we wanted to try the treatment. She was sick and in lots of pain so we had to do something. ""Doctors explained that even if we could try the treatment, there was no guarantee that it would work but we prayed it would."" After ethical approval was gained, doctors explained to mum and dad what the treatment would involve, consent forms were signed and treatment could begin. Treatment involved Layla being given a small 1ml infusion of genetically engineered cells through her Hickman line, which took a couple of minutes followed by a five minute flush. ""Layla didn t notice anything was going on, and was bouncing around her cot all the way through!"" Ashleigh says: ""We thought that the little bit of liquid in the syringe was nothing, and asked 'what is that going to do when bags and bags of chemo haven t worked.' The nurse said this was about quality and not quantity though."" Within one to two weeks doctors expected to see an immune response   usually in the form of a rash or a fever   to show that the treatment was working but when there was no change in Layla at two weeks, medical staff were unsure whether it had been successful. Doctors were preparing to send Layla home when she got  the rash . Something seemed to be happening. The rash got worse but aside from that Layla remained well. Lisa says: ""We didn t know she was going to be so well. We were preparing ourselves for her to be in intensive care and were constantly waiting to pull the crash bell. ""It was terrifying because you think that if she hasn t gone to intensive care then it s not working. When she didn t, we couldn t believe it."" A few weeks later, Lisa was picking up her elder daughter from school when Ashleigh called. ""He said that the consultants had been in with results of the treatment and told me to sit down. ""I thought it was bad news but then he said  it s worked  and I just cried happy tears.""   Around two months later and cancer free, Layla came back to GOSH for a second BMT to replace her bone marrow which had also been affected by the treatment. Her blood cell numbers increased from that point and one month after the transplant, she was well enough to go home. Ashleigh says: ""Even though she is well at the moment, we still don t know what the future holds. She will still have monthly bone marrow checks for now and might be on some medicines for the rest of her life. ""It s always at the back of your mind. It s not like chickenpox that clears away, this is constant. You always have doubts."" But Lisa says: ""I consider ourselves lucky that we were in the right place at the right time to get a vial of these cells. We always said that we had to try new things as we didn t want to be saying  what if? ""Hopefully Layla will stay well and lots more children can be helped with this new treatment.""","Published: November 9, 2015"

The initial phase of the project, which is being conducted in partnership with seven global leaders in genomic sequencing for clinical utility, as well as two informatics partners, will aggregate participants  clinical-grade sequencing data to improve patient treatment decisions and catalyze clinical and translational research. The seven founding members of the consortium and phase 1 participants are: The two informatics partners are: The need for AACR Project GENIE is great,  said Charles L. Sawyers, MD, AACR Project GENIE Steering Committee chairperson, 2015-2017.  Numerous factors are driving an increase in the amount of genomic data available for analysis; however, these data are typically insufficient in number or lack the necessary clinical outcomes data to be clinically meaningful. Thus, to effectively benefit patients, the genomic and clinical outcomes data from as many institutions as is practical should be combined through a data-sharing initiative, such as AACR Project GENIE.  AACR Project GENIE will accomplish its goals by pooling existing and ongoing Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)- and International Organization for Standardization (ISO)-certified sequencing data from the participating institutions into a single registry and linking these data with select longitudinal clinical outcomes [see infographic (PDF)]. All project data will be made open-access following defined periods of project exclusivity, and the initial genomic data set will be publicly available on Nov. 6, 2016. The AACR Project GENIE registry already contains more than 17,000 genomic records. This registry is unique in that it is enriched in late-stage cancers and contains only clinical-grade sequencing data on which clinical decisions have been made. More importantly, the number of genomic records in the AACR Project GENIE registry will continue to grow as new patients are seen at each participating institution and subsequently added to the registry. The approach to data harmonization is such that each participating organization can continue to operate how it best sees fit while simultaneously contributing its data to the project. In this manner, future participants can and will be easily added once the pilot phase of the project is concluded.  Data-sharing projects are crucial because they connect data producers, mainly doctors from hospitals, and data analysts who are bioinformaticians and biologists,  said Fabrice Andr , MD, PhD, professor, Institut Gustave Roussy, and AACR Project GENIE Steering Committee member.  The beauty of data-sharing projects is that they are universal and allow anyone in the world to work on biology projects based on a common data set. This is extremely exciting for a medical doctor to run projects that will serve the community of researchers across the world. AACR Project GENIE is a unique resource that will accomplish this.  The AACR Project GENIE registry is a tool that can be used to solve a multitude of clinical and research challenges. There are myriad ways in which the project can benefit patients, including: the validation of gene signatures of drug response or prognosis; the ability to identify new patient populations for previously U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs; the expansion of patient populations that will benefit from existing drugs; and the identification of new drug targets and biomarkers.  I am extremely proud that the AACR is serving as the coordinating center for AACR Project GENIE,  said Margaret Foti, PhD, MD (hc), chief executive officer of the AACR.  As a highly respected scientific, not-for-profit international organization, the AACR is uniquely suited to play such a critical role in this important precedent-setting project. We will also be marshaling the collective wisdom of our membership, as well as leveraging our close relationships with the FDA, the National Cancer Institute, and the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, to ensure the success of the project for the benefit of cancer patients everywhere.

From transcription to function: mapping brain networks The brain is a series of connected functional networks which coordinate the control of processes like vision and language. Mapping the molecular networks that underlie this connectivity would provide an unprecedented understanding of brain function in health and disease. However, significant technical challenges hinder our ability to study functional and molecular circuits simultaneously one approach requires an intact brain while the other requires sampling throughout all brain regions. To circumvent these major limitations Richiardi et al. approached the challenge by correlating and mapping two fundamentally distinct circuits in the cortex: gene transcription networks and functional networks.   Hypersexual disorder linked to overactive stress systems New research from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden shows that hypersexual disorder known popularly as sex addiction can be linked to hyperactive stress systems. In a stress regulation test using the cortisone drug dexamethasone, men with hypersexual disorder showed higher levels of stress hormones than controls, a finding that the researchers hope will contribute to improved therapy for this patient group. The results are published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology.   Righting a wrong? Right side of brain can compensate for post-stroke loss of speech After a debate that has lasted more than 130 years, researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center have found that loss of speech from a stroke in the left hemisphere of the brain can be recovered on the back, right side of the brain. This contradicts recent notions that the right hemisphere interferes with recovery. While the findings will likely not put an immediate end to the debate, they suggest a new direction in treatment.   Researchers: Alzheimer's is probably a collection of diseases that should be classified and treated separately Deciphering the mechanism that underlies the development of Alzheimer's disease in certain families but not in others, researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem s Faculty of Medicine have proposed that the malady is actually a collection of diseases that probably should be treated with a variety of different approaches.   Eye drops deliver gene therapy for brain disorders in NIH mouse study A research team including National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering-funded scientists has developed a simplified approach for delivering and monitoring gene therapy for brain disorders. The group used eye drops to deliver the gene for a growth factor called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in a mouse model of brain ischemia, which refers to a lack of blood and hence, oxygen, to the brain.

The extension was signed recently to develop multiple lead series targeting a non-disclosed G protein-coupled receptor to stop neuronal apoptosis. The collaboration started in December 2010 with the aim of discovering neuroprotective small molecules for the treatment of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s and Parkinson s, for which SynAging has unique scientific expertise and models. The joint lead optimization process of the collaboration extension aims to deliver orally active molecules for clinical development. SynAging has provided the target and relevant accompanying insights into disease biology and pharmacology to the collaboration and will participate in the upside of the project. Following joint target directed high-throughput screening and hit evaluation, the specificity and biological validation of lead compounds is performed in SynAging s phenotypic models. In contrast to most competing disease models, SynAging does not rely on transgenic models, but uses proprietary preparations of low number oligomers e.g. of amyloid beta peptides, to induce neurodegeneration. Compounds which prove positive in SynAging s in vitro phenotypic test system are validated for their on target activity and mode of action. Further validation is then performed in in vivo models at SynAging. Dr. Thierry Pillot, CEO of SynAging, said:  The current contract extension shows that SynAging has delivered on its promises and that Actelion agrees that the accomplishments justify further investment. The extension of the collaboration with Actelion will permit us to develop and test our ideas of novel targets and disease-fighting mechanisms.

The results will be presented at the 57th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, to be held December 5-8, 2015 in Orlando, Florida. Results showed that BL-8040, as a single agent and in combination with Cytarabine (Ara-C), was safe and well tolerated at all doses tested up to and including the highest dose level of 1.5 mg/kg, with no major adverse events. The composite complete remission rate, including both complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), was 38% in subjects receiving only one cycle of BL-8040 treatment at doses of 1 mg/kg and higher (n=16). Patients included in this part of the study were patients that had undergone a significant number of prior treatment cycles or that were refractory to induction treatment. Treatment with BL-8040 had a triple effect on the leukemic cells. First, following only two days of monotherapy, BL-8040 triggered an average 40-fold mobilization of immature AML progenitor cells from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood, thereby sensitizing these cells to the Ara-C chemotherapy and improving its efficacy. Second, BL-8040 showed a direct and significant apoptotic effect on the immature leukemia progenitor cells in the bone marrow following the two days of monotherapy. Last, BL-8040 induced leukemia progenitor cells towards differentiation, as evidenced by a 58% median decrease in the number of bone marrow leukemia progenitor cells, along with a three-fold increase in differentiated granulocytes, in the bone marrow biopsy conducted on Day 3 of the treatment cycle prior to the Ara-C treatment, as compared to the biopsy performed at baseline. Dr. Jorge Cortes, Chief of the AML and CML Sections at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, stated,  The clinical results from the dose escalation stage of the Phase 2 study for BL-8040 in r/r AML are very encouraging and fully support continued development of the compound in the AML space.  Dr. Kinneret Savitsky, CEO of BioLineRx, commented,  We are very pleased and encouraged by the positive results from the first part of this Phase 2 trial with BL-8040 for the treatment of r/r AML, especially in light of the severity of the patient population recruited and the short treatment regimen of one cycle. The results continue to demonstrate that BL-8040 not only significantly induces mobilization of leukemic cells from the protective microenvironment of the bone marrow into the peripheral blood, but also directly leads to apoptosis of leukemic progenitor cells and triggers terminal differentiation of the cells into granulocytes. Combined with the reported 38% remission rate from subjects receiving BL-8040 doses of at least 1 mg/kg, the results strongly suggest that BL-8040 has potent anti-leukemic activity and, in combination with Ara-C, may improve the response typically achieved in this advanced AML population.  Dr. Savitsky continued,  In light of the encouraging results, we look forward to discussions with the regulatory authorities regarding the future development plan for AML. We currently anticipate reporting topline results from the full study by early next year.   In order to further expand and enhance the potential of this unique oncology platform, we are continuing to perform and plan multiple additional clinical studies for BL-8040. These include a Phase 2b study which we recently initiated for BL-8040 as an AML consolidation treatment; a Phase 2 study in the planning stages as a novel stem cell mobilization treatment, based on input that we received from the FDA last month; and two additional studies in certain bone marrow failure indications and for the treatment of AML patients with the FLT3-ITD mutation,  concluded Dr. Savitsky.","Published: November 7, 2015"

The study, which appears in the journal ACS Nano, shows how the nanoparticle system targets the precise cells infected by the bacteria and maximizes the amount of drug delivered to those cells. Jeffrey Zink, distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry and a senior author on the study, developed the mesoporous silica nanoparticles used for drug delivery. Zink and his research team conducted an exhaustive process to find the best particle for the job.  The nanoparticles are full of deep empty pores,  Zink said.  We place the particles in drug solution overnight, filling the pores with drug molecules. We then block the pore openings on the nanoparticle s surface with molecules called nanovalves, sealing the drug inside the nanoparticle.  When the drug-bearing nanoparticles are injected into the infected animal, in this case a mouse, the drug stays in the nanoparticles until they reach their target: white blood cells called macrophages. Macrophages ingest nanoparticles into compartments that have an acidic environment. The nanovalves, which are designed to open in response to the more acidic surroundings, then release the drug.  We tested several different particles and nanovalves until we found the ones that would carry the maximum amount of drug and release it at just the right pH value,  Zink said. The F. tularensis bacterium is highly infectious and has been designated a top-tier bioterrorism agent by the Centers for Disease control, meaning that it is considered to pose a high risk to national security and public health.  F. tularensis survives and multiplies within macrophages, especially those in the liver, spleen and lung,  said Marcus Horwitz, a distinguished professor of medicine and microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics and the study s other senior author.  Macrophages readily devour mesoporous silica nanoparticles, making these particles ideal for treating these types of infections.  Moxifloxacin is a powerful treatment for tularemia, but it has side effects when administered as a free drug in the bloodstream. The UCLA researchers worked to maximize the efficacy of the treatment while reducing side effects.  When you give a drug freely in the blood, only 1 or 2 percent of it gets to where you want it to go,  Horwitz said.  With this system, the drug is contained inside the nanoparticles until they are inside macrophages, delivering a much larger amount of the drug directly to the site of infection.  Horwitz added that freely flowing drugs are metabolized and excreted from the moment they are administered, whereas nanoparticles protect drug molecules from metabolism and excretion until after their release in the target cells, making nanotherapeutics potentially very potent. The study compared the efficacy of freely injected moxifloxacin with that delivered by the controlled-release nanoparticles in mice. In mice given a highly lethal dose of Francisella tularensis, the nanoparticle-delivered moxifloxacin caused few side effects and was more effective at reducing the number of bacteria in the lungs than a dose of freely injected moxifloxacin two to four times greater. The nanoparticle delivery system has the potential to maximize antibiotic effectiveness and reduce side effects in other infectious diseases including tuberculosis, Q fever and Legionnaires  disease.","Published: November 7, 2015"

The DQSA was signed into law by President Obama on November 27, 2013 and created a new pathway, in which a compounding pharmacy can register with the FDA as an outsourcing facility. Once the Allen, Texas facility commences operations as an outsourcing facility, physicians, hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers will have the opportunity to prescribe and receive certain of Imprimis' proprietary compounded formulations with greater ease and without the time delays associated with the current requirement of providing patient-specific prescriptions and related shipping times. Imprimis' Texas facility is expected to be completed and dispensing certain prescriptions as an outsourcing facility on or before February 1, 2016. In the meantime, the pharmacy will continue its current operations without disruption of service during construction. Mark L. Baum, CEO of Imprimis stated, ""We believe this is the future for sterile compounding pharmacies and we have been advocates of the new law and increased FDA oversight to ensure public confidence in quality and patient safety. Fortunately, our Allen, Texas facility was a very good candidate for a low cost upgrade to a 503B outsourcing facility given the quality of the existing compounding infrastructure we recently purchased. We have begun renovations and purchased the equipment required for our Allen, Texas pharmacy to serve as an outsourcing facility at a cost of less than $200,000.

The certification enables ICON to offer iCardiac s Early Precision QT  services for evaluating the cardiac safety of new compounds in Phase I clinical trials. This solution provides clients with an earlier and more precise assessment of the safety risk of their drug and potentially eliminates the need for a separate Thorough QT (TQT) study in later stages of development. Commenting on the announcement, Steve Unwin, ICON s Executive Vice President, Early Phase Services, said:  We are looking to streamline the time and cost of early clinical development through our industry-leading technologies, agile and adaptive processes and by collaborating with industry partners who can bring new approaches to drug development. As an iCardiac Certified Site Partner, we can help our clients to assess the cardiac safety of their compounds earlier and more precisely which will enable them to prioritize clinical programs with strong safety profiles. In addition, more accurate early QT studies may eliminate the need for later stage TQT studies, saving our clients significant costs.  Since 2005, the FDA has required all new compounds in development to be tested for cardiac safety. A dedicated TQT study determines the compound s impact on the QT interval - the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave during the heart s electrical cycle. A prolonged QT interval indicates a potential safety risk for a new drug. TQT studies typically occur concurrently with Phase II or III trials however, the results of a prospective validation study, which was carried out in December 2014 through a collaboration between the FDA and Cardiac Safety Research Consortium, demonstrated that actionable cardiac safety assessments can be conducted in Phase I trials using ECGs collected during routine SAD or MAD studies. iCardiac Technologies  Early Precision QT methodology was used in the validation study, which ICON is now certified to offer in clients  SAD/MAD trials.  ICON and iCardiac have frequently worked together on QT assessment studies, and that working experience has repeatedly confirmed the strong expertise that ICON possesses in ensuring that cardiac safety data of the highest quality is acquired during their Phase I studies,  said Alex Zapesochny, President & CEO of iCardiac Technologies.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with ICON to bring the many benefits of Early Precision QT to their clients. ","Published: November 7, 2015"

Prognosis remains poor, however, for children diagnosed with a number of pediatric cancers, and many existing therapies are associated with long-term side effects that impact survivors' life expectancy and/or quality of life. Writing in the journal Science Translational Medicine, an international team of scientists from the Children's Cancer Institute-Australia (CCIA), Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) and Incuron LLC report significant progress toward addressing these persistent challenges. The CCIA's Daniel Carter, PhD, Glenn Marshall, MD, and co-authors report that they have identified a new treatment approach for a highly aggressive and usually fatal subtype of neuroblastoma, a cancer of nerve cells that is one of the most frequent solid tumors in children. The researchers provide evidence that the protein complex FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) represents a new and promising biomarker candidate and a target for treatment of this aggressive, treatment-resistant disease. They observe that a FACT-targeting drug candidate CBL0137, which was developed by the biotech company Incuron in collaboration with scientists from RPCI has demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of neuroblastoma. CBL0137 is a small molecule that belongs to a class of agents called curaxins, which were invented by a group that included paper co-author Andrei Gudkov, PhD, DSci, Senior Vice President for Basic Science at Roswell Park and founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Incuron. ""This work, which beautifully demonstrates the power of international collaboration of oncology researchers working both at academic centers and private enterprises, gives us hope that we will see improved cure rates and long-term outcomes for children afflicted with this aggressive disease,"" says Dr. Gudkov. ""We hope to soon be able to extend the opportunity to participate in clinical studies of curaxin CBL0137 to children with neuroblastoma, a prospect we eagerly await given the limited treatment options available currently."" While another target for this subtype of neuroblastoma, the MYC oncogene, exists, efforts to effectively reach this target by pharmacological agents have so far proven unsuccessful. The study in Science Translational Medicine for the first time demonstrates that MYC activity in these tumors depends on the presence of FACT and that inactivation of FACT effectively neutralizes MYC, resulting in the death of neuroblastoma cells. ""Remarkably, the presence of FACT in this type of tumor appeared to be as bad a prognostic marker as excessive activity of MYC is,"" notes paper co-author Katerina Gurova, MD, PhD, of the Roswell Park Department of Cell Stress Biology, who led efforts to decipher the mechanisms of activity through which curaxins successfully target FACT, as documented in earlier published research. CBL0137, which is being developed by Incuron, is currently being assessed in a phase I clinical trial in adults with advanced metastatic solid-tumor cancers and lymphomas at RPCI and several other U.S. cancer centers (study NCT01905228). As distinct from many of the drugs currently used to treat neuroblastoma, curaxins appear to kill cancer cells without causing DNA damage, the major source of cancer treatment side effects.

These brain cells make the neurotransmitter serotonin, which helps regulate mood, appetite, breathing rate, body temperature and more. Recently, however, scientists have begun to learn that these neurons differ from one another and that the differences likely matter in dysfunction and disease. Last year, a team led by Harvard Medical School genetics professor Susan Dymecki defined a subgroup of serotonergic neurons in mice by showing that those cells specifically, among all serotonergic neurons, were responsible for increasing the breathing rate when too much carbon dioxide builds up in the body. Now, Dymecki and colleagues have taken a first stab at systematically characterizing serotonergic neurons at the molecular level and defining a full set of subtypes, again in mice. The researchers report in Neuron that serotonergic neurons come in at least six major molecular subtypes defined by distinct expression patterns of hundreds of genes. In many cases, the subtypes modulate different behaviors in the body. By conducting a cross-disciplinary series of experiments, the researchers found that the subtypes also vary in their developmental lineage, anatomical distribution, combinations of receptors on the cell surface and electrical firing properties. ""This work reveals how diverse serotonin neurons are at the molecular level, which may help to explain how, collectively, they are able to perform so many distinct functions,"" said Benjamin Okaty, a postdoctoral researcher in the Dymecki lab and co-first author of the paper. ""To have the list of molecular players that make each of these subtypes different from one another gives us an important handle on learning more about what that cell type does and how we can manipulate only that subtype,"" said Dymecki. ""It holds enormous therapeutic potential."" ""This is an ancient neurotransmitter system that's implicated in many different diseases, and it's starting to be cracked open,"" said Morgan Freret, a graduate student in the Dymecki lab and co-first author of the paper. ""We can now ask questions in a more systematic way about which serotonergic cells and molecules are important in, for example, pain, sleep apnea or anxiety."" Crucially, the team also showed that a serotonergic neuron's gene expression and function depend not only on its location in the adult brain stem, but also on its cellular ancestor in the developing brain. ""Earlier work had shown that you could explore the relationship between a mature neuronal system and the different developmental lineages that gave rise to it, but we had no idea whether it was meaningful,"" said Dymecki. ""We show that the molecular phenotypes of these neurons track quite tightly to their developmental origin, with anatomy making some interesting contributions as well."" While the work was done in mice, Dymecki is optimistic that it will be replicated in humans because the serotonergic neuronal system is in a highly conserved region of the brain, meaning it tends to remain consistent across vertebrate species. Because of this, researchers can look for the same molecular signatures in human tissue and begin to tease apart whether particular subtypes of serotonergic neurons are involved in conditions such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or autism. Such research could ultimately reveal previously unknown contributions of the serotonergic neuronal system to disease, inform the development of biomarkers or lead to more targeted therapies. The team's findings could also inform stem cell research. ""Which subtype of serotonergic neuron are we getting when we use current stem cell protocols?"" asked Dymecki. ""Can we drive the development of different subtypes? Can we watch how gene expression patterns change over time during development for each subtype?"" Finally, the study provides an example of a highly integrative approach to understanding brain function at multiple scales, ""linking genes and gene networks to the properties of single neurons and populations of neuron subtypes, all the way up to the level of animal behaviors,"" said Okaty. ""I think it's a useful template going forward. Imagine what we'd learn by applying this approach to all the neurotransmitter systems in the brain.""

Your mother has just shared your elderly aunt's phone number, and you're repeating it as you walk to the door of your house. Suddenly a stray dog, barking and snarling, races across the lawn. Are you able to remember the number? Rewind the situation and, instead of the barking dog, see a cute puppy bounding across the yard. Do you remember the number now? Researchers at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are investigating how your brain processes distractions when you're trying to get a job done. Their paper was recently published in Cerebral Cortex. According to Alexandru Iordan, graduate student in neuroscience and co-author of the paper, most studies have concentrated on how negative distractions (the barking dog) impact our ability to complete a task. But few studies have focused on how positive distractions (the cute puppy) impact that ability. ""We knew from previous investigations that negative distractions interfere with our ability to stay focused on the task at hand,"" said Iordan. ""However, we didn't know what happens with positive distractions in terms of performance and the brain mechanisms."" The research, led by Florin Dolcos, assistant professor of psychology at Illinois and member of Beckman's Cognitive Neuroscience Group, not only investigated the difference between positive and negative distractions, but also used the MRI machines at the Biomedical Imaging Center (BIC) in the Beckman Institute to evaluate how the brain responds during these distractions. Study participants were shown a series of images of people's faces and were asked to hold them in mind for a few seconds. After a short delay, they were asked to indicate if they had seen specific faces or not. During the delay, the participants were shown a mixture of positive, neutral, and negative images; the negative and positive images were selected to produce overall similarly intense responses. The brain responses were recorded to evaluate which parts of the brain were activated when the distracting images were shown. The findings indicate that both positive and negative images affect the brain, but that positive distractions are linked to increased performance, compared with negative distraction. In other words, seeing the cute puppy grabs your attention, but will not interfere with completing the task at hand (remembering your aunt's phone number). ""The main result is that the positive distractions do not interfere with working memory performance,"" said Iordan, ""in fact, they actually help compared to the negative distractions, even though they may produce equally intense emotional responses."" The explanation for this lies in the way our brains are hard-wired. ""Positive stimuli are less imperative than the negative ones, because the immediate costs of not paying attention to them are typically smaller. For instance, evolutionarily, not paying attention to a potential food source is usually less dramatic than not paying attention to something dangerous, like a predator,"" said Dolcos. Consistent with this idea, the study found changes in two brain regions that are involved in working memory and attention, the dorso-lateral prefrontal and the lateral parietal cortices. ""These areas stay in tune with each other when we try to keep information active in our mind,"" Iordan explained. ""Negative distractions strongly reduced activity in these regions. However, positive distractions had less impact on activity in these regions and increased activity in the ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex, an area associated with emotion control. This may explain why we perform better under positive distraction -- because those distractions have less detrimental effects in brain areas involved in the ability to stay focused on the tasks at hand, and they increase activity in areas that are helping us to cope with distraction,"" said Iordan. Another brain region, the medial prefrontal cortex, also showed responses consistent with this difference in urgency between positive and negative stimuli. ""The medial prefrontal cortex is involved in emotion and self-referential processing. Here, we've seen that the responses to the negative stimuli occurred slightly earlier than the responses to the positive ones,"" added Iordan. The effects were visible also in the way these different brain regions communicated with each other. ""One fascinating thing about the brain is that the same region may behave differently in different contexts,"" said Iordan. ""It's not only about what a brain region itself does, but also about how a brain region communicates with other regions in specific contexts -- and this influences our behavior."" The researchers found that the medial prefrontal and the lateral parietal cortices behaved differently when subjects viewed negative as opposed to positive distractors. ""We found that the medial prefrontal cortex communicated more with the lateral parietal cortex under negative distraction. This increased communication does not usually happen during such tasks, because these two regions are part of different brain networks. This might also explain why negative stimuli were more impairing to working memory performance,"" said Iordan. By identifying the activity in these regions, the researchers hope that they can develop methods to help those who have emotional disorders such as anxiety or depression. Dolcos hopes that future research will create training to change the response of these areas of the brain, in order to prevent clinical depression and anxiety. ""These areas, together with others identified in our research, could be used as markers to be monitored in interventions that target improved responses that reduce the impact of emotional challenges,"" said Dolcos. ""It is important to find such markers for both positive and negative emotions, because they are both changed in depression and anxiety, which are characterized by increased sensitivity to negative emotions and reduced response to positive emotions. ""At the end of the day, we want to find ways to help people feel good. That's why we work on both aspects, enhance the positive and reduce the negative emotions, to stay healthy. Also, a lot of what we do in our research is about prevention. We can identify such markers in people who are healthy but might be at risk, and then target these markers in interventions. We all know that, in the long run, we are better off also preventing than intervening only when people are already sick. This is also the case with emotional disorders, such as depression and anxiety"" Dolcos said. Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology   press release Iordan AD, Dolcos F.

However, additional medical evidence based on such an algorithm might be useful in early diagnosis, according to work published in the International Journal of Intelligent Systems Technologies and Applications. Pawan Kumar Singh and Ram Sarkar of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, at Jadavpur University, in West Bengal, India, explain how expert systems, usually reserved for problem solving, might also be useful in medical diagnostics, particularly in psychiatry. They explain how schizophrenia is such a complex and debilitating mental disorder with a wide spectrum of symptoms, reflecting cognitive, emotional, perceptual disturbances as well as problems with motor processes. As such, it is usually a complete psychiatric examination that is used in diagnosis. However, an expert system that could spot the early onset of disparate symptoms might lead to a more timely referral for a patient and allow treatment to be offered sooner rather than later to the benefit of the patient and any carers involved in their welfare. The team explains that AI (artificial intelligence) computer programs that achieve expert-level competence in solving problems by bringing to bear a body of knowledge about specific tasks are called knowledge-based or expert systems (ES). An ES comprises two main components: a knowledge base containing facts from a particular field and a reasoning, or inference, engine that uses logical relations to process inputs by working with the information in the knowledge base. The initial studies help process reported and identified symptoms, such as delusion, hallucinations, compulsions, poverty of speech, catatonia, inability to cope with minor problems and many more. ""Treatment of schizophrenia depends largely on medications and on psychosocial interventions,"" the team emphasizes. ""No single approach is widely considered effective for all patients,"" they add. An expectation of recovery from schizophrenia is a concept that has evolved to a remarkable degree during the past century or so but the earlier the diagnosis the better.

The researchers took a closer look at a key protein in Alzheimer's pathogenisis, APP, and one of its cleavage products APPs . Prof. M ller of Heidelberg University's Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology explains that viral gene shuttles were used to drive the delivery of APPs  into the brains of Alzheimer s mouse models. The protein APPs  in turn elicited repair effects and clearly improved memory. The researchers hope to use these findings to explore new approaches in the development of gene therapy for Alzheimer's. Their results are published in the journal Acta Neuropathologica. Alzheimer's is the most frequent cause of dementia in the elderly, particularly affecting regions of the brain that are fundamental for memory and learning. The junctions through which the nerve cells communicate, the synapses, disappear long before the nerve cells die, damage that impairs both learning and memory. ""While dead nerve cells are irretrievably lost, damaged synapses can be regenerated in the elderly,"" Prof. M ller emphasizes. Plaque deposits found in the brain of Alzheimer's patients thwart the communication between the nerve cells and cause them to eventually die. The main component of these plaques is a short protein fragment known as the beta amyloid peptide. It is generated when the considerably larger amyloid precursor protein, or APP, is cleaved. ""Until now, scientists believed that the overproduction of beta amyloid peptides was the main cause of Alzheimer's. More recent investigations, however, have demonstrated that another APP cleavage product, the APPs  protein, also diminishes over the course of the disease,"" Ulrike M ller continues. The protein cleaving enzymes, secretases, play a key role in this process. ""These cleaving processes produce beta amyloid peptides that are toxic to the nerve cells, but also produce the protective APPs  cleavage product, which counteracts the toxic peptide,"" says M ller. ""Research over the last few years indicates that a misregulation of the secretase cleavage in Alzheimer's results in inadequate production of protective APPs ."" Earlier studies by M ller's research group had already shown that APPs  has an essential function in the nervous system, particularly because it regulates the formation and function of synaptic junctions and spatial memory. These findings were used to investigate a new approach for a possible gene therapy for Alzheimer's. The international research team used viral gene shuttles to introduce APPs  into the brains of mouse models with plaque deposits like those in Alzheimer's. ""After introducing the APPs , we saw that the nerve cell damage could be repaired. The number of synaptic junctions increased, and spatial memory began to function again,"" reports Ulrike M ller.

We are one step closer to understanding the underlying chemistry that leads to genetic diseases,  says Cynthia Burrows, distinguished professor and chair of chemistry at the university and senior author of a new study published in Nature Communications.  We have a way of marking and copying DNA damage sites so that we can preserve the information of where and what the damage was.  Jan Riedl, a University of Utah postdoctoral fellow and the study s first author, says 99 percent of DNA lesions are repaired naturally. The rest can lead to genetic mutations and can cause disease. The new method can  identify and detect the position of lesions that lead to diseases,  he says. Burrows says:  We are trying to look for the chemical changes in the base that can lead the cell to make a mistake, a mutation. One of the powerful things about our method is we can read more than a single damaged site [and up to dozens] on the same strand of DNA.  The chemists say their new method will let researchers study chemical details of DNA lesions or damage. Such lesions, if not repaired naturally, accumulate over time and can lead to mutations responsible for many age-related diseases, including neurological ailments such as Huntington s disease and ALS.  A method capable of identifying the chemical identity and location in which lesions appear is crucial for determining the molecular etiology [cause] of these diseases,  Burrows and colleague write in their study. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Burrows and Riedl conducted the study with University of Utah chemists Aaron Fleming, a research assistant professor, and Yun Ding, a postdoctoral researcher. The new method for finding DNA lesions combines other, existing techniques. First, the researchers find the damage and cut it out of the DNA using base excision repair, the discovery of which won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry this year for Tomas Lindahl, a scientist in England. Second, an  unnatural base pair  is inserted at the snipped-out DNA damage site to label it. Instead of natural base pairs C-G and A-T, the Utah chemists used a so-called third or unnatural base pair invented by chemists at the Scripps Research Institute in California. Burrows says her study demonstrates the first practical use of that invention. This graphic shows a new method for identifying DNA lesions, or sites of damage on DNA strands that can lead to disease-causing mutations. First the damage is cut out and replaced by so-called unnatural base pairs so chemists can amplify, or make millions of copies, of the damaged DNA. Then they label the unnatural base with a chemical called 18-crown-6 ether. which makes it easier to detect the site of DNA damage by passing the strand of DNA through molecule-size nanopore. Credit: Aaron Fleming / University of Utah  Third, the DNA with the damage site labeled by an unnatural third base pair is then amplified using PCR. Burrows says the new study s key innovation was to use base excision repair to snip out the damage and then to insert the unnatural base pair at the damage site, making it possible to make millions of copies of the DNA a process that normally would be prevented by the damage. Fourth, another chemical label, named 18-crown-6 ether, is affixed to the unnatural base pair on all the DNA strands, which are then read or sequenced using a kind of nanopore sequencing developed a few years ago by Burrows and Utah chemist Henry White. Such sequencing involves determining the order and location of bases on a DNA strand including damage sites labeled by unnatural bases by passing the strand through a molecule-size pore or nanopore. People are born with their genome or genetic blueprint of 3 billion base pairs,  and then stuff happens,  Burrows says.  There s damage from oxidative stress due to inflammation and infection, too much metabolism, or environmental chemicals.  The new method seeks  molecular details that define how our genome responds to what we eat and the air we breathe, and ends up being healthy or not,  she says. DNA lesions happen more than 10,000 times a day in a single human cell. A lesion can be a missing base, a base that has changed chemically or a break in the DNA backbone. That many lesions may seem like a lot, but with 3 billion base pairs in the genome of a single cell, the damage only affects about one of every 300,000 base pairs. The chemists tested their method on a gene named KRAS that, when mutated, can cause lung or breast cancer. The University of Utah   press release Riedl, J et al.

Investigators Prof. Richard Baines and Dr. Carlo Giachello used a genetically-altered fruit fly to show that when nervous system activity is suppressed by harnessing the power of optogenetics and shining yellow light through its embryo, it will not go on to develop symptoms of the disease when it gets older. Although the procedure has only been used on flies, the team believes the work proves for the first time that the development of epilepsy can be stopped in its tracks if treated early enough. However, the technique developed and tested over three-years and published in Current Biology, will not benefit individuals who already have epilepsy. ""We're excited by this discovery which we believe is proof of principle and a milestone in the way we understand epilepsy though clearly more research is needed in mammals,"" says Baines, ""but if these findings are taken to their logical conclusion, then we might envisage the possibility of being able to treat individuals at an early enough stage so they do not go on to develop the symptoms of epilepsy. After all, amazing though it might seem, the underlying biology of the central nervous system is the same in humans as it is in flies."" People who suffer from epilepsy, due to the presence of a gene mutation, experience a period in the disease's development called the epileptogenic process, a process by which a normal brain develops epilepsy. Scientists have already discovered that starting treatment with antiepileptic drugs during the epileptogenic process will delay the inevitable onset of seizures. However, this new procedure, which starts treatment during embryonic development and uses light to manipulate nervous system activity rather than drugs, seems to permanently prevent seizures. Flies do not have spontaneous seizures like humans but, according to the team, there is no reason to suggest that the effect would be any different. The technique involves expression of the halorhodopsin gene an optogenetic tool which allows yellow light to control cells in living tissue, such as neurons that have been genetically adapted. Giachello added: ""By using this optogenetic tool, we found that if we prevent nervous system activity at a time when the fly embryo is between 80 and 90% fully developed, seizures stop entirely. Optogenetics is a recent development in biology which is causing quite a bit of excitement, not just in the treatment of epilepsy but other illnesses too."" Scientists have identified many genes that make humans predisposed to epilepsy. The identification of these genes makes it possible to screen for the disease before it starts and, as this new research shows, it might be possibly to intervene to prevent it.

GSK3174998 is a humanised IgG1 anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody that was identified through a collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center. OX40 is a tumour necrosis factor receptor expressed on the surface of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. OX40 agonism results in stimulation of both immune effector and memory functions, while also attenuating the immunosuppressive regulatory T cells that are sometimes found in tumours. GSK3174998 is one of a number of early stage assets in GSK s oncology pipeline focused on fighting the fundamental drivers of cancer. Keytruda is a humanised monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body s immune system to help detect and fight tumour cells. Keytruda blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, and may affect both tumour cells and healthy cells. Axel Hoos, Vice President Oncology R&D at GSK, said:  There have been meaningful advances in survival across several cancers recently, mostly based on single agent checkpoint modulatory drugs. The combination study of Keytruda with GSK s OX40 agonist will seek to build on that progress with the aim of contributing further improvements for patients.  We think combining these two agents that use different aspects of the immune system may be an important step toward achieving this goal.   The initiation of this phase I trial with GSK is an important step in identifying synergistic treatment combinations that can potentially enhance the activity we are seeing with Keytruda as a monotherapy,  said Dr. Eric Rubin, vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology early stage development, Merck Research Laboratories.  We are looking forward to this trial progressing and to sharing the findings on the potential of the combination of Keytruda and GSK s GSK3174998 in bringing forward improved outcomes for patients with advanced cancer.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/study-raises-questions-about-dna-evidence-210640,Study Raises Questions About DNA Evidence University of Indianapolis researchers say contamination through secondary transfer of material could implicate the innocent or help the guilty go free  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. If your DNA is found on a weapon or at a crime scene, does that make you guilty? A judge or jury might think so, but a new study from the University of Indianapolis shows that secondary transfer of human DNA through intermediary contact is far more common than previously thought, a finding that could have serious repercussions for medical science and the criminal justice system. Increasingly important to criminal investigations, DNA analysis once required substantial samples of blood or other bodily fluids, but advances in the field now make it possible to produce a complete genetic profile of a suspect from just a few cells left behind   so-called  touch DNA.  The emerging concern, long considered a theoretical risk but only now systematically confirmed by the UIndy study, is that the presence of those cells does not prove that the person actually visited the scene or directly touched the object in question. The DNA easily could have been transferred by other means.  I think this issue has been swept under the rug,  said Associate Professor Krista Latham, who directs UIndy s Molecular Anthropology Laboratory and oversaw the study designed as a course project by Human Biology graduate students Cynthia Cale and Madison Earll.  There have been some holes in this kind of research, and I think that allowed people to disregard it, but this is a very well-designed project. It s going to change the way the medicolegal system looks at DNA evidence.  The researchers detail their findings in the January issue of the Journal of Forensic Sciences, with a paper titled  Could Secondary DNA Transfer Falsely Place Someone at the Scene of a Crime?  Cale also discusses the study in an op-ed column for this week s issue of the journal Nature. Cale is lead forensic DNA analyst at Strand Diagnostics, an Indianapolis-based laboratory that provides services to public agencies and has a collaborative partnership with UIndy s Department of Biology. Like Latham, she has served often as an expert witness for court proceedings involving DNA analysis.  It s scary,  said Cale, who is continuing her master s thesis project at UIndy.  Analysts need to be aware that this can happen, and they need to be able to go into court and effectively present this evidence. They need to school the jury and the judge that there are other explanations for this DNA to be there.  The experiment designed by Cale and Earll asked pairs of volunteers to shake hands for two minutes, after which they handled knives that were later swabbed for DNA samples. In 85 percent of the cases, DNA from the person who did not directly touch the knife was transferred in sufficient quantity to produce a profile. In one-fifth of the samples, that person was identified as the main or only contributor of DNA to the potential weapon, despite never having touched it.  Most of the articles I ve read about secondary DNA transfer say there s not really going to be any impact on the end result,  Cale said.  Getting a single-source profile is going to be very hard to dispute in court, but as you can see, that single-source profile could come from a person who hadn t even touched the knife. The person who handled the knife wasn t even detected on the knife. And there were other instances where there was a mixture, but the person who didn t touch it, they were the majority.  Therefore, not only can secondary DNA transfer falsely link someone to a crime, but it also can weaken the impact of potential evidence that could have been used to identify the guilty party.  This research highlights the need to eliminate  touch DNA  from our vocabulary,  said Earll, who has since earned her degree and now works as a microbiologist for Pace Analytical on assignment at Elanco Animal Health.  It s clear that this term is misleading and does not adequately explain all of the possible ways that DNA can end up on an object.  The concern is not just theoretical. In a 2013 California case, a man was arrested and held for months on a murder charge after his DNA was found on a homicide victim. The charges were dropped after it was determined that the DNA probably was transferred to the victim by paramedics who had come into contact with each of them on separate emergency runs. Such possibilities, however, often are not raised in court proceedings. Instead, the jury hears only that the DNA sample has a high mathematical probability of coming from the person in question, implying that the suspect must have been present.  With a full profile, you see stats like one in a quadrillion, so when you present that in court, that s even harder to dispute,  Cale said. The researchers plan to continue their experiments in the coming months, systematically reducing the contact time between the test subjects to see if the same level of secondary transfer can occur with a shorter period of exposure, making potential contamination an even greater concern.  DNA never lies, right? But sometimes the only evidence they have in a case is DNA, and this emphasizes that we need to interpret the entirety of a case,  said Latham, known internationally for her work as a forensic anthropologist.  Even everyday people on a jury need to understand that DNA is not this magic bullet   that it needs to be interpreted just like any piece of evidence. ","Published: November 6, 2015"

Financial details of this agreement were not disclosed. Under the terms of the agreement, CEVEC will provide its expertise in process development as well as its competence in GMP production, in collaboration with its joint venture partner GenIbet, of selected laminins based on the Company s proprietary CAP Go technology. This joined competence embraces cell line and process development, GMP cell banking and GMP production including fill & finish. CEVEC retains the rights to develop laminins for therapeutic use and grants BioLamina an exclusive license for the commercialization of CAP Go based laminins patented by BioLamina for ex vivo cell culture therapies. The first laminin, Laminin-521, which is used to proliferate stem cells without causing genomic abnormalities, will be launched in 2016. BioLamina focuses on research and development, to understand how laminins can be used to deplete technical problems associated in primary cell culture as well as on global sales and marketing of the commercially produced and finished products through its direct sales force and network of distributors. In this long-term strategic cooperation, BioLamina plans to initially add up to six new variants of laminins to its leading portfolio of recombinant laminins to enable cell culture of an accelerating range of human cell types with increased reliability and quality.  The agreement with BioLamina is again an endorsement of our CAP Go expression platform and represents a further milestone in our strategy to continuously open up new areas for our technology. It also marks the transition of the Company towards a  Center of Expertise  in tailor-made glycosylation of recombinant proteins,  commented Frank Ubags, Chief Executive Officer of CEVEC Pharmaceuticals GmbH.  Over recent months, we successfully positioned CAP Go as the technology of choice in high growth areas including difficult to express glycoproteins for ex vivo cell culture therapies as well as therapeutically relevant plasma and serum proteins. Today, manufacturing is still a limiting factor for the therapeutic use of recombinant glycoproteins. Given the superior pharmacokinetic profiles shown by CAP Go-derived glycoproteins, we are anticipating drug development companies to switch from CHO-Technologies and HEK 293-Technologies to our CAP Go technology.   CEVEC s CAP Go technology and their expertise in cell line development, process development and manufacturing is crucial for us to meet the increasing demand of LN-521 as well as changing the laminin production process to meet regulatory guidelines for clinical use in advanced cell therapies,  said Kristian Tryggvason, Chief Executive Officer of BioLamina AB.

Commenting on the latest revisions to pharmacopoeia test methods for pharmaceutical glassware, including bottles, vials, ampoules, cartridges and syringes, GTS Laboratory Manager Daniel Capon, said:  The United States (USP) and European (Ph. Eur.) Pharmacopoeias remain the most widely used in the global market and recent revisions to both monographs continue to harmonize requirements between the two - bringing welcome simplification and, in some cases, savings for customers that regularly test to both the USP and Ph. Eur. Standards.   The latest revisions, USP 38-NF33 and Ph. Eur 8.3, further emphasize recommendations for propensity and stability studies - with direct references now being included within both USP <660> and Ph. Eur 3.2.1 for the first time.   This is a key concern for many drug manufacturers looking to approve their products within EU and US marketplaces and we have seen a dramatic increase in global companies coming to us for advice, consultancy and study programmes. As such a specialist area it is understandable that there is so much concern and uncertainty in this area   we are one of only a few laboratories that hold the necessary specialist glass knowledge, experience and equipment . Key changes include:  Direct reference to the recommendation for delamination propensity or evaluation studies within both USP <660> and Ph. Eur 3.2.1 for the first time;  Stricter autoclave programmes within respective glass grains and surface tests across both monographs, with additional requirements for the time-temperature profiles that must be achieved in both heating and cooling of samples and the required use of external thermocouples for temperature logging;  Mechanical sieve-shakers/sieving machines now allowed within glass grains preparation in both the USP and Ph. Eur. Daniel explains,  This ongoing harmonization is another positive step forward and builds upon significant unification between USP 37-NF32 and Ph. Eur 8.0 in 2014 - which saw the USP adopt the Ph. Eur. glass grains and surface tests.   The key concern for many pharmaceutical and medical companies comes down to the growing need for glass surface delamination evaluation, propensity and stability studies. This has been a key area of support and development for us in recent years   with a range of services available and our direct involvement in research groups, including the International Commission on Glass  Technical Committee TC12 for glass delamination . GTS provides accredited testing services for pharmaceutical and medical companies as well as glass manufacturers and processors and participates in collaborative studies on glass containers for pharmaceutical and medical use. In addition to United States (USP) and European Pharmacopoeia (EP/Ph.

Financial terms were not disclosed. Founded in 2010 as a spin out of HEE and West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Northwood Medical Innovations has developed a pioneering implant technology, earFold  as an alternative to conventional otoplasty surgery in the correction of prominent ears. A minimally invasive technique, the procedure takes 20 minutes under local anaesthetic as an outpatient, compared to the traditional two hours in general surgery. Overall patient outcomes are improved with reduced risk of keloid scaring and cartilage damage, less chance of infection, faster recovery times and improved symmetry when both ears are being corrected.earFold received a CE mark in April 2015, and has been made available by Northwood Medical Innovation to trained and accredited surgeons, primarily in the UK. Upon closure of the deal Allergan intends to commercialize the product widely across Europe, in line with its CE mark, and will continue to explore the regulatory pathways and necessary clinical data requirements to commercialize this medical device in other countries, including the United States of America. HEE funded the early proof of concept work including animal studies, provided ongoing IPR support and developed the company s business plan prior to spin-out. Revenues due to HEE from the sale will be re-invested into ensuring that other pioneering innovations from staff across the NHS are identified, developed and commercialized. Anne Blackwood, CEO of HEE, said:  We are delighted to see the first trade sale of an HEE backed company and to have supported the development and successful commercialization of such an exciting innovation that originated from the NHS. Allergan is an excellent home for the earFold technology with its strong global presence and established range of medical aesthetics  products. We look forward to seeing the procedure becoming widely adopted for the benefit of many more patients.  Norbert Kang, Consultant Plastic Surgeon and creator of the earFold, said:  Following a complex outcome after a standard otoplasty procedure, early in my career, I was motivated to develop an alternative approach to correcting prominent ears.  In my clinical practice, there are a significant number of patients who are reluctant to undergo surgery and so put up with accepting the social hindrance of prominent ears. The beauty of the earFold treatment system is that it offers an evidenced-based alternative to standard otoplasty surgery that may meet the needs of a wider range of patients, by delivering immediate and predictable results, without the risks associated with general anaesthetic.

An MIT-led project taking that idea to heart has demonstrated a new method for getting local citizens and leaders to agree on the best ways of managing the immediate and long-term effects of climate change. The New England Climate Adaptation Project (NECAP) got local citizens and officials in four coastal towns to engage in role-playing games about climate change tailored to their communities, while conducting local polling about attitudes and knowledge about climate risks. In so doing, the project helped the towns reach new conclusions about local initiatives to address the threats posed by climate change  which in coastal communities may include rising sea levels and increased storm surges that can lead to flooding.  One hour of conversation can completely alter people s sense [and show] that this is a problem they can work on locally,  says Lawrence Susskind, the Ford Professor in Urban Studies in MIT s Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP), who led the project and has now co-authored a new book detailing its results.  There are a bunch of things local governments can do, and people can do for themselves   that communities can do.  The findings stem from years of research and organizing in four places: Wells, Maine; Dover, New Hampshire; Barnstable, Massachusetts; and Cranston, Rhode Island. The new book on the effort,  Managing Climate Risks in Coastal Communities,  has just been released by the academic publisher Anthem Press. Among the many findings of the project is that residents of these coastal communities were typically far more concerned about the consequences of climate change than local politicians realized.  People in official positions really underestimated the extent to which [citizens] were worried about what climate change might mean to the town, what their vulnerabilities were,  Susskind explains.  If you asked,  What percentage of people do you think believe climate change is a problem right now?  most officials would have said less than 10 percent. Our polling results were about 60 percent.  The scenarios that the MIT-led team presented to people in each place involved ranges of probability regarding potential events. And yet, Susskind emphasizes, certain types of climate responses, like building better storm drains, may be necessary in almost any scenario.  Lots of uncertainty doesn t mean you can t decide or know what to do,  Susskind says.  There are no-regrets actions you can take, where you won t regret spending the money, time, or effort later.  Four towns, many issuesThe scholars chose the four towns because each hosts a center for the National Estuarine Research Reserve System, a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That made it simpler for the project leaders to make connections with local political leaders and convince them to participate in the climate adaptation project. The book is co-authored by four project leaders, including Susskind, who heads the Environmental Policy and Planning Group at DUSP as well as the mediation group he founded, the Consensus Building Institute (CBI); Danya Rumore, visiting assistant professor at the University of Utah; Carrie Hulet, a senior associate at the CBI; and Patrick Field, co-managing director of the CBI and an associate director of the MIT-Harvard Public Disputes Program. After developing climate-change scenarios for each town and conducting research on local political priorities and infrastructure, starting in 2012, the MIT group developed a role-playing game tailored to each town, and conducted debriefings on the issues as well. Citizens who participate study the local climate scenarios and potential responses, and try to reach consensus on plans of action. An investment of a few hours can suddenly make hundreds of community members more informed and willing to consider the need for climate response.  The science doesn t dictate things, but it informs things, and it leads to interesting conversations about what the policy for their own community should be,  Susskind says. In Dover, for instance, the effort helped clarify the need to act on local concerns about flooding from the town s river, and about the capabilities of the town s storm drains; dredging the river and updating the drains are now higher priorities, along with having more generators on hand for emergency response activities. In Barnstable, where sea level rise, flooding, drought, and storm damage are all problematic issues, the project clarified the need to add water supplies and make the electrical grid more sustainable. In Wells, where sea levels are projected to rise by 2 to 5 feet by 2099, the project highlighted the need for seawalls and a buyback program for privately owned coastal land that could absorb flooding. In Cranston, flooding is a major issue   following floods the town experienced in 2010   and the project revealed that 86 percent of residents are concerned about climate change. Possible measures include engineered barriers and expanded wetlands, but the project also reveals a need for continued public education programs about the affordability of possible responses. Still, acting sooner rather than later, Susskind suggests, will usually turn out to be a wise investment.  Don t be convinced that was a one-time flood,  he says.  It s going to happen sooner and more often than you think, and the cost could be enormous without some effort to manage risks. And maybe as a community you say,  Bad things are going to happen unless we find some way to reduce our vulnerabilities.  Adaptation, as well as mitigationThe MIT-led project dealt with climate adaptation, the response to climate change risks. As Susskind acknowledges, that is only one part of the climate-action picture; the issue of climate mitigation   that is, preventing climate change from happening to the fullest extent possible   is also vital. And while the role-playing games were limited to smaller communities, Susskind acknowledges, he thinks this approach can work in much larger municipalities as well, based on similar work he has done in Maryland and other places.  I don t think there are any problems of scaling up,  he says. The researchers have put many materials online, available for public study. However, Susskind says, there is no substitute for participating in the project s games in person, to work through issues of evaluating a town s needs and negotiating over them.  The whole point politically is to organize a constituency for change in each locality, and that requires face-to-face interaction,  Susskind says.  There s no substitute. I design different games for different places. You have to tailor it so that people get a sense they re learning something about the place where they are. It s about empowering a community to feel we can and should be working to anticipate and manage climate risks. ","Published: November 6, 2015"

The resulting Moneta Research project   led by Asystec Data Solutions, the University of Ulster and the Clinical Translational Research and Innovation Centre (C-TRIC)   will use the funding to support their research into identifying people most likely to develop Alzheimer s. The collaborative project will apply  beyond  computational analysis and modelling to a large biological and clinical dataset of Alzheimer s patients, and will bring together clinical research skills from the across the University and C-TRIC with analytics expertise from Asystec to collaboratively build predictive models that can be used to estimate the likely probability of currently healthy patients developing a major neurodegenerative disorder like Alzheimer s. Chris Roche, CEO at Aridhia said,  We are delighted that the collaboration have chosen AnalytiXagility as the platform for Moneta Research. Asystec have made great strides in the last twelve months with the data services they offer. Winning this award in collaboration with the University of Ulster, in such an important area of research, is a real boost for Northern Ireland and demonstrates Asystec s continued leadership in bringing data innovation to Ireland.  The project will utilize the new functional brain mapping facility at the University of Ulster to create an enhanced dataset, based on imaging data, which can then be utilized to increase the accuracy of the predictive model. Working with such datasets requires a cutting-edge data platform and Aridhia are delighted that AnalytiXagility has been chosen to enable the collaborative analysis of the project s large complex and heterogeneous datasets, which include demographics, medical history, neuropsychology scores, blood analysis, diagnosis, and neuroimaging data. Dave Clarke, Chief Data Scientist, at Asystec said,  A big challenge for Alzheimer s research is the integration and analysis of big heterogenous data to holistically understand the disease and the stratification of treatments. We ve worked with Aridhia for over a year now and their focus on building a platform that supports collaborative clinical and healthcare research made AnalytiXagility an easy choice for us when selecting a partner to work with.  The hope is that, by through linking among different biomarkers, the resulting predictive models might reveal new disease signatures, relationships and treatments, and encourage a move towards early identification of risk of developing Alzheimer s disease.","Published: November 6, 2015"

Former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt said it was ""the most useful gift."" And, yes, we all know what killed the cat. But ask a group of scientists to define curiosity and you'll get a rousing debate, and a lot of unanswered questions about its biology. No more, argue two University of Rochester researchers in a review of curiosity science published in Neuron. They propose that it's time for researchers to organize and focus on curiosity's function, evolution, mechanism, and development. ""Curiosity is a long-standing problem that is fascinating but has been difficult to approach scientifically,"" says co-author Benjamin Hayden, an assistant professor of brain and cognitive sciences. ""But we felt that the field has recently managed to develop new formal and quantifiable techniques for studying curiosity and that it's worth getting the word out. There are several people, working in several different disciplines, who may not be aware of each other's work, but who should be."" It's not uncommon for neuroscientists to study something (e.g., attention, reward, self-control, etc.) for which there is no agreed upon definition. ""Fighting over the proper definition is a big part of figuring out how they work,"" says co-author Celeste Kidd of the Rochester Baby Lab and Rochester Kid Lab. ""We have to be comfortable with that kind of basic uncertainty."" Scientists have been taking notes about curiosity since the 19th century. In humans, psychologists used biographies from mothers to study how children were drawn toward new objects or experiences. Animal curiosity also became a fascination for well-known researchers like Ivan Pavlov and Harry Harlow, who saw this ""What-is-it?"" reflex as a basic drive. Over time, studies have tried to differentiate curiosity by saying it is entirely intrinsically motivated (compared to information-seeking and risk-seeking), but this type of definition runs into problems when determining the intrinsic motivation of babies, primates, and other organisms that cannot communicate their inner world. For their Review, the authors used a working definition of curiosity ""as a drive state for information,"" which can be observed in organisms as simple as nematode worms. ""When the information-seeking becomes active, it's reasonable to start talking about it as a minimal form of curiosity,"" Hayden says. ""This definition, and the idea that roundworms may be curious, will be hard for some people to swallow. But by looking at it from an evolutionary perspective--the benefits of information-seeking in general--scientists can make rapid progress; but by sitting around and arguing about what is and is not curiosity, progress will be much slower."" One question still up for debate is whether curiosity always carries benefits--whether immediately or in the future. A popular notion in education literature is that the function of curiosity is to facilitate learning and thus success increases with the degree of one's curiosity. It's agreed that information allows for better choices, but curiosity can lead animals to pursue stimuli that aren't necessarily useful. While increasing curiosity reduces uncertainty and makes for better choices on what to explore, the animals' brains are also wired to reward us for learning new information, which can put us at different risks. ""Everything in life involves trade-offs,"" Kidd says. ""If we spend time watching a TV show because we are curious about what happened, then we spend less time working on our jobs. So there is definitely a balance, and too much curiosity can be harmful."" While not covered in-depth in their Review, the authors also note that the study of curiosity overlaps with ADHD and other attentional disorders. Most of us devote our attention or curiosity to learning things with personal relevance (e.g., Why is traffic slowing down? Who are my ancestors? What's my beau's favorite color?), but these disorders could impair attention in a way that prompts interest in non-ideal information. Hayden and Kidd hope that in addition to the understanding how curiosity is affected by disease, the future will bring new information about how curiosity is controlled, how it differs between childhood and adulthood, and the link between curiosity and learning. Finally, the authors are also optimistic that scientists will eventually agree on a way to classify curiosity. Cell Press Kidd C, Hayden BY. The Psychology and Neuroscience of Curiosity.

One reason for this resistance could be their ability to form a communication network. This was discovered by scientists taking part in an international study involving experts from the Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC) of the Medical University (MedUni) of Vienna and Vienna General Hospital. The study is published in the journal Nature and is regarded as a milestone. Gliomas are tumors of the central nervous system and are subdivided into astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. Whilst oligodendrogliomas are relatively rare, with only 40 new cases every year, and respond well to standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments, astrocytomas are highly invasive and difficult to treat. For this reason they are also associated with a poor prognosis: sufferers usually only survive for a few years. In Austria around 400 people develop an astrocytoma every year. Until now it has not been understood why astrocytomas respond so poorly to current treatments compared with other gliomas. In the present study, which was set up in collaboration with the University of Heidelberg, the study team successfully identified a starting point that opens up the possibility of treating astrocytomas more effectively in future. Matthias Preusser, specialist in brain tumors at the University Department of Internal Medicine I at MedUni Vienna and Vienna General Hospital, head of the CCC unit for tumors of the central nervous system (CCC-CNS) and co-author of the new study, in which the Clinical Institute for Neurology of MedUni Vienna and Vienna General Hospital also took part, says: ""Astrocytomas form interconnecting communication networks. To do this, the tumor cells form long thin channels from their membranes, so-called tumor microtubules, that connect them to other tumor cells. They use these channels to exchange information and molecules in the form of electrical charges and calcium. This network favors the spread of tumor cells, cell division and makes astrocytomas more resistant to treatment."" Indeed, using this network, astrocytomas are able to initiate repair mechanisms and so eliminate any damage to individual tumor cells caused, for example, by radiotherapy treatment. One approach to achieving more therapeutic success in the future is to disrupt communication between the astrocytomas by blocking the channel system. Preusser: ""It is conceivable that greater therapeutic success could be achieved by using drugs to disrupt the formation or function of the membrane channels."" The research team was able to show that the network interfaces are created by a certain molecule, connexin 43, that is able to form pores. On the other hand, the protein GAP 43 seems to play an important role in the formation of the microtubules. Preusser: ""Potential treatment strategies could therefore be to chemically inhibit the tumour cell network using calcium blockers or substances that affect connexin 43 or GAP 43.""

Now researchers from the University of Southampton have discovered a possible solution for side effects seen in immunotherapy treatment for Alzheimer's. Immunotherapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's that uses antibodies to stimulate the immune system to remove amyloid beta proteins which accumulates in the brain (in deposits known as plaques) and is thought to be a major factor driving Alzheimer's neurodegenerative effects. Antibodies directed against amyloid beta have been able to successfully clear plaques and reverse cognitive deficits in mouse models. However, despite this success, clinical trials using these antibodies caused inflammatory side effects in the brain of Alzheimer's patients, in particular amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), which results in small bleeds and dangerous brain swelling. The multidisciplinary Southampton team, led by Dr Jessica Teeling, and in collaboration with Lundbeck (a multinational pharmaceutical company based in Denmark), engineered three antibodies to change the way they engage cells in the immune system. They found that small but precise changes in the anti-amyloid antibodies preserved the immunotherapeutic activity without the inflammatory side effects. Dr. Jessica Teeling, Associate Professor in Immunology at The Centre for Biological Sciences, says: ""New antibodies are entering the clinic for Alzheimer's disease; therefore, it is important to learn all we can from research into these novel interventions and use antibody engineering technology to optimize their effects."" While these results underline the potential of antibodies to destroy disease-causing plaques in patients and provide possible future treatments, they also indicate that further work is needed to increase antibody potency, but without increasing inflammatory side effects. Dr. Stavenhagen, Head of Biologics at Lundbeck, notes: ""These studies provide a roadmap of how to apply the advances in antibody engineering to antibody therapeutics that target neurodegenerative diseases. The next generation of antibody drugs to enter the clinic will contain new technologies and enhancements to improve the properties required to clear plaques, while keeping the rest of the brain safe.""

Omega 3 fatty acids are widely thought to be essential for good health and are naturally found in fatty fish, such as tuna, seafood and some nuts and seeds. Omega 3 fatty acids have been widely promoted globally and are readily available, over-the-counter supplement. These supplements have hugely increased in popularity over the last decade together with a range of other supplements including ginseng, garlic, green tea, as well as vitamins, minerals and herbal products. More recently there have been various studies that have suggested a role for Omega 3 fatty acid supplementation in treating major depressive disorder. Adults with major depressive disorders are characterized by depressed mood or a lack of pleasure in previously enjoyed activities for at least two weeks, in the absence of any physical cause, that impact on everyday life. Figures published by the World Health Organization in 2011 estimated major depressive disorders to account for 3% of global ill health and projections for 2030 suggest an increase to 6% or 7%. A new Cochrane review, published in the Cochrane Library, gathered together data from 26 randomized trials involving a total of 1,458 participants. The trials investigated the impact of giving an Omega 3 fatty acid supplement in a capsule form and compared it to a dummy pill. In one study, involving 40 participants, they also investigated the impact of the same supplementation compared to an anti-depressant treatment. The Cochrane authors found that whilst people who were given Omega 3 fatty acids reported lower symptom scores than people with the dummy pill, the effect was small and there were important limitations that undermined their confidence in the results. Their analyses showed that although similar numbers of people experienced side effects, more data would be required to understand the risks of taking Omega 3 fatty acids. Lead author, Katherine Appleton from Bournemouth University said, ""We found a small-to-modest positive effect of Omega 3 fatty acids compared to placebo, but the size of this effect is unlikely to be meaningful to people with depression, and we considered the evidence to be of low or very low quality. All studies contributing to our analyses were of direct relevance to our research question, but most of these studies are small and of low quality."" She added, ""At present, we just don't have enough high quality evidence to determine the effects of Omega 3 fatty acids as a treatment for major depressive disorder. It's important that people who suffer from depression are aware of this, so that they can make more informed choices about treatment."" Wiley Churchill R et al.

This conclusion is supported by new research from Lund University in Sweden. Many people with Parkinson's disease eventually experience walking and balance difficulties, despite adequate medication. Moreover, some patients cannot fully take dopamine-based medication, as dopamine can lead to side effects. The current research findings verify similar data from a previous study by other researchers, which was performed on brain tissue from a small number of deceased patients. ""The strength of our study is the number of participants, and the fact that they are alive. Because many suffer from several parallel diseases at the final stage of their lives, it is difficult to analyse samples from deceased persons"", explains Oskar Hansson, of Lund University and consultant at Sk ne University Hospital. The findings, published in the journal Neurology, were made when the researchers used a broad approach when looking for mechanisms to increase understanding of how Parkinson's disease works. ""The measurements showed clear connections between markers of angiogenesis in the brain and walking or balance difficulties among the participants. We also noted an increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, which leads to blood components potentially leaking into the brain and causing damage"", says Oskar Hansson. The first part of the study included 100 Parkinson's patients and 38 healthy control persons at Sk ne University Hospital in Malm . Through a cerebrospinal fluid sample, several different proteins that indicate formation of blood vessels in the brain were measured. To ensure the results, two additional groups of patients of approximately the same size were also tested. ""Medication for angiogenesis already exists. If we can confirm our results in further studies, these drugs can be tested on Parkinson's patients in the future"", says Oskar Hansson. Before it may be time to test the drugs in clinical studies, Oskar Hansson and his colleagues plan on conducting an animal study, to gain further knowledge about the mechanisms that are believed to cause problems for Parkinson's patients, and to enable a selection of the most appropriate drugs to use.

Unfortunately, the therapy has a known side effect of permanent hearing loss, resulting from damage to the inner ear. Investigators at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) now report that this type of chemotherapy may not only impact hearing, but that the hearing loss may then contribute to long-term neurocognitive deficits. The study is published in the journal Pediatric Blood & Cancer. ""Neurocognitive effects are associated with radiation therapy for brain tumors; however, the use of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens to reduce or eliminate radiation therapy were thought to spare these harmful side effects to the brain, despite their known impact on hearing,"" said Etan Orgel, MD, MS, attending physician at CHLA and principal investigator on the study. ""Our research suggests that, despite this practice shift in therapy, the impact of hearing loss itself in brain tumor survivors leads to long-term neurocognitive problems."" In both the general pediatric population and among children with non-brain related tumors, even mild hearing loss has been associated with declines in academic performance and language acquisition. However, recent studies did not specify the exact parameters of such declines, and included only a brief follow-up period. The CHLA researchers suspected that a longer follow-up period might reveal greater information about the true neurocognitive impact, as well as specific areas affected. Their retrospective analysis involved patients under the age of 21 years old who were treated for malignant brain tumors at Children's Hospital Los Angeles or Miller Children's & Women's Hospital Long Beach. Treatment included platinum-based chemotherapy as well as a broad array of regimens, including radiation therapy and/or bone marrow transplantation. Care at the two participating institutions included comprehensive screening for late-effects -- health problems that develop as a result of cancer therapy -- inclusive of neurocognitive and audiological changes. For purposes of this study, the presence of sensorineural hearing loss was determined as a level consistent with a patient's need for a hearing aid after treatment. Developmentally appropriate neuropsychological testing included evaluation of intelligence, executive function, memory, visual-motor integration and achievement. Time from diagnosis to audiology testing was two to three years, and the interval for neurocognitive testing was four to five years from start of treatment. Patients who received radiation therapy were balanced between the two groups -- individuals with and without hearing loss. Among brain tumor survivors treated with platinum-based therapies, 55 percent sustained sensorineural hearing loss. Independent of radiation therapy effects, patients who experienced hearing loss were found to have significant deficits in intelligence, executive function, and verbal reasoning skills. The study indicates that children who received radiation therapy and developed hearing loss are at particularly high-risk for neurocognitive decline. The report also strongly suggests that even children spared radiation therapy who develop hearing loss are at high risk for severe deficits and warrant similar neurocognitive monitoring and potential intervention. ""This is the first report to reveal the specific pattern of hearing loss-associated deficits, pointing to a serious risk for cognitive dysfunction, daily difficulties, and poorer lifetime achievement,"" Orgel added. ""Armed with this information, we can begin to take steps to mitigate the effects of hearing loss resulting from platinum-based chemotherapy, through early intervention and developing appropriate strategies for neurocognitive rehabilitation."" ""As we work to develop more effective treatments for children with cancer, we are ever mindful of the side effects associated with these therapies,"" said Alan S.

Neurodegenerative diseases are incurable and debilitating conditions that result in degeneration or death of cells in the nervous system. Conditions such as prion disorders (the most famous of which is ""Mad Cow Disease""), Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease share two key features: they emerge as a result of aberrant protein folding and aggregation, and their onset is late in life. These maladies emerge either sporadically or as familial, mutation-linked illnesses (certain prion disease can be also infectious). Most sporadic cases are diagnosed during the patient's seventh decade of life or later, while familial cases typically manifest during the fifth or sixth decade. Despite their relative rareness, mutation-linked cases are very important, as they provide hints that can help decipher the mechanisms that underlie the development of the disease. The late onset feature typical to distinct neurodegenerative diseases, and the common temporal emergence patterns of these maladies, raise key questions: first, why do individuals who carry disease-linked mutation show no clinical signs until their fifth or sixth decade of life? In addition, why do apparently distinct disorders share a common temporal emergence pattern? One possible explanation is that as people age, the efficiency of the mechanisms that protect younger people from the toxic aggregation of proteins declines, thus exposing them to disease. Indeed, previous studies clearly indicate that the aging process plays key roles in enabling neurodegenerative disorders to onset late in life. These finding raised the question of what mechanisms are negatively regulated by aging, allowing the emergence of neurodegeneration in the elderly. Since neurodegenerative disorders stem from aberrant protein folding, an international research team, led by Prof. Ehud Cohen and Dr. Tziona Ben-Gedalya at The Institute for Medical Research Israel   Canada (IMRIC) in the Hebrew University s Faculty of Medicine, postulated that an aging-associated decline in the activity of proteins that assist other proteins to fold properly, may be one mechanism that exposes the elderly to neurodegeneration. To identify such mechanisms, they searched for similar mutational patterns in different proteins that are linked to the development of distinct neurodegenerative disorders. Their research showed that the development of Alzheimer's disease in certain families, and of a familial prion disorder in other families, originate from very similar mutational patterns. Based on this discovery, they identified that the malfunction of the protein ""cyclophilin B,"" which helps nascent proteins to attain their proper spatial structures, is responsible for the manifestation of both maladies. They also comprehensively characterized the mechanism that underlies the development of Alzheimer's disease in individuals who carry these mutations, and found that it has no relevance to the emergence of the disease in patients who carry other Alzheimer's-linked mutations. According to Cohen:  This study provides important new insights: first, it shows that the development of distinct neurodegenerative disorders stems from a similar mechanism. More importantly, it indicates that Alzheimer's disease can emanate from more than one mechanism, suggesting that it is actually a collection of diseases that should be classified.  The new insights derived from this study may reinforce the efforts to develop novel therapies to the different subtypes of Alzheimer's disease, providing new hope to those who suffer from this incurable disorder and to their families. Cohen added: ""Our study proposes that the failure to develop efficient Alzheimer's therapy emanates from the pooling, in clinical experiments, of patients who suffer from distinct disorders that eventually lead to Alzheimer's symptoms. Therefore it is essential to carefully characterize and classify the mechanisms that underlie Alzheimer's disease, in order to allow for the development of novel therapies that can be prescribed to the individual patient according to their relevant disease subtype.""

The group used eye drops to deliver the gene for a growth factor called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in a mouse model of brain ischemia, which refers to a lack of blood and hence, oxygen, to the brain. The treatment led to a significant reduction in brain atrophy, neurological deficits, and death in the mice. The research team also devised a system to monitor the success of the gene delivery using MRI. The combination of simple delivery and non-invasive monitoring has the potential to contribute to improved studies of experimental gene therapy in animal models of stroke, Alzheimer s dementia, Parkinson s disorder, and ALS. The system also offers the intriguing possibility that acute brain injury may someday be treated by emergency medical workers through the simple delivery of eye drops carrying a therapeutic gene. In past studies in a number of animal models of brain disorders including stroke, Alzheimer s, and Parkinson s, G-CSF held promise as a potential treatment. However, when tested in a human trial in more than 400 stroke patients, G-CSF did not improve treatment outcomes, so enthusiasm about it diminished. In the studies conducted in humans, it was not possible to determine whether G-CSF was successfully expressed in the brains of the patients, which could explain the discrepancy in results in humans versus mice. To thoroughly test the efficacy of any gene therapies in humans, it is critical to establish that the gene is expressed in the test participants. Recognizing that the lack of a technology to verify gene expression in humans was a central problem in such studies, Philip K. Liu, Ph.D., of the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Harvard Medical School, and his collaborators, Drs. H. Prentice and J. Wu of Florida Atlantic University, developed a novel system for G-CSF delivery and monitoring of treatment. MRI was used to confirm successful administration and expression of G-CSF delivered to the brain using gene therapy. MRI was also used to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment in experimentally induced brain ischemia. The work is reported in the July issue of Gene Therapy.  This new, rapid, non-invasive administration and evaluation of gene therapy has the potential to be successfully translated to humans,  says Richard Conroy, Ph.D., Director of the NIBIB Division of Applied Science and Technology.  The use of MRI to specifically image and verify gene expression, now gives us a much clearer picture of how effective the gene therapy is. The dramatic reduction in brain atrophy in mice, if verified in humans, could lead to highly effective emergency treatments for stroke and other diseases that often cause brain damage such as heart attack.  The first goal of Liu s team was to develop a simplified technique that would allow rapid delivery of G-CSF to the brain without elaborate technologies requiring highly trained staff and equipment. This is particularly important for stroke and cardiac arrest, where treatment within a few hours is critical. The second goal was to devise a non-invasive method to demonstrate that G-CSF was delivered to the brain and expressed at therapeutic levels. The overall aim is to successfully demonstrate a system in animals that can be translated to humans. The researchers used a mouse model of brain damage caused by blocking oxygen to the brain. The G-CSF was delivered by inserting the G-CSF gene into an adenovirus that is safe in humans and known to infect brain cells efficiently. The adenovirus was then administered through eye drops. An advantage of this simple eye drop method is the ability to easily give multiple treatments. Delivering the G-CSF gene at multiple time points after the induced blockage led to significant reduction in deaths, cerebral atrophy, and neurological deficits as measured by behavioral testing of the treated mice. The researchers used MRI to confirm that G-CSF was expressed in treated mouse brains and to visualize the differences in brain tissue damage in both control and treated mice. For control mice, which did not receive G-CSF in eye drops, the MRI technique identified brain areas with reduced metabolic activity and eventual cerebral atrophy as the result of ischemia. Mice treated with the G-CSF gene therapy retained normal levels of metabolic activity and did not reveal any areas of cerebral atrophy. On average, following ischemia, mouse brain striatum size was reduced more than 3-fold, from 15 square millimeters in normal mice to less than 5 square millimeters. In contrast, G-CSF-treated mice retained an average striatum volume of more than 13 square millimeters close to normal volume. To confirm G-CSF gene expression, the researchers used a contrast agent attached to a piece of DNA that targets the G-CSF gene. The combination molecule enabled MRI imaging of G-CSF gene expression in the brains of treated mice. Control mice treated with the same adenovirus carrying the contrast agent bound to a different control gene produced no MRI signal in the brain.  We are very excited about the potential of this system for eventual use in the clinic,  says Liu,  The eye drop administration allows us to do additional treatments with ease when necessary. The MRI allows us to track gene expression and treatment success over time. The fact that both methods are non-invasive increases the ability to develop, and successfully test gene therapy treatments in humans.  The group is now taking steps necessary for a clinical trial, which includes obtaining FDA approval of the use of the G-CSF gene in humans and collaborating with physicians to develop a clinical trial protocol.

The trial, which is expected to start in the first half of 2016, will focus on severe structural airway disease (SSAD), a potentially life-threatening condition believed to affect 19,000 people in Europe and the US. Along with Videregen as commercial partner, the consortium includes the Cell Therapy Catapult, University College London (UCL), NHS Blood and Transplant in Speke and the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust. The Phase I trial, which will recruit four patients with SSAD, is to assess the safety and initial efficacy of the product. While replacement trachea technologies have been tested previously in compassionate use cases, this is the first formal clinical trial of a tissue engineered autologous stem cell trachea replacement. The INSPIRE project started in 2014, and has GBP 1.9 million of funding from Innovate UK. SSAD is associated with significant airway obstruction leading to high levels of morbidity and a 50 percent mortality rate if not treated successfully. Current treatment involves surgery which has a high incidence of failure and lack of efficacy. In contrast, this tracheal replacement approach, which involves repopulating an acellular trachea 'scaffold' with the patient's own stem cells, is designed to be a one-off curative treatment without the need for a lifetime of anti-rejection drugs thereafter. The INSPIRE clinical trial will be led by Professors Martin Birchall and Mark Lowdell at UCL with the Cell Therapy Catapult as clinical trial sponsor and a provider of regulatory expertise. Videregen s proprietary decellularisation technology, originally developed at Northwick Park Institute for Medical Research, is used by NHS Blood and Transplant to manufacture the trachea scaffold. The Centre for Cell, Gene and Tissue Therapy at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust has developed the stem cell seeding processes so that the final product can be manufactured in its state-of-the-art facilities. Speaking for the consortium, Dr Steve Bloor, CEO of Videregen, said,  Approval from the UK MHRA for this clinical trial is an important milestone for Videregen and the INSPIRE team, moving this transformative approach to airways disease one stage closer to market. The consortium approach, bringing together expertise from the Cell Therapy Catapult, clinician scientists at UCL, NHS Blood and Transplant and the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, has enabled us to make good progress with this exciting project. Innovate UK's funding was an important first step towards the trial, which is critical in transforming trachea replacement from occasional compassionate use to a treatment that could benefit thousands of patients. It also helps to expand the technology into other indications, and the consortium is grateful for Innovate UK's continued support. ","Published: November 4, 2015"

This contradicts recent notions that the right hemisphere interferes with recovery. While the findings will likely not put an immediate end to the debate, they suggest a new direction in treatment. The study, published in the journal Brain, is the first to look at brain structure and gray matter volume when trying to understand how speech is recovered after a stroke. Results show that patients who have regained their voice have increased gray matter volume in the back of their right hemisphere mirroring the location of one of the two left hemisphere speech areas. ""Over the past decade, researchers have increasingly suggested that the right hemisphere interferes with good recovery of language after left hemisphere strokes,"" says the study's senior author, Peter Turkeltaub, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center and director of the aphasia clinic at MedStar National Rehabilitation Network. ""Our results suggest the opposite that right hemisphere compensation improves recovery."" Approximately one-third of stroke survivors lose speech and language a disorder called aphasia and most never fully regain it. Turkeltaub says loss of speech occurs almost exclusively in patients with a left hemisphere stroke roughly 70 percent of people with left hemisphere strokes have language problems. In a group of 32 left-hemisphere stroke survivors, the researchers determined whether increased gray matter volume in the right hemisphere related to better than expected speech abilities, given the individual features of each person's stroke. The researchers enrolled an additional 30 individuals who had not experienced a stroke as a control group. The investigators found that stroke participants who had better than expected speech abilities after their stroke had more gray matter in the back of the right hemisphere compared to stroke patients with worse speech. Those areas of the right hemisphere were also larger in the stroke survivors than in the control group, Turkeltaub says. ""This indicates growth in these brain areas that relates to better speech production after a stroke."" Turkeltaub, a member of the Center for Brain Plasticity and Recovery at Georgetown University and MedStar National Rehabilitation Network, and his colleagues are continuing their study, looking for areas that compensate for other aspects of language use, such as comprehension of speech.

Individuals who carry this  4 variant of APOE are at increased risk for developing Alzheimer s disease, early age of Alzheimer s disease onset, and more rapid progression of Alzheimer s disease symptoms. APOE  4 has also been associated with atherosclerosis as well as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. A new study published in the November issue of Biological Psychiatry suggests that even when controlling for the risk for Alzheimer s disease, the APOE  4 allele also conveys an increased risk for late-life depression. In the study, researchers examined the relationship between APOE  4 and depression in a large population-based sample of 839 older Swedish adults followed over 5 years.  In our study, the presence of the APOE  4 predicted future depression, even after excluding individuals who later developed dementia,  explained corresponding author Dr. Silke Kern at the University of Gothenburg.  It was also related to dementia. APOE  4 might be a marker for identifying older persons at risk to develop depression or dementia, which could be important for prevention and early detection of these common disorders.   Late-life depression is an under-appreciated source of distress and disability in older people,  said Dr. John Krystal, Editor of Biological Psychiatry.

The findings, which appear in the journal Current Biology, contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying our ability to navigate our environment. In recent decades, researchers have discovered brain cells that establish our location (place cells), direction (head direction cells) and paths through the environment (grid cells), and that together guide our navigation. Place cells and grid cells are part of the brain's ""inner GPS,"" which tracks our location within the environment. Specifically, grid cells fire relative to multiple locations and form a repeating grid-like lattice that covers the entire environment. In their new study, Dartmouth researchers studied the relationship of theta rhythm (an EEG activity generated by the brain) and grid cell function. Theta rhythm is necessary for grid cells to express their repeating pattern of activity. But the information conveyed by theta rhythm is not fully understood. For example, theta rhythm is controlled by the speed of an animal, and faster movement is associated with faster and stronger theta rhythm. The researchers wanted to know what was important about theta is rhythmic activity sufficient or does the rhythm need to be modulated by the animal's speed? The researchers found that moving an animal around in a clear cart on wheels (like pushing someone around in a wheel chair) eliminated grid cell firing patterns. Simultaneously, the animal's movement velocity no longer modulated theta rhythm activity, but left it at a low static level that was comparable to low movement velocity. Therefore, rhythmic activity was spared but was insufficient to support grid cell activity. Thus, the velocity modulation of theta rhythm conveys some critical information for the generation of the grid cell signal. ""This is important because it provides insight into the functional role of grid cells in navigation,"" says Professor Jeffrey Taube, the study's senior author. ""Current opinion is that grid cells actively track the animal's location and provide the neural computations to support GPS-like activity. Our results, however, suggest grid cells may be more involved in tracking the distance traveled by an animal rather than their precise location within the environment."" A better understanding of how the brain processes spatial information and memory may improve diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, says lead author Shawn Winter, a postdoctoral fellow in Psychological and Brain Sciences. For example, in Alzheimer's disease, memory loss may result from degeneration of the hippocampus, which receives direct input from grid cells. Wandering behavior may result from degeneration of the entorhinal cortex, the brain area where grid cells are found. Therefore, drugs may be targeted at the entorhinal cortex to alleviate some of the wandering behavior. Dartmouth College Taube JS et al.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/increasing-vitamin-d-supplementation-198100,Increasing Vitamin D Supplementation New study from ETH Zurich finds that elderly women should consume more vitamin D than previously recommended during the winter months  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Osteoporosis is one of the main reasons why the elderly often suffer fractures from relatively minor injuries. Postmenopausal women in particular experience a relatively rapid loss in bone mass due to a reduced concentration of oestrogen, which is responsible for strong bone growth during youth. Maintaining bone mass requires physical exercise and vitamin D, which is mainly produced in the skin with the help of UVB radiation. This is why, especially in the wintertime, many elderly women are prescribed a vitamin D supplement by their doctor to maintain bone mass. When it comes to determining the correct dosage, however, this mineral is the topic of more expert debate than any other nutrient. One camp believes that sunlight alone is enough to provide the body with sufficient vitamin D, and therefore only small quantities of supplements are necessary. The other asserts that it takes high doses of vitamin D supplements to prevent or slow down bone degeneration in elderly women. How much is enough?A group of researchers at ETH Zurich and the Universities of Zurich and Bern led by ETH Professor for Human Nutrition Michael B. Zimmermann took a closer look at this question. The team of scientists wanted to find out how much vitamin D there needs to be in the bloodstream to maintain bone strength. Surprisingly, the results of their study have come out clearly in favour of higher supplement doses. Particularly in the wintertime, much higher dosages of vitamin D are necessary than previously assumed in order to maintain bone health. In the study, the researchers come to the conclusion that a vitamin D concentration of 40 micrograms per litre of serum in the bloodstream is ideal for slowing or preventing bone degeneration in postmenopausal women. During the study, test participants were first given a single dose of calcium-41. This disperses like normal calcium throughout the body and into the bones and, given enough time, will mark the entire skeletal system evenly.  It s after about six months that things get interesting, because from that point on we can trace the absorption and depletion of calcium in the bones,  says Zimmermann. However, highly sensitive measuring equipment is required to detect the minute quantities of calcium-41 present. Researchers took urine samples from test participants at regular intervals and then used highly sensitive accelerator mass spectrometry equipment   which is found at ETH Zurich s Laboratory for Ion Beam Physics and just a handful of other facilities worldwide   to measure the quantities of calcium-41 and calcium-40 and determine the ratio between them. To put it simply, a very low ratio means more calcium is being added to the bones than released; a high one means the bones are releasing more calcium than they are taking up. Increased calcium absorptionOver a period of nine months beginning half a year after the calcium-41 marking of their bones, the women were given daily vitamin D supplements. The first dose was administered in early spring, when the vitamin D concentration in the blood is expected to be at its lowest, and the dosage was increased stepwise every three months. In addition, the scientists led by Zimmermann modelled the paths the calcium took through the various segments of the body in order to calculate an ideal vitamin D quantity. At the beginning of the experiment, participants showed a vitamin D concentration of 16 micrograms per litre of serum, which indicates  a deficiency. By the end of study, the average vitamin D concentration in their serum had risen to over 46 micrograms per litre. This can be attributed to the vitamin D supplementation  and increased sunlight exposure, over the course of the study which is expected to promote the body s natural vitamin D production. At the same time, the researchers noted that the ratio of calcium-41 to calcium-40 decreased abruptly following the start of the supplementation regimen   a sure sign that bone degeneration had been reduced. Increasing vitamin D supplementation Experts are divided as to the ideal daily dose of vitamin D for maintaining bone mass,  says Zimmermann. This study has provided important new insights with respect to this topic. For healthy postmenopausal women with sufficient calcium absorption and physical activity, a serum concentration of around 40 micrograms of vitamin D per litre of serum has the optimum effect on bone calcium absorption.  That the figure was so high was surprising,  says Zimmermann,  as previously I  tended to believe that a lower dose of vitamin D was sufficient.  In principle the body creates vitamin D in the form of cholecalciferol within the skin itself. But for this to occur, the body needs to be exposed to a sufficient amount of sunlight. In the winter months the sun is too low in the sky, beyond the 40th latitude, which prohibits the body s natural vitamin D production. Only a few food types, such as cod liver oil or saltwater fish, contain larger quantities of natural vitamin D; smaller quantities can be found in eggs, meats, milk and butter. Vegetables, nuts and fruits contain only very little if any vitamin D. Not only is this vital nutrient necessary for optimum uptake of calcium in the bones, it also controls countless important cellular and immune processes. One example of severe vitamin D deficiency is rickets, which causes skeletal deformation.

The discovery is detailed in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Online Early Edition, publishing the week of October 26 in advance of print. ""Ice crystals are ubiquitous and could hold the answer to some very important, fundamental questions about our environment, but until now we haven t had the tools to reliably reproduce ice crystal faces in a lab for study,"" said Mary Jane Shultz, Ph.D., professor of chemistry in the School of Arts and Sciences at Tufts University. ""This new process will open the door to areas of research that have been closed to us previously."" The discovery could, for example, enable researchers to better understand how vapor interacts with ice crystals in a cloud to produce rain, which pollutants attach themselves to ice crystals and why no two snowflakes are alike, said Shultz, principal investigator of the Laboratory for Water and Surface Analysis. Those answers could have implications for important issues such as seeding rain clouds and protecting the environment. Scientists have been pursuing a reliable way to prepare ice crystal surfaces in the laboratory since at least the 1930s, according to Shultz, and she began trying more than 15 years ago. ""I thought I d grow a piece of ice and be done, but it s a very unusual material and challenging to work with. Previous methods of growing and preparing crystals were not reliable and yielded results that were not reproducible."" These limitations hindered scientists  ability to examine the molecular-level structure and dynamics of ice. That has left gaps in our understanding of the important role that ice plays in the environment, such as transporting substances through outer space, shaping the earth s surface and processing ozone-damaging molecules in the stratosphere. In 2013, Shultz s lab took a giant step toward removing these limitations by inventing a special apparatus to grow large samples of single-crystal ice. But selecting a specific face from that ice remained elusive. Shultz credits her most recent breakthrough to simple geometry and trigonometry. The most common type of ice, called Ih or ""ice one h,"" is made up of water molecules in a hexagonal crystal shape in an orderly, repeating arrangement called a lattice. Shultz found that by using certain measurements and formulas, she could determine the crystal s lattice orientation as it relates to a surface and use that orientation to make precise cuts of any of the crystal s faces. The ability to select a desired face is important because it allows researchers to examine molecular-level dynamics and structure and the way in which other molecules bind to the specific faces of the crystal, she said. Shultz, who is considered a pioneer in the study of aqueous surfaces and interactions of high powered laser light with those surfaces, is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Chemical Society.

This collaboration, which started in 2014, has resulted in SynAging s highly reproducible neuroprotection assays on human neurons for drug developers in AD and PD. MTI-GlobalStem provided know-how and materials for the generation of differentiated human neurons in multiwell plates, while SynAging initially characterized the resulting mixed neuronal culture composition, looking at neuronal and glial marker expression. SynAging has subsequently developed assays which treat these human neuronal cultures with its established amyloid beta oligomers (AbO) and alpha-synuclein oligomers (aSO) that have well established neurodegenerative properties in rodent primary neurons, mimicking AD and PD, respectively. Highly reproducible neurodegeneration is induced rapidly in these human cultures and neurons are rescued in a dose dependent manner - e.g. by BDNF, a known blocker of neuronal apoptosis. Dr. Thierry Pillot, CEO and CSO of SynAging, commented:  This new assay system allows our clients to test their drug candidates on human neurons and targets first. Thus very early in drug discovery  on human target  effects can be validated in vitro, including in target knockdown experiments, reducing the downstream risks in development. As is the case with our rodent cultures, the in vitro assays with human neurons permit an initial evaluation of disease modifying properties of novel compounds prior to potential evaluation in our well established in vivo mouse cognition models. We are very grateful to MTI-GlobalStem for their enthusiasm and support of this joint project!  Dr. Jonathan Auerbach, CTO of MTI-GlobalStem Inc. replied:  It was a pleasure working with Thierry and his team at SynAging. They performed very thorough and valuable work using our human iPSC-derived (HIPTM) neurons. We are very excited by their success as this is true validation of the utility of our HIPTM Neuron platform for use in drug development and screening. SynAging s results, together with functional synaptic, electrophysiological and imaging data from other collaborators and our own R&D team, demonstrate the strength and relevance of this system.

The Eurostars grant will enable Hercules to advance CB7993113, a novel non-toxic targeted anti-cancer drug, through pre-clinical development towards clinical trials in cancer patients. The development work will be done by a Dutch-English-Finnish-Danish-French consortium of specialist life-science companies and with researchers at Boston University in the U.S. Hercules  lead product, CB7993113, attacks tumors in three synergistic ways. Firstly, by inhibiting the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR), CB7993113 blocks spreading of the tumor via a direct effect on AHR positive tumor cells. Secondly, it reduces the number and function of Cancer Stem Cells, which are a type of cancer cells that resist chemotherapy and often cause metastasis and relapse of cancer even after  successful  treatment. Thirdly, CB7993113 may enhance tumor-specific immune response, which are dampened by the cancer itself. In this regard, CB7993113 is likely to act in a fashion similar to that of Check-Point inhibitors, a class of highly effective anti-cancer drugs. CB7993113 has shown efficacy in in-vivo cancer models in which it dramatically improved survival from 25% to 90% and inhibited tumor metastasis. Once proven to be safe for human use, the drug may be tested in patients with carcinomas including TNBC, for which there is a critical unmet medical need. Professor David Sherr, founder of Hercules comments:  I m delighted about this grant which allows us to further develop our novel approach to treating cancer. Our lab demonstrated that the AhR plays a crucial role in driving cancer cell metastasis, resistance to therapy, and suppression of tumor-specific immune responses. Therefore we are fully committed to our mission of developing drugs targeted to this cancer Achilles heel, that would offer hope for the treatment of some of the most aggressive cancers including triple negative breast cancer.

In a stress regulation test using the cortisone drug dexamethasone, men with hypersexual disorder showed higher levels of stress hormones than controls, a finding that the researchers hope will contribute to improved therapy for this patient group. The results are published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology. Hypersexual disorder, or an overactive sex drive, normally entails obsessive thoughts of sex, a compulsion to perform sexual acts, a loss of control, or sexual habits that carry potential problems or risks. The diagnosis is not uncontroversial, however, since there is often co-morbidity with another kind of mental health issue. Psychiatrist and researcher Jussi Jokinen has spent many years trying to find the neurobiological causes of mental illness. In the present study, he and his group at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Clinical Neuroscience have used what is known as a dexamethasone test to measure the patients' stress systems. Dexamethasone is a cortisone drug used for depressing the immune system, such as during an anaphylactic shock or an organ transplant; it also serves, however, as a kind of chemical stress test. The study involved 67 men with hypersexual disorder and 39 healthy matched controls. The participants were carefully diagnosed for hypersexual disorder and any co-morbidity with depression or childhood trauma. The researchers gave them a low dose of dexamethasone on the evening before the test to inhibit their physiological stress response, and then in the morning measured their levels of stress hormones cortisol and ACTH. They found that patients with hypersexual disorder had higher levels of such hormones than the healthy controls, a difference that remained even after controlling for co-morbid depression and childhood trauma. ""Aberrant stress regulation has previously been observed in depressed and suicidal patients as well as in substance abusers,"" says Professor Jokinen. ""In recent years, the focus has been on whether childhood trauma can lead to a dysregulation of the body's stress systems via so-called epigenetic mechanisms, in other words how their psychosocial environments can influence the genes that control these systems."" According to the researchers, the results suggest that the same neurobiological system involved in another type of abuse can apply to people with hypersexual disorder. The next step is to see if the psychotherapy given the patients has helped to normalise their physiological stress response. They also plan to perform epigenetic analyses. ""This is the first study of neurobiological disorders in this particular patient group,"" says Professor Jokinen. ""It's important to study stress systems in patients with different psychiatric diagnoses in order to understand if these biological changes are diagnosis-specific or related to different behaviors, and to take into account the impact that childhood trauma has on later mental health.""

Results show that sleepwalkers were nearly 4 times more likely than controls to report a history of headaches (odds ratio = 3.80) and 10 times more likely to report experiencing migraines (OR = 10.04), after adjusting for potential confounders such as insomnia and depression. Among sleepwalkers with at least one previous sleepwalking episode that involved an injury, 79 percent perceived no pain during the episode, allowing them to remain asleep despite hurting themselves.  Our most surprising result was the lack of pain perception during the sleepwalking episodes,  said principal investigator Dr. R gis Lopez, psychiatrist and sleep medicine specialist at Hospital Gui-de-Chauliac in Montpellier, France.  We report here, for the first time, an analgesia phenomenon associated with sleepwalking.  Study results are published in the November issue of the journal Sleep.Lopez and colleagues Isabelle Jaussent, PhD, and Prof. Yves Dauvilliers conducted the cross-sectional study of 100 healthy control subjects and 100 patients with a diagnosis of sleepwalking, including 55 males and 45 females. Sleepwalkers had a median age of 30 years. Daytime pain complaints were evaluated by a clinician and self-report questionnaires, which assessed lifetime headache frequency and headache characteristics. Forty-seven sleepwalkers reported having experienced at least one injurious sleepwalking episode. Only 10 reported waking immediately due to pain; the other 37 perceived no pain during the episode, but felt pain later in the night or in the morning.  For example, one patient sustained severe fractures after jumping out of a third-floor window while sleepwalking but didn t feel the pain until after waking up later in the night. Another patient broke his leg during a sleepwalking episode in which he climbed onto the roof of his house and fell down, but he didn t wake up until morning.  Our results may help to understand the mechanisms of the sleepwalking episodes,  said Lopez.  We hypothesize that a dissociate state of arousal may modify the components of sleep-wake behavior, consciousness, and also pain perception.  The American Academy of Sleep Medicine reports that sleepwalking or somnambulism is a common sleep disorder that affects up to 4 percent of adults. Classified as a  parasomnia,  which is a group of sleep disorders involving undesirable physical events or experiences, sleepwalking occurs during incomplete awakenings from deep sleep. The sleeper walks and displays other complex behaviors while out of bed. American Academy of Sleep Medicine   press release Lopez R, Jaussent I, Dauvilliers Y.

For more than 30 years it has been said that we should trust our hunches and unconscious knowledge of body language. Yet his work, described in a new journal article, shows that we would be better off consciously relying on a single ""cue,"" such as whether or not a person is plainly thinking hard. But gathering reliable research data is a tricky proposition. To begin with, a set of lies and truths need to be collected. Ideally, participants should not be aware that they are taking part in experiments that are dealing with the subject of truth and lies. So Street and his colleague devised an ingenious and well-intentioned deception of their own that involved hiring a film studio in London and persuading passers-by to be interviewed for a ""documentary"" on tourism. They were told by research assistants placed outside the studio that the film makers were running out of time and asked if, in addition to describing genuine travel experiences, they would talk about places they had not actually visited. Inside the studio, the speakers were then interviewed by a director who they supposed was unaware that they had agreed to lie on film. ""The idea was that they were lying to someone that they could potentially deceive. They were lying on behalf of another person, but the lie was spontaneous and told with an intention to mislead,"" said Street. The sequence of filmed interviews that resulted from the experiment constitutes a valuable body of material that is being made available to other researchers in what is still the relatively new field of human lie detection. For more than 30 years, the standard approach to tapping the unconscious has been to use the ""indirect lie detection"" method. ""People are asked to rate some behavior that is indirectly related to deception,"" explained Street. ""For example, does the speaker appear to be thinking hard or not? The researcher then converts all thinking-hard judgments into lie judgments and all not-thinking-hard judgments into truth judgments."" The fact that these indirect judgments give better accuracy than asking people to directly and explicitly rate statements as truth or lies has been taken as evidence that people have innate, unconscious knowledge about human deception. Street and his co-researcher and author Dr. Daniel Richardson, of University College London, have developed a different explanation, which they explore in their new article in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied. ""Indirect lie detection does not access implicit knowledge, but simply focuses the perceiver on more useful cues,"" write the authors. It is an argument that could have real-world significance, in the training of interrogators, for example. ""There has been a push in the literature suggesting that indirect lie detection works and the reason is that it is unconscious so people should not be making reasoned judgments but relying on their gut feeling,"" said Street. ""But if our account is correct, that is a very bad way to go."" He readily concedes that human lie detection while a fascinating subject requires a great deal more research and is a long way from infallibility. ""Typical accuracy rates are around 54 percent, reaching up to around 60 percent with training. So there is unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all strategy that gives us accuracy rates anything like what we would want in a legal setting. The field needs to start considering how to improve clues to deception, how to prevent raters from using less reliable clues, and to better understand how information about the current context plays into that judgment. ""We often think of nonverbal behavior when we think of deception,"" continued Street. ""But it would be better to focus on the content of the tale people are selling us, and asking if it is consistent with other facts we know. But even then there is a large amount of room for error."" If human lie detection has a long way to go and there is probably a cap on the accuracy that can be achieved, could the polygraph machine fill the gap? No, asserts Street, adding that the British Psychological Society is one body that has dismissed the polygraph as a tool that will never be useful. It purports to work by detecting anxiety. ""But are liars more anxious than truth tellers?"" said Street. ""The reality is no, because often the reason we lie is that to tell the truth would be very difficult and more anxiety-provoking than a lie.""

The underlying processes are considerably more complex than hitherto assumed, as researchers from the Ruhr-Universit t Bochum and Bonn University report in the journal Cell Reports. Two brain states must alternate rhythmically in order for a piece of information to be successfully maintained. When we want to remember a new piece of information for a short time, for example a phone number, working memory is called upon. Different brain regions are involved in this process, including the hippocampus, which is known for its crucial role in long-term memory. The team headed by Prof Dr Nikolai Axmacher from the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience in Bochum and Marcin Leszczynski, researcher in Bochum and at the Department of Epileptology at Bonn University, studied rhythmic activity patterns in the hippocampus while the subjects memorised sequences of numbers or faces. To this end, the team worked with epilepsy patients who had electrodes implanted into the hippocampus for the purpose of surgical planning. Those electrodes enabled the researchers to measure the activity of the region embedded deeply in the brain. While the patients memorised sequences of faces or numbers, the researchers observed two activity states in the hippocampus, which alternated twice per second: an excited and a less excited state. If the rhythmic pattern did not occur in the hippocampus, the patients tended to make mistakes during the task. Based on the activity patterns, the researchers were also able to estimate how many numbers or faces the test subjects could reliably memorise. ""The results show that the brain performs highly complex processes even during seemingly simple tasks,"" says Prof Nikolai Axmacher.

Since there are no effective treatments for the deadly disease, University of California (UC), San Diego researchers have developed a new computational strategy to search for molecules that could be developed into glioblastoma drugs. In mouse models of human glioblastoma, one molecule they found shrank the average tumor size by half. The study is published by Oncotarget. The newly discovered molecule works against glioblastoma by wedging itself in the temporary interface between two proteins whose binding is essential for the tumor's survival and growth. This study is the first to demonstrate successful inhibition of this type of protein, known as a transcription factor. ""Most drugs target stable pockets within proteins, so when we started out, people thought it would be impossible to inhibit the transient interface between two transcription factors,"" said first author Igor Tsigelny, PhD, research scientist at UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, as well as the San Diego Supercomputer Center and Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego. ""But we addressed this challenge and created a new strategy for drug design -- one that we expect many other researchers will immediately begin implementing in the development of drugs that target similar proteins, for the treatment of a variety of diseases."" Transcription factors control which genes are turned ""on"" or ""off"" at any given time. For most people, transcription factors labor ceaselessly in a highly orchestrated system. In glioblastoma, one misfiring transcription factor called OLIG2 keeps cell growth and survival genes ""on"" when they shouldn't be, leading to quick-growing tumors. In order to work, transcription factors must buddy up, with two binding to each other and to DNA at same time. If any of these associations are disrupted, the transcription factor is inhibited. In this study, Tsigelny and team aimed to disrupt the OLIG2 buddy system as a potential treatment for glioblastoma. Based on the known structure of related transcription factors, study co-author Valentina Kouznetsova, PhD, associate project scientist at UC San Diego, developed a computational strategy to search databases of 3D molecular structures for those small molecules that might engage the hotspot between two OLIG2 transcription factors. The team used the Molecular Operation Environment (MOE) program produced by the Chemical Computing Group in Montreal, Canada and high-performance workstations at the San Diego Supercomputer Center to run the search. With this approach, the researchers identified a few molecules that would likely fit the OLIG2 interaction. They then tested the molecules for their ability to kill glioblastoma tumors in the Moores Cancer Center lab of the study's senior author, Santosh Kesari, MD, PhD.

Main component of brain repair after stroke identified Looking at brain tissue from mice, monkeys and humans, scientists have found that a molecule known as growth and differentiation factor 10 (GDF10) is a key player in repair mechanisms following stroke. The findings suggest that GDF10 may be a potential therapy for recovery after stroke.   Study reveals brain mechanism for creating durable memories Rehearsing information immediately after being given it may be all you need to make it a permanent memory, a University of Sussex study suggests. Psychologists found that the same area of the brain activated when laying down a memory is also activated when rehearsing that memory. The findings, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, have implications for any situation in which accurate recall of an event is critical, such as witnessing an accident or crime.   Older beats younger when it comes to correcting mistakes Findings from a new study challenge the notion that older adults always lag behind their younger counterparts when it comes to learning new things. The study shows that older adults were actually better than young adults at correcting their mistakes on a general information quiz. ""The take home message is that there are some things that older adults can learn extremely well, even better than young adults. Correcting their factual errors--all of their errors--is one of them,"" say psychological scientists who conducted the study. ""There is such a negative stereotype about older adults' cognitive abilities but our findings indicate that reality may not be as bleak as the stereotype implies.""

And once these sensors are gone, that s it; the delicate hair cells don t grow back in humans, leading to hearing loss and problems with balance. But scientists hope to find a way to regenerate these cells by examining how they develop in the first place. New research has identified two genes pivotal to the production of hair cells in young mice, who, just like human babies, lose the ability to generate these sensors shortly after birth.

The discovery and characterization of these systems is expected to further expand the genome editing toolbox, opening new avenues for biomedical research. The research, published in the journal Molecular Cell, was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health.  This work shows a path to discovery of novel CRISPR-Cas systems with diverse properties, which are demonstrated here in direct experiments,  said Eugene Koonin, Ph.D., senior investigator at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), National Library of Medicine (NLM), part of the NIH.  The most remarkable aspect of the story is how evolution has achieved a broad repertoire of biological activities, a feat we can take advantage of for new genome manipulation tools.  Enzymes from the CRISPR system are revolutionizing the field of genomics, allowing researchers to target specific regions of the genome and edit DNA at precise locations.  CRISPR  stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, which are key components of a system used by bacteria to defend against invading viruses. Cas9   one of the enzymes produced by the CRISPR system   binds to the DNA in a highly sequence-specific manner and cuts it, allowing precise manipulation of a region of DNA. Enzymes such as Cas9 provide researchers with a gene editing tool that is faster, less expensive and more precise than previously developed methods. The three newly-characterized systems share some features with Cas9 and Cpf1, a recently characterized CRISPR enzyme, but have unique properties that could potentially be exploited for novel genome editing applications. This study highlights the diversity of CRISPR systems, which can be leveraged to develop more efficient, effective, and precise ways to edit DNA. The researchers took a novel bioinformatics approach to discover the new proteins, provisionally termed C2c1, C2c2, and C2c3, developing a series of computational approaches to search NIH genomic databases and identify new CRISPR-Cas systems. In addition to Koonin, the research team included Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, Konstantin Severinov of Rutgers University   New Brunswick and the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Omar Abudayyeh, a graduate student at the Harvard- MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, and NCBI s Kira Makarova, Sergey Shmakov (also at Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology), and Yuri Wolf.  There are multiple ways to modify the search algorithm, so more exciting and distinct CRISPR-Cas mechanisms should be expected soon,  said Severinov.  These new mechanisms will undoubtedly attract the attention of basic and applied scientists alike.  Initial experimental work exploring the function of these proteins reveals that they are substantially different from the well-characterized Cas9 protein, which has been widely used for genome editing. With the analysis of C2c1, C2c2, and C2c3, the team was able to infer the intricate evolutionary pathway of these adaptive defense systems.  The collaborative nature of this work highlights the power of bringing together top scientists with diverse strengths to innovate at the interface of computation, molecular biology and evolutionary biology,  said Zhang. The Koonin and Zhang groups also recently collaborated on a project that resulted in the characterization of Cpf1, a novel CRISPR nuclease that is expected to become an important genome editing tool.

In a new study that will appear in the December 2015 issue of Stroke Journal, the team co-led by Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., and U. Mass Medical Professor of Radiology Ajay Wakhloo, M.D., Ph.D., FAHA, describe their novel method to quickly dissolve away clots that completely obstruct blood vessels in the brain. Their approach combines an injectable clot-busting nanotherapeutic that targets blockages with an intra-arterial device that restores blood flow to obstructed vessels. The Wyss Institute nanotherapeutic is composed of an aggregate of biodegradable nanoparticles coated with a clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which mimics the way blood platelets behave inside our own bodies. When blood vessels narrow, the shear force of blood flow increases at that location to produce a physical cue that causes platelets to stick to the vessel wall. Similarly, the nanotherapeutic reacts to fluid shear force, releasing tPA-coated nanoparticles in these narrowed regions where vessels are partially occluded, binding to the blood clot and dissolving it away. But until now, the mechanically activated nanotherapeutic would not be effective in complete vascular blockages where there is no blood flow, as is the case for most stroke patients. The most effective treatment today for stroke is known as a ""stent-retriever thrombectomy"" procedure, originally described by Wakhloo and his colleague Matthew Gounis, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Radiology at UMass. The procedure involves placing a small tube through the blockage, passing a closed stent through it, and then opening the stent to physically pull the large blood clot out of the vessel. ""Even with the retriever thrombectomy procedure, not all clots can be removed with a successful outcome,"" said Gounis. ""Clot fragments can be dislodged, which can lead to microclots and tissue damage downstream in the brain circulatory system, and physical dragging of the stent through the vessel can potentially be damaging as well."" Instead, the new advance describes using the stent not to drag out the clot, but to create a narrow channel restoring blood flow through an opening in the center of the vascular blockage. Doing so creates a high level of shear force generated by restored flow, activating the nanotherapeutic to release and target the clot-busting drug along the opened channel in the clot. After the blood clot is fully dissolved, the stent is re-sheathed and harmlessly removed from the vessel. If during the process any clot fragments break off and travel away through the circulatory system, the drug-coated nanoparticles will remain bound to them and continue to dissolve them locally wherever they go. ""What's progressive about this approach is that the temporary opening of a tiny hole in the clot   using a stent device that is already commonly used clinically   results in a local rise in mechanical forces that activate the nanotherapeutic to deploy the clot-busting drug precisely where it can best do its job,"" said Ingber, who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. In clinically relevant large animal studies, the team has demonstrated that the drug-device combination works very efficiently, showing that it dissolves clots that fully occlude brain blood vessels that are the same size as they would be in humans. ""This has been a great collaboration between experts in the field of treating stroke and experts in mechanobiology and bioengineering,"" said co-first author of the study Netanel Korin, Ph.D., former Wyss Technology Development Fellow and current Assistant Professor in Biomedical Engineering at the Technion, Israel, who first described the nanotherapeutic in a 2012 Science publication with Ingber. ""We hope that one day it will have a positive impact on patients suffering from a range of medical crises resulting from blood clot occlusions.""","Published: October 31, 2015"

The study suggests that a less common version of the BDNF gene may predispose people to obesity by producing lower levels of BDNF protein, a regulator of appetite, in the brain. The authors propose that boosting BDNF protein levels may offer a therapeutic strategy for people with the genetic variation, which tends to occur more frequently in African Americans and Hispanics, than in non-Hispanic Caucasians. The study is published in the journal Cell Reports. Obesity in children and adults is a serious issue in the United States, contributing to health conditions such as heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. Importantly, genetic factors can predispose a person to obesity, as well as influence the effectiveness of weight-loss strategies. The body relies on cells to process and store energy, and changes in genes that regulate these functions can cause an imbalance that leads to excessive energy storage and weight gain.  The BDNF gene has previously been linked to obesity, and scientists have been working for several years to understand how changes in this particular gene may predispose people to obesity,  said Jack A. Yanovski, M.D., Ph.D., one of the study authors and an investigator at NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).  This study explains how a single genetic change in BDNF influences obesity and may affect BDNF protein levels. Finding people with specific causes of obesity may allow us to evaluate effective, more-personalized treatments.  The BDNF protein plays several roles in the brain and nervous system and, at high levels, the protein can stimulate the feeling of fullness. The study team, led by Joan C. Han, M.D., a former NICHD investigator now at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, first analyzed the BDNF gene for naturally occurring genetic changes that alter levels of BDNF production. After analyzing brain tissue samples, the researchers identified an area of the gene where a single change reduced BDNF levels in the hypothalamus, a key area that controls eating and body weight. The genetic change the researchers identified was not a rare mutation, but rather a variation that occurs in the general population. Every person has two copies, or alleles, of each gene, inheriting one copy from each parent. Alleles can vary at any location across the gene. In their study, the researchers referred to the common allele as  T,  and the less common allele, which produces less BDNF protein, as  C.  Using this information, the researchers studied the BDNF gene in four groups of people, more than 31,000 males and females, enrolled in clinical research studies, including PAGE (link is external), HANDLS and Viva La Familia. They compared a person s BDNF gene combination   CC, CT or TT   to factors that define obesity, such as body mass index (BMI) and percentage of body fat. In African American adults, the team found that the C allele was associated with higher BMI and body fat percentage in those with CT or CC types. In a group of healthy children of many races, the researchers found that CC types had higher BMI scores and percentage of body fat when compared to CT or TT types, who were similar to each other. Finally, in a group of Hispanic children, the researchers found that the C allele (CT, CC types) was associated with a higher BMI score. Overall, the study suggests that the C allele of the BDNF gene may be linked to obesity in people. To understand why the C allele has an effect on obesity, the study team carefully examined the genetic area that differs between C and T alleles. They discovered that the area of interest interacts with a protein called hnRNP D0B. In laboratory experiments, the team found that hnRNP D0B had trouble interacting with the C allele, resulting in less BDNF production.  Lower BDNF levels may contribute to obesity in people with the C allele. If these findings are supported by additional studies, boosting BDNF levels may prove beneficial,  said Dr. Han.","Published: October 31, 2015"

Horvath shares the prize with Jennifer Doudna, professor, Molecular & Cell Biology and Chemistry at Berkeley University of California, and Emmanuelle Charpentier, scientific member and director at the Max Planck Institute in Berlin. The Massry Prize will be presented on Oct. 31 in Beverly Hills, Calif. The laureates were selected by a committee of distinguished professors representing both the University of Southern California (USC) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). A number of Massry Prize recipients have gone on to win the Nobel Prize. Horvath is the first DuPont scientist to receive the award. Horvath s article, published in Science (Barrangou et al., 2007, Science 315, pp. 1709-1712), provided the first biological evidence that CRISPR-Cas constitutes an immunity system against viruses in bacteria. Beginning in the early 2000s, Horvath and colleagues initially utilized CRISPR for bacterial identification, then for its ability to improve the resistance of starter culture strains against bacteriophage attack. The discoveries opened new research avenues and inspired numerous scientists to pursue the CRISPR field.  Today, more than ever before, the world needs scientists to invent and develop new ways to solve global challenges. We are very proud of Philippe and honored to be associated with his receiving the Massry Prize. Philippe epitomizes what it means to innovate at DuPont,  said Douglas Muzyka, DuPont senior vice president and chief science and technology officer.  DuPont s vision is to apply world-class science to enable a better, safer and healthier life for people everywhere. Our scientists provide the knowledge and ingenuity to identify and apply new solutions, like CRISPR-Cas which has tremendous potential to address challenges in a range of scientific fields.   The 2015 Massry Prize recognizes the discovery of a mechanism of bacterial immunity and the unexpected realization that the solution has biomedical implications well beyond the initial expectations of the investigators,  added Shaul G. Massry, M.D., professor emeritus of medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.  And so a revolution began. What started as an obscure problem in commercial microbiology begat a revolution in the modification of animal genomes that will transform understanding of normal development and therapies for a wide range of diseases.  DuPont is a leader in the CRISPR area, with about 60 patents and applications and more than 30 published scientific articles and book chapters. The company leverages CRISPR in at least two distinct ways: DuPont Nutrition & Health takes advantage of the native CRISPR-Cas system to select, through a fully natural process, bacteria that are immunized against bacteriophages. The natural immunization process does not involve gene editing technologies. The use of starter cultures containing such immunized bacteria ultimately improves the quality and safety of fermented dairy foods. DuPont Pioneer utilizes CRISPR-derived tools for genome editing applications, and recently announced collaborations with Caribou Biosciences, a leading developer of CRISPR-Cas technologies for genome editing, and Vilnius University, a research leader in the field. The genome editing technology is capable of making exact changes to the DNA of many organisms. In plants this editing capability can be applied to promote drought tolerance and disease resistance to protect plant health and increase crop yields. It also can eliminate food allergens and improve the nutrient composition of plant-derived oils. CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a feature naturally existing in bacteria providing protection against viruses. DuPont scientists were among the first to understand how the CRISPR system works in bacteria. CRISPR-Cas is one of several CRISPR-derived tools and differs from the natural CRISPR process used to identify and immunize bacteria. The Meira and Shaul G.

Researchers funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation have invited people to their sleep lab for a Dutch language course. You can't learn new things in your sleep. Nevertheless, if you've been learning vocabulary in a foreign language, it can be highly effective to hear these words played over again while you sleep, as was already shown a year ago by researchers from the universities of Zurich and Fribourg. Their new study, funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, demonstrates that this only works if the brain can do its job undisturbed. The researchers got 27 German-speaking test subjects to learn Dutch words, then let them sleep for three hours in the sleep lab. The scientists already knew that playing back this vocabulary softly would help the test subjects to remember the words. Now they wanted to give them more information while they were asleep. The research team, led by biopsychologist Bj rn Rasch from the University of Fribourg, wanted to enhance the technique's impact by supplying German translations after the Dutch words. They also wanted to achieve the opposite in other words, they hoped that supplying incorrect translations would make the test subjects forget what they'd learned. ""To our surprise, we were neither able to enhance their memory, nor able to make them forget what they'd learned,"" says Rasch. He was able to confirm the original findings that simply cueing the Dutch vocabulary during sleep enabled the subjects to recall about ten percent more words. ""But playing a second word right after the first seems to disrupt the relevant memory processes that had hitherto been activated,"" says Rasch. He and his team have concluded that it's not the total information offered to the brain that is important. Instead, the brain just needs a nudge in order to enhance the ability to recall. The results of this memory test were reflected in the brain wave patterns of the test subjects. While individual Dutch words were being played, the researchers recorded an enhancement in the waves characteristic of sleep and recollection (sleep spindles and theta-oscillation). But these activity patterns disappeared completely as soon as another word followed on from the first. In a subsequent experiment, the researchers were also able to demonstrate that the time span between word pairs was of decisive importance. If the German translation followed only after 2 seconds instead of after 0.2 seconds, the disruptive effect disappeared. But there was still no enhancement of impact. ""For us, these results are further evidence that sleep promotes memory formation, with the brain spontaneously activating content that it had learnt beforehand. We were able to enhance this effect by playing back the words,"" says Rasch. It's as yet uncertain whether there will soon be an app to help people get better marks in their vocabulary tests. ""Now we really want to get out of the controlled situation of the sleep lab, to see whether the impact we've observed can also be reproduced under realistic conditions in everyday life,"" he says.

Each neuron has a highly specialized structural region, the axon initial segment (AIS), whose primary role is in the generation and sending of these messages. The AIS can undergo changes in size and location in response to alterations of a neuron's ongoing electrical activity. However, until now, all such 'AIS plasticity' has been exceptionally slow, occurring over a timescale of days. Work by researchers from the MRC Centre for Developmental Neurobiology (MRC CDN) at King's College London, has found that AIS plasticity can happen quickly, influencing the way cells fire action potentials. These results were published in the online edition of the journal Cell Reports. Located near the start of the axon, the neuron's major output structure, the AIS has a crucial role in kick-starting communication between brain cells. However, for AIS plasticity to play a more prominent role in the brain's responses to altered activity, the structure needs to be able to change far more quickly than was previously shown. For this reason, Evans, Dumitrescu and colleagues decided to investigate how rapidly an AIS could be altered. Using a technique called 'optogenetics', which allows precise control of neuronal activity with light, they discovered that 3 hours after elevating neuronal activity, the AIS of hippocampal neurons in culture was shortened by approximately 25%. ""We knew this part of a neuron could change, but we had no idea it could happen as rapidly as this. Something that takes a brain cell 3 hours might not sound especially fast, but for a big structure like the AIS, it really is surprisingly quick!,"" said senior author Matthew Grubb. What does a shorter AIS mean for the function of a neuron? The researchers expected that these neurons would be less excitable and therefore would send fewer action potentials. However, to their surprise, after 3 hours of sustained neuronal activation, neurons with shorter AISs were functionally indistinguishable from their unstimulated counterparts. It turned out that a second form of plasticity was also in action at the same time as AIS shortening, involving molecular alterations to the proteins that drive action potential generation -- voltage-gated sodium channels. This sodium channel modulation acted to balance out any neuronal excitability changes caused by AIS shortening. ""I was surprised to discover that AIS shortening did not immediately lead to a reduction neuronal excitability. The interplay between AIS shortening and sodium channel modulation was a fascinating lesson in the ability of a neuron to balance its levels of excitability.,"" said Mark Evans, co-first author of the study."" Once the researchers re-set this second form of plasticity using a cocktail of specific drugs, the functional effects of rapid AIS plasticity became clear. They found that changes in AIS length were now associated with alterations in neurons' action potential firing responses: a neuron with a shorter AIS was less excitable and sent less action potentials. Their discovery is the clearest demonstration to date that AIS structure determines neuronal function. ""These findings reveal another mechanism of plasticity a neuron can use to regulate its excitability within hours. How this form of plasticity integrates with other plasticity mechanisms will be an intriguing area of future study"" added Evans. The results suggest that brain cells can rapidly alter their structure to fine-tune their function. Since a shorter AIS is associated with decreased electrical excitability in neurons, it could represent a form of adaptation, or 'homeostasis': when neuronal activity is too high in a network, for instance during the early development of the brain, cells shorten their AIS, become less excitable, send fewer action potentials, and thereby return the network to normal levels of activity. This could prove to be an important factor in the brain's responses to perturbed activity, allowing ongoing maintenance of appropriate levels of electrical signalling, even when the inputs to a network have been significantly altered, which might happen in diseases such as epilepsy and bipolar disorder. ""This work adds a bit of data to confirm the 'biology is messy' dictum. We saw shorter AISs and automatically assumed that our experiments would prove that this results in an excitability reduction. It took some intellectual head scratching and extra experiments to figure out that sodium channels were modulated by a separate pathway and actively counteracted the AIS shortening phenotype. We showed what the plasticity potential is in an in vitro context; it would be interesting to study whether it can be replicated in vivo next."" concluded Adna Dumitriescu, co-author of the study. These findings open the door to future studies on the intracellular molecular pathways controlling AIS plasticity and other forms of plasticity that interact with it. Uncovering these might lead to the discovery of novel targets for drugs that could allow precise control over neuronal excitability, with potential uses in psychiatric disorders.

In a study of 64 patients with MS, kinesiology and community health professor Lara Pilutti and her colleagues found that participants had significantly higher peak aerobic capacity and muscle strength when recumbent steppers and computerized dynamometers were used for the tests, compared with arm ergometers and handheld dynamometers. Participants' muscle strength ranged from 60 to 173 percent greater, depending on the leg muscle group tested, when measured with a computerized dynamometer versus a handheld device. Accordingly, participants' peak aerobic capacity was 32 percent greater when tested with a recumbent stepper versus an arm ergometer, an upper-body exercise machine that is similar to pedaling a bike with one's hands. Computerized dynamometers measure the amount of torque or muscle force that users exert to move a lever with their legs. The accuracy of handheld dynamometers in muscle-strength testing has been challenged in prior research because the results can vary greatly, depending on the strength of the person administering the test and providing the resistance as the participant pushes against the device, Pilutti said. Participants in the study ranged in age from 18 to 64 and had mobility disabilities from MS that varied from mild to severe. Published in the Journal of Neurologic Physical Therapy, the paper is believed to be the first study to evaluate the use of computerized dynamometers in testing strength deficits in people who have severe mobility impairments from advanced MS. People who have the most significant disability from the disease frequently are excluded from research studies, either because facilities lack the necessary adaptive equipment or because of other barriers to exercise participation, such as transportation problems. However, people with the most disabling symptoms could reap great benefits from exercise training, Pilutti said. For the 2.5 million people worldwide who have MS, appropriate exercise can help manage many symptoms of the disease, including fatigue, muscle weakness and problems with balance and coordination. Sedentary behavior is a significant health threat among people with MS, who, like their counterparts in the general population, spend an average of about eight hours each day sitting, the researchers found. ""We know there are some serious health consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality, so inactivity is a pretty significant issue,"" Pilutti said. ""We need to develop some interventions for both people with MS and in the general population to get everyone to be more active. But that's going to be a challenge for people who have more severe mobility disabilities."" University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign   Original reporting by: Sharita Forrest Motl RW et al.

Salk Institute researchers have uncovered evidence of a dedicated neural pathway that transmits the itchy feeling triggered by such a light touch. Surprisingly, the spinal neurons involved in the tingling sensation caused by a light touch are different from those transmitting pain or a 'chemical' itch, the latter elicited by a mosquito bite or a skin wound that is healing. Published in the journal Science, the new results lend insights into potential mechanisms of chronic itch, which is caused by a variety of conditions such as eczema, diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis and certain types of cancers. It may also help explain why some people affected by itch are unresponsive to commonly used antihistamine drugs. ""This is the first study that reveals the presence of a dedicated neural pathway for this particular sensation in the spinal cord,"" says co-senior author and Salk Professor Martyn Goulding. Overactivation of this pathway, which most likely evolved to detect the presence of disease-bearing insects on the skin, results in increased scratching akin to that seen in patients who develop chronic itch. The spinal cord contains a variety of neurons called interneurons or ""middlemen"" that process and relay sensory information from the body including the skin. The team found that some of these ""middlemen"" express a small protein called neuropeptide Y, or NPY for short. This neurotransmitter is present throughout the brain and has several functions, but until now, no one knew what NPY neurons did in the spinal cord. In the new study, Goulding's team, working with researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, selectively eliminated the NPY neurons in the spinal cord of adult mice. Within a week, of removing those inhibitory interneurons from the spinal cord, the mice showed excessive scratching in response to light touch without any effect on their response to chemically-induced itch or pain. ""This was one of the most surprising things we found,"" says co-lead author Steeve Bourane, a Salk research scientist in Goulding's lab. The group saw similar behaviors when they used a chemical genetic strategy to silence the NPY expressing interneurons that prevents them from communicating with the presumptive neurons that transmit this form of itch. The fact that the NPY-deficient mice were no more sensitive than controls to more forceful forms of touch and painful stimuli, or even to chemicals that evoke itchiness, suggests light touch uses its own pathway in the nervous system to evoke scratching. Interestingly, by recording the electrical activity in the spinal cords of mice depleted of NPY interneurons, the researchers discovered that the NPY neurons seem to selectively inhibit or gate light touch signals coming from hairy skin, but not the non-hairy (glabrous) skin, such as the skin found on your palm. ""That means there's probably two different spinal touch sensory circuits, one for the glabrous skin and one for the hairy skin,"" Bourane says. A Cell study published by Goulding's group earlier this year identified another player in the light-touch circuit: ROR  neurons. The scientists are pursuing additional studies to map the entire chain of neurons that activate scratching in response to light touch--something that has been overlooked in the field of chronic itch until now, the team says. ""In the future, maybe we can specifically manipulate or modify the activity of these neurons to help people with chronic itch,"" Bourane adds. Salk Institute   press release Goulding M et al.

The scientists from both institutes used large-scale genomic data of breast cancers, demonstrating the use of computational techniques to increase understanding of diseases and improve patient treatments. Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer diagnosed amongst women, with an estimated 1.67 million new cancer cases worldwide in 2012. In Singapore, more than 9,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2010 and 2014. Breast cancer is also the leading cause of cancer death in females locally. - Improving classification and treatment of prevalent type breast cancer - The BII scientists identified and characterized two new major classes of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), which comprise about 80% of all breast cancers. The increased knowledge of these genetically and clinically distinct classes will improve the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of IDC, paving the way for personalised treatment with better patient outcomes (See Annex A). Employing integrative bioinformatics and analyses, the scientists found that the intermediate grade (histologic grade 2) - assigned to approximately 50% of IDC cases - did not exist at the molecular level. IDC tumours in this grade would be better classified under the two major classes described, to enable better prediction of disease outcomes and for optimal treatment to be assigned. - Identifying new targets for treatment of aggressive breast cancer - In a separate study, scientists from GIS discovered a molecular mechanism that can be targeted to treat a more aggressive type of breast cancer, called triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The researchers identified a crucial protein whose increased activity promotes breast cancer metastasis and resistance to paclitaxel, a first line chemotherapeutic agent to treat breast cancer. Additionally, treating this pathway may also contribute to the prevention of tumour recurrence, which is the main reason for breast cancer patient mortality. While increased awareness of the need for early detection has led to improved survival in breast cancer patients, the development of improved treatment strategies remains important to further reduce mortality rates. Dr Benjamin Seet, Executive Director of A*STAR's Biomedical Research Council, said, ""These findings advance our understanding of breast cancer, which is the most common cancer affecting women in Singapore. More importantly, it allows us to develop precise and effective treatment strategies for these particular types of breast cancer, as well as to discover new drugs for the patients who do not get better.""","Published: October 30, 2015"

We are transitioning to the third platform where both people and their data are mobile, apps and users number in the millions and interact through new social outlets, Big Data is needed to explore these social interconnections, and cloud services are what enable it all.  IDC s Third Platform Applied to Storage While IDC s model shows the general direction of IT technology, the model also applies to data storage.  The first platform used block based direct attached storage, the second platform is based on networked storage, which brings us to the third storage platform, object storage. Infinite scalability and rich metadata, along with the ability to store very large collections of unstructured data enables collaboration - a key premise for the third platform. Object Storage in Healthcare and Life Sciences Enterprise Content Management in Healthcare Healthcare IT continues to transition to electronic health records (EHR) ahead of regulatory deadlines.  In clinical environments, data resides in so many locations and in so many different formats that the true value of the data cannot be realized easily. On top of this, a clinician needs to have instant access to test results and patient information from anywhere and at anytime.   Current EHR solutions are good for capturing and organizing patient information within a hospital environment, but they are not designed to organize data across the many systems found in a healthcare network, let alone dissimilar systems used by service partners.  This is the pain point that Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems such as Hyland's OnBase and others are targeting.  An ECM system is able to aggregate patient information across varied repositories, making it searchable and accessible. An object storage-backed ECM supports anywhere, anytime access across platforms regardless of file type. Genomics and Object Storage The promise of personalized medicine is fueling significant investment in the field of genomics. With each run, genome sequencers create massive amounts of test data that must be stored and analyzed.  Current Next-Generation Sequencers (NGS) are able to run tests in hours instead of days, allowing researchers to run more tests in less time. To drive this point home, consider a sequencing system that can process approximately 18,000 whole genomes per year. Now, multiply that by file sizes that can easily reach 80-90 terabytes and it s obvious that data storage quickly becomes a choke point inhibiting scientific progress.   Admittedly, this is an extreme case given the sequencer s hefty price tag (don t expect to see one of these on your next visit to the doctor). Still, it is not uncommon for researchers to generate between 10 and 30 terabytes of data per day, enough to quickly consume a high-end storage array. Researchers must choose between keeping the data and moving it to cheaper, slower storage.  Many organizations are seriously considering cloud storage as an alternative to expensive, high performance disk arrays.   I don t know about you, but I can t imagine routinely moving several days  worth of test data across a wide area network, fat pipe or not. Data transfer is both time consuming and expensive, and it represents a security risk. Illumina recently introduced BaseSpace, allowing its sequencers to transfer raw sequence data directly to Amazon s object storage service via an S3 interface. This is a step forward in terms of storing large data sets, and you can expect the sequencing industry as a whole to rapidly follow suit. However, with a limited research budget it makes sense to deploy a flexible storage architecture, one that scales well and can support public, private and hybrid clouds. The benefits are the ability to store data locally in cases requiring improved performance and security, as well as the ability to support collaboration with remote partners. Object storage systems can disperse data both locally and to remote data centers; this greatly reduces the risk of data loss and eliminates the expense of replication software or a dedicated disaster recovery system.  The Joining of Forces Given the different workflows and performance needs of Heathcare and Life Sciences, it seems unlikely that one storage platform could support both segments. However, the benefits of personalized medicine cannot be achieved until the gap is bridged between genomics research and clinical practice.  In fact, the National Institute of Health (NIH) recently committed $48M in research grants to integrate genomic information into EHRs in a bid to prepare EHRs and the healthcare system for precision medicine.  Couple this with the government s recently published Heath IT Strategic Plan calling for healthcare IT systems to support personal monitoring devices such as Fitbit and Smartphone apps and you can see where things are heading   lots of data streaming from multiple sources continuously.  Talk about an IoT data deluge. The question becomes, will your storage system support the needs of the third platform?

The group, called the Unified Microbiome Initiative Consortium (UMIC), envisions that a coordinated effort would drive forward cutting edge microbiome research, enabling breakthrough advances across medicine, ecosystem management, sustainable energy and production of commodities. Their proposal was published online in the journal Science on October 28. Microbial life forms including viruses, bacteria and fungi are the most diverse and abundant organisms on earth. They have shaped our evolutionary origins for billions of years and continue to have widespread impact on the planet, its environment and the species inhabiting it. Together, they make up microbiomes that influence each other, the environment, and the host organisms that these microbial communities thrive in. The UMIC foresees that the microbiomes populating our planet and its many diverse species and environments could be leveraged through genetic engineering for applications that improve the greater good, and that many milestones could be reached on this front within ten years. ""Microbes are everywhere. Therefore understanding microbiomes, whether they be the ones that live in and on our bodies or the ones in the environment, is essential to understanding life,"" said Silver, who in addition to being one of the faculty leaders on the Wyss Institute's Synthetic Biology platform, is also the Elliot T. and Onie H. Adams Professor of Biochemistry and Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and a founding member of the Department of Systems Biology at HMS. The UMIC consists of leading microbiologists, ecologists, physical scientists, engineers, and scientists in the emerging field of synthetic biology. The group coalesced during a series of coordinated but separately convened meetings held by The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and The Kavli Foundation. The proposal in Science got its roots from the UMIC's efforts to identify challenges and opportunities in microbiome research as well as their strategic recommendations for accelerating discovery that emerged from these meetings. ""Understanding how [microbiomes] work might hold the key to advances as diverse as fighting antibiotic resistance and autoimmune diseases, reclaiming ravaged farmland, reducing fertilizer and pesticide use, and converting sunlight into useful chemicals,"" said Jeff F. Miller, Ph.D., Director of the California NanoSystems Institute and corresponding author of the Science paper. By metabolic processes, microbes synthesize countless different molecules, which through genetic engineering could lead to colonies of microbial ""workers"" being used for the sustainable synthesis of pharmaceuticals, materials and chemical commodities. Genetically engineered microbes could also produce biofuels through metabolic processes and conversion of solar energy into liquid fuel, according to work already underway by Silver at the Wyss Institute and HMS. Microbes also play a vital role in balancing biogeochemical processes, such as removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The interactions between soil, plant roots and microbes play an important role in plant health and crop yield. Furthermore, the microbiomes in our gastrointestinal tracts regulate wide-ranging physiological, metabolic, immunologic, cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric traits. Understanding and manipulating human microbiomes could be key to managing physical and mental health. Silver and her team have already begun developing several potential avenues for leveraging gut microbes to improve health. In collaboration with Wyss Core Faculty member James Collins, Ph.D., Silver has engineered genetically programmed bacterial ""reporters"" that can detect and record conditions in the gastrointestinal tract. And, working with Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., and Wyss Institute Senior Staff Scientist Jeffrey Way, Ph.D., Silver is developing consortia of synthetic microbes that could be used to treat gastrointestinal illness. Her expertise and experience in these emerging areas of synthetic biology has enabled Silver to contribute her thought leadership as a member of the UMIC to how the proposed Unified Microbiome Initiative could integrate focus areas to accelerate microbiome research. ""I'm interested in engineering microbes as a way to interrogate their behavior,"" said Silver. ""The purpose of this unified initiative is to determine what are the big questions we have about the microbiome and what are the specific technologies we need in order to investigate those questions."" Some of the big questions the group hopes to address through an organized coalition include understanding how microbes assemble into communities and what makes them resilient or resistant to perturbation, how genes in the microbiome interact with one another, which genes in the microbiome are associated with which organisms, as well as how we can beneficially harness the microbiomes of humans, animals, plants and environments. To find the answers to these questions, scientists must first be supported in the development of breakthrough technologies for investigating microbiomes. Specifically, the group recommends development of improved computational methods for analyzing and predicting the vast number of unknown genes and their functions comprising microbiomes; a transition from gene-specific to whole-genome based analysis through improved genome reference libraries and sequencing methods; developing high-powered imaging methods for visually interrogating communities of microbes down to the individual level; new adaptive modeling systems and data reporting tools; improved genetic engineering techniques for perturbing microbial communities; and novel methods to mimic natural environments for supporting microbiome growth in the laboratory, among others. ""Discovery of the existence and importance of the microbiome has provided a new frame of reference for our understanding of health and our environment,"" said Ingber, who in addition to directing the Wyss Institute is the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at HMS and Boston Children's Hospital and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. ""A nation-wide coordinated effort to invest in understanding and leveraging microbiomes could open entirely new frontiers in biotechnology and medicine, and lead to solutions that would not be possible in any other way.""

The study shows that older adults were actually better than young adults at correcting their mistakes on a general information quiz. ""The take home message is that there are some things that older adults can learn extremely well, even better than young adults. Correcting their factual errors--all of their errors--is one of them,"" say psychological scientists Janet Metcalfe and David Friedman of Columbia University, who conducted the study. ""There is such a negative stereotype about older adults' cognitive abilities but our findings indicate that reality may not be as bleak as the stereotype implies."" Metcalfe, Friedman, and colleagues were interested in exploring a phenomenon known as the ""hypercorrection effect."" According to the effect, when people are very confident about an answer that turns out to be wrong, they tend to correct it; when they're initially unsure about the answer, however, they're less likely to correct it. Previous research has shown that the effect is robust in college students and children, but not as strong in older adults. It's possible that older adults don't show a strong hypercorrection effect because they're not very good at correcting so-called ""high-confidence errors."" But it could also be that the effect doesn't emerge for older adults because they're actually better than young adults at correcting low-confidence errors. The researchers wanted to put these possibilities to the test, using both behavioral measures and measures of brain activity to understand participants' performance. They recruited 44 young adults (around 24 years old) and 45 older adults (around 74 years old) to participate in the study. None of the participants had any history or symptoms of neurological or psychiatric disorder or impairment. The participants were fitted with an EEG cap and presented with a series of general information questions that covered a variety of topics (e.g., ""In what ancient city were the Hanging Gardens located?""); they were encouraged to guess when they were unsure but they were allowed to say ""I don't know."" The participants were asked to rate how confident they were in their response on a 7-point scale, and were then given the correct answer (e.g., Babylon). The brain's electrical activity was measured while the corrective feedback was displayed. This process continued until the participant had made errors on at least 20 high-confidence and 20 low-confidence answers--on average, this required about 244 questions for the older adults and about 230 questions for the younger adults. The EEG cap was removed and participants were given a surprise retest. The retest included 20 questions that had led to high-confidence errors, 20 questions that resulted in low-confidence errors, and 20 questions that were not answered. As expected, the results showed that older adults were better at answering the general knowledge questions on average, they answered 41% of the questions correctly, while the young adults got only 26% right. Older adults also tended to be more confident in their answers, but both age groups reported greater confidence in the answers they ended up getting right than the ones that they got wrong. The findings showed that older adults corrected more errors overall than the young adults did, indicating that they were better at updating their existing knowledge with new information. More importantly, they also corrected more of their low-confidence errors. Together, these findings indicate that the older adults were less susceptible to the hypercorrection effect than younger adults were. And these behavioral results were mirrored by the participants' brain activity. Both age groups showed a larger P3a component a brain wave indicating attentional processing--for feedback on high-confidence errors than for feedback on low-confidence errors. But, relative to the young adults, older adults produced a larger P3a to low-confidence-error feedback. According to the researchers, this pattern of results suggests a focus of attention that reflects the older adults' priorities: ""They care very much about the truth, they don't want to make mistakes, and they recruit their attention to get it right,"" Metcalfe and Friedman. The findings may challenge common beliefs about older adults' cognitive abilities, but they also provide a bit of optimism for everyone, regardless of age. ""To be sure, older adults should be heartened by our results--the older adults did splendidly in our study,"" Metcalfe and Friedman note.

More than a set of features, it conveys the emotions, intent, and identity of the whole individual. The same is not true for the body; cues such as posture convey some social information, but the image of a body does not substitute for a face. A brain imaging study at Rockefeller University offers some insight into how faces achieve this special status. The scientists found that certain spots dedicated to processing faces in the primate brain prefer faces with bodies evidence they are combining both facial and body information to represent an individual. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was conducted in rhesus macaque monkeys. Humans have a similar system that responds to faces, suggesting the findings have relevance for understanding our own social processing as well. ""The body, arguably, is the most important contextual clue a viewer has to help make sense of a face,"" says senior author Winrich Freiwald, an assistant professor and head of the Laboratory of Neural Systems. ""Work by Clark Fisher, a graduate student in my lab, is remarkable in that it shows how the face-processing network places information about a face into its natural context as part of the body, and so begins to generate a sense of agency associated with the whole individual."" In work published in 2008, Freiwald and his colleague Doris Tsao showed that a network of patches along a deep groove in the sides of the macaque brain act as a specialized system for processing faces. A similar system has been found in the human brain, although it is not yet clear how the respective networks align. Both macaque and human brains also have separate patches that respond to bodies. The conventional anatomical wisdom is that both species' brains process faces and bodies independently. However, some studies of human perception suggest a more complex situation. For instance, one study found people's perception of the emotion shown by a face can be altered by body posture, even when the viewers were told to disregard the body. In the study, Fisher began by showing macaques still images that either displayed the face of a fellow macaque alone, the body without a face, or the entire animal. Using high-resolution brain activity scans, captured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, he recorded how each of the six macaque facial patches, located in a part of the brain called the superior temporal sulcus (STS), responded. This approach was intended to reveal if a patch reacted strictly to faces or to some degree to bodies as well or if a patch preferred a face and body together more than the sum of both presented separately. ""The only known way to get what we call a superadditive response, which exceeds those prompted by an individual face and body combined, is if there is some kind of interaction between the facial and body information in the patch,"" Fisher says. This interaction is important because it suggests the brain is no longer just receiving information from the eyes, but beginning to make sense of it. Two of the four face patches, one in particular, showed evidence of a superadditive response. When Fisher replaced the macaque bodies with images of other objects--a metronome, a spray bottle, a power tool superadditivity disappeared from these patches. This result suggested the two patches were responding specifically to bodies, not just any object. He also performed the same experiments while looking at two neighboring body patches, but these patches appeared largely uninterested in faces. This finding appears to match the asymmetry found in human social perception--the fact that bodies influence our perception of faces, while faces do not really add to our reading of bodies. Aside from body context, another crucial clue to the state of mind and intent of another individual comes from the motion of his or her face. Previously, Fisher and Freiwald found face patches respond to facial motion. As it turns out, face patches' preference for bodies and for facial motion intersect at one particular patch. Located within a region at the front of the STS, this patch responds strongly to both. ""We now think this particular face patch might be a critical node in social cognition, the process by which the brain infers a sense of agency for another individual and so determines how to interact appropriately,"" Freiwald says.

Published in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers at the University of Adelaide have identified a key protein involved in a 'super-inflammatory' immune response that drives the progression of MS and other autoimmune diseases. The protein is a specific chemokine receptor involved in moving the body's immune response cells, the T-cells, around the body when they are in the super-inflammatory mode needed to fight persistent infections or conversely, as in the case of autoimmune diseases like MS, attacking the body's own tissues. This chemokine receptor, called CCR2, is a different receptor than was widely assumed to be involved. ""Everybody has been focusing on the CCR6 receptor as the one to target to control this inflammatory response,"" says project leader Professor Shaun McColl, Director of the Centre for Molecular Pathology at the University of Adelaide. ""We've now shown that the receptor to target is actually CCR2. Blocking CCR6 makes the disease worse. If we can find an antagonist to block the CCR2 receptor specifically on these T-cells, we should be able to control the progression of MS."" MS's incurable neurodegeneration currently affects 23,000 people in Australia and is the most common disease of the central nervous system in young adults. ""We still can't control MS well, there's a great need for new therapies,"" says Professor McColl. The University of Adelaide research was conducted by PhD student Ervin Kara under the supervision of Professor McColl and research fellow Dr Iain Comerford, also in the University's School of Biological Sciences. Another potential benefit of the research is in making improved vaccines to fight infection. ""Unlike in autoimmune diseases, where the body's immune response is destroying its own cells and the aim is to block T-cell migration, with persistent infection we want to turn on the super-inflammatory response and enhance the migration of the immune cells to sites where they are needed,"" says Professor McColl. ""This research may help guide development of vaccines that can better force that immune response."" The University of Adelaide McColl SR et al.

With SCIEX s SWATH  Acquisition technologies, the Centre will be one of the biggest clinical proteomics facilities in the world. It will focus on industrializing proteomics research, and spearhead a series of biomarker development projects and international collaborations. The Centre, which is supported initially by  18 million ($27 million) in funding, will also provide valuable research and analytical resources for the new SCIEX Multi-omics Centre for Precision Medicine, a partnership between SCIEX and the Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre at The University of Manchester. The new center, expected to open in mid-2016, will include SCIEX scientists working in partnership with University researchers to develop and trial new omics workflows in a real-world setting. Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are estimated to be the fourth leading cause of death in the US - ahead of pulmonary disease, diabetes, AIDS, pneumonia, accidents and automobile deaths. Precision Medicine is focused on getting the right drug to the right patient in the right dose, but understanding this interplay requires the high-throughput analysis of large sample sets in order to identify and then validate suitable biomarkers of drug response. Industrial-scale SWATH next-generation proteomics rapidly delivers the comprehensive data that are so urgently needed. Traditional proteomics workflows have so far not been able to get biologically or clinically meaningful proteomics results across very large sample cohorts. However, SCIEX s patented SWATH next-generation proteomics technology, which was developed in collaboration with Dr. Ruedi Aebersold at ETH Zurich, enables the quantification of thousands of proteins across large sample sets with a level of data completeness, quantitative accuracy, and reproducibility that was only previously achievable with  gold-standard  targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) methods.  SWATH is a disruptive technology that will allow us to be far more effective at biomarker discovery,  said Professor Tony Whetton, Director, Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre, The University of Manchester. The University of Manchester s new research center will rely on SCIEX s TripleTOF  6600 Systems with SWATH Acquisition for highly reproducible and large-scale biomarker discovery and validation. The University of Manchester has also invested in a number of SCIEX QTRAP  6500 Systems that will allow its researchers to quickly convert the novel biomarker discoveries into routine MRM-based targeted proteomics assays, rather than spending many months generating antibody-based immunoassays, which have recently been linked in the media to the reproducibility crisis in scientific research.  The SCIEX TripleTOF instruments are the best suited systems for SWATH Acquisition,  explained Prof Whetton.  We also chose the SCIEX QTRAP instruments for targeted protein quantification, which will allow highly powerful verification and validation of the biomarkers that we will discover through our SWATH next-gen proteomics pipeline.   We aim to become the leading city for precision medicine. This partnership with SCIEX will enable us to be at the cutting edge of both mass spectrometry and biomarker discovery, and help us to take forward our complete precision medicine portfolio,  he added. To support the industrialization of proteomics, The University of Manchester is also investing in a number of liquid chromatography and automated sample preparation components for the Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre, from SCIEX and other Danaher life science companies.  The promise of large-scale quantitative proteomics can only be delivered through next-generation technologies that provide truly comprehensive data with the speed, sensitivity, quality and reliability that researchers in other fields, such as genomics, now take for granted,  said Jean-Paul Mangeolle, President of SCIEX.  The cutting-edge technology plays a big part in advancing life science research. Our on-going commitment to developing synergies and partnerships such as with The University of Manchester will enable us to accelerate our next-generation technologies and bring them to a much wider audience.

DRAGEN will be used to accelerate TGAC s next-generation sequencing workflows. Initial evaluations of DRAGEN showed that mapping against the ash tree genome was 177 times faster per processing core than TGAC s local HPC systems, requiring only 7 minutes instead of 3 hours on one of the larger datasets. Alignment runs on the rice genome that take approximately two hours on TGAC s HPC servers took just three minutes using DRAGEN. Project Lead Dr Tim Stitt, Head of Scientific Computing at TGAC, said:  We are really excited to be Edico Genome s first DRAGEN customer in the U.K., and we hotly anticipate utilizing this ground-breaking technology to advance our mission to promote a sustainable bio-economy and maintain the U.K. s food security.  In particular, we are really interested to see how DRAGEN handles the wheat genome, which is five times bigger than the human genome and much more complex. Wheat is the staple diet for over 35 percent of the world s population, which is predicted to increase to 9 billion people by 2050.  By understanding the genomic building blocks of wheat, and its diversity, we can better inform breeders on how to improve their yields, particularly in areas where wheat is prone to disease and drought. Obviously the sooner we do this the better and DRAGEN can greatly help us in this mission.  Alignment against reference genomes is a fundamental task undertaken daily by TGAC researchers. Thanks to our partnership with Edico Genome, our DRAGEN system will contain both genome and transcriptome highly optimized analysis pipelines.   TGAC is proud to be a leader in bringing new and disruptive technologies into the hands of the bioscience community and our collaboration with Edico Genome continues to illustrate our leadership in this area.  The DRAGEN Bio-IT Processor is integrated on a PCIe card and available in a pre-configured server, enabling seamless integration into bioinformatics workflows. DRAGEN is highly reconfigurable, using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to provide hardware-accelerated implementations of BCL conversion, compression, mapping, alignment, sorting, duplicate marking, haplotype variant calling and joint genotyping. The DRAGEN system therefore, is much faster than traditional approaches that execute algorithmic implementations in software. In a recent study published in Genome Medicine, DRAGEN sped up analysis of a whole genome from 22.5 hours to 41 minutes, while also achieving sensitivity and specificity of 99.5 percent. Similar efficiency gains could make an enormous impact due to the high throughput of genomic data processed at TGAC, where sequence alignment is critical to many sequencing projects.  Our collaboration with TGAC, a powerhouse in genomics that is home to one of the largest computing hardware facilities in Europe, is a great example of the benefits DRAGEN holds for sequencing centres,  said Pieter van Rooyen, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Edico Genome.  We look forward to continuing to work with researchers and clinicians around the world with a need to analyze next-generation sequencing data rapidly and cost effectively without compromising accuracy.

The findings suggest that GDF10 may be a potential therapy for recovery after stroke. The study, published in Nature Neuroscience, was supported by the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health. ""These findings help to elucidate the mechanisms of repair following stroke. Identifying this key protein further advances our knowledge of how the brain heals itself from the devastating effects of stroke, and may help to develop new therapeutic strategies to promote recovery,"" said Francesca Bosetti, PhD, stroke program director at NINDS. Following a stroke, when brain tissue is deprived of oxygen and nutrients, it begins to die. Once this occurs, repair mechanisms, such as axonal sprouting, are activated as the brain attempts to overcome the damage. During axonal sprouting, healthy neurons send out new projections (""sprouts"") that re-establish some of the connections lost or damaged during the stroke and form new ones, resulting in partial recovery. Before this study, it was unknown what triggered axonal sprouting. Previous studies suggested that GDF10 was involved in the early stages of axonal sprouting, but its exact role in the process was unclear. S. Thomas Carmichael, MD, PhD, and his colleagues at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles took a closer look at GDF10 to identify how it may contribute to axonal sprouting. Examining animal models of stroke as well as human autopsy tissue, Dr. Carmichael's team found that GDF10 was activated very early after stroke. Then, using rodent and human neurons in a dish, the researchers tested the effect of GDF10 on the length of axons, the neuronal projections that carry messages between brain cells. They discovered that GDF10 stimulated axonal growth and increased the length of the axons. ""We found that GDF10 caused many different neurons in a dish to grow, including human neurons that were derived from stem cells,"" said Dr. Carmichael. His group also found that GDF10 may be important for functional recovery after stroke. They treated mouse models of stroke with GDF10 and had the animals perform various motor tasks to test recovery. The results suggested that increasing levels of GDF10 were associated with significantly faster recovery after stroke. When the researchers blocked GDF10, the animals did not perform as well on the motor tasks, suggesting the repair mechanisms were impaired--and that the natural levels of GDF10 in the brain represent a signal for recovery. ""We were surprised by how consistently GDF10 caused new connections to form across all of the levels of analysis. We looked at rodent cortical neurons and human neurons in dish as well as in live animals. It's a demanding gauntlet to run, but the effects of GDF10 held up in all of the levels that we tested,"" said Dr. Carmichael. It has been widely believed that mechanisms of brain repair are similar to those that occur during development. Dr. Carmichael's team conducted comprehensive analyses to compare the effects of GDF10 on genes related to stroke repair with genes involved in development and learning and memory, processes that result in connections forming between neurons. Surprisingly, there was little similarity. The findings revealed that GDF10 affected entirely different genes following stroke than those involved in development or learning and memory. ""We found that regeneration is a unique program in the brain that occurs after injury. It is not simply Development 2.0, using the same mechanisms that take place when the nervous system is forming,"" said Dr. Carmichael. More research is necessary to determine whether GDF10 can be a potential treatment for stroke recovery. National Institutes of Health   press release Carmichael ST et al.

While the social networking site Twitter is known for breaking news and celebrity tweets, it may also prove to be a valuable feedback tool for medical professionals looking to improve the patient experience, according to a study published in the Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences. Johnathan Hewis, an investigator from Charles Sturt University in Australia, analyzed 464 tweets related to MRI over the course of one month and found that patients, their friends, and family members were sharing their thoughts and feelings about all aspects of the procedure through the microblogging site. Tweets were categorized into three themes: MRI appointment, scan experience, and diagnosis. Twitter is a giant in the social media space. In 2014, 19% of the entire adult population of the U.S. used Twitter, with almost 90% of those individuals accessing the service from their mobile phones. Because it is so ubiquitous, Twitter can provide crucial new insights to which practitioners would otherwise not be privy. In the study, patients expressed anxiety about many aspects of the process, including a lot of stress over the possibility of bad news. ""The findings of this study indicate that anticipatory anxiety can manifest over an extended time period and that the focus can shift and change along the MRI journey,"" explained Hewis. ""An appreciation of anxiety related to results is an important clinical consideration for MRI facilities and referrers."" The study found that tweets encapsulated patient thoughts about many other parts of the procedure including the cost, the feelings of claustrophobia, having to keep still during the scan, and the sound the MRI machine makes. One particularly memorable tweet about the sound read, ""Ugh, having an MRI is like being inside a pissed off fax machine!"" Not all the tweets were centered around stress. Many friends and family members expressed sentiments of support including prayers and offering messages of strength. Some patients used Twitter to praise their healthcare team or give thanks for good results. Others spoke about the fact they liked having an MRI because it gave them some time to themselves or offered them a chance to nap. Twitter isn't just words, it's also a way to share pictures. ""An unexpected discovery of the examination preparation process was the 'MRI gown selfie,'"" revealed Hewis. ""Fifteen patients tweeted a self-portrait photograph taken inside the changing cubicle while posing in their MRI gown/scrubs. Anecdotally, the 'MRI gown selfie' seemed to transcend age."" During the course of his analysis, Hewis discovered that many patients took issue with the fact that they were not allowed to select the music they listened to during the MRI. ""Music choice,"" said Hewis, ""is a simple intervention that can provide familiarity within a 'terrifying' environment.' The findings of this study reinforce the 'good practice' of enabling patients' choice of music, which may alleviate procedural anxiety."" With such a broad reach, social networks like Twitter offer medical practitioners the opportunity to access previously unavailable information from their patients, which can help them continuously improve the MRI experience. ""MRI patients do tweet about their experiences and these correlate with published findings employing more traditional participant recruitment methods,"" concluded Hewis.

Psychologists found that the same area of the brain activated when laying down a memory is also activated when rehearsing that memory. The findings, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, have implications for any situation in which accurate recall of an event is critical, such as witnessing an accident or crime. The study showed that the brain region known as the posterior cingulate an area whose damage is often seen in those with Alzheimer's plays a crucial role in creating permanent memories. This region not only helps us to recall the episodic details of an event but also integrates the memory into our knowledge and understanding, which makes it resistant to forgetting. The study involved showing participants 26 short videos of clips taken from YouTube of around 40 seconds in length with a narrative element. For example, one called 'nasty neighbors' depicted two men playing practical jokes on each other. For 20 of the videos, the participants were given around 40 seconds after each video to relate either in their heads or out loud details of the video. For the remaining six videos, this rehearsal period was not given. Up to two weeks later, participants were still able to recall many details of the videos they had rehearsed, whereas the non-rehearsed videos were largely forgotten. MRI scans revealed that the same area of the brain the posterior cingulate was most associated with the benefits of rehearsal. Here, the degree to which brain activity matched when watching and rehearsing the videos predicted how well the videos were remembered a whole week later. Lead researcher Dr Chris Bird said: ""We know that recent memories are susceptible to being lost until a period of consolidation has elapsed. In this study we have shown that a brief period of rehearsal has a huge effect on our ability to remember complex, lifelike events over periods of 1-2 weeks. ""We have also linked this rehearsal effect to processing in a particular part of the brain the posterior cingulate."" ""The findings have implications for any situation where accurate recall of an event is critical, such as witnessing an accident or crime. Memory for the event will be significantly improved if the witness rehearses the sequence of events as soon as possible afterwards.""

Their approach combines an injectable clot-busting nanotherapeutic that targets blockages with an intra-arterial device that restores blood flow to obstructed vessels. The Wyss Institute nanotherapeutic is composed of an aggregate of biodegradable nanoparticles coated with a clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which mimics the way blood platelets behave inside our own bodies. When blood vessels narrow, the shear force of blood flow increases at that location to produce a physical cue that causes platelets to stick to the vessel wall. Similarly, the nanotherapeutic reacts to fluid shear force, releasing tPA-coated nanoparticles in these narrowed regions where vessels are partially occluded, binding to the blood clot and dissolving it away. But until now, the mechanically activated nanotherapeutic would not be effective in complete vascular blockages where there is no blood flow, as is the case for most stroke patients. The most effective treatment today for stroke is known as a ""stent-retriever thrombectomy"" procedure, originally described by Wakhloo and his colleague Matthew Gounis, PhD, Associate Professor of Radiology at UMass. The procedure involves placing a small tube through the blockage, passing a closed stent through it, and then opening the stent to physically pull the large blood clot out of the vessel. ""Even with the retriever thrombectomy procedure, not all clots can be removed with a successful outcome,"" said Gounis. ""Clot fragments can be dislodged, which can lead to microclots and tissue damage downstream in the brain circulatory system, and physical dragging of the stent through the vessel can potentially be damaging as well."" Instead, the new advance describes using the stent not to drag out the clot, but to create a narrow channel restoring blood flow through an opening in the center of the vascular blockage. Doing so creates a high level of shear force generated by restored flow, activating the nanotherapeutic to release and target the clot-busting drug along the opened channel in the clot. After the blood clot is fully dissolved, the stent is re-sheathed and harmlessly removed from the vessel. If during the process any clot fragments break off and travel away through the circulatory system, the drug-coated nanoparticles will remain bound to them and continue to dissolve them locally wherever they go. ""What's progressive about this approach is that the temporary opening of a tiny hole in the clot using a stent device that is already commonly used clinically results in a local rise in mechanical forces that activate the nanotherapeutic to deploy the clot-busting drug precisely where it can best do its job,"" said Ingber, who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. In clinically relevant large animal studies, the team has demonstrated that the drug-device combination works very efficiently, showing that it dissolves clots that fully occlude brain blood vessels that are the same size as they would be in humans. ""This has been a great collaboration between experts in the field of treating stroke and experts in mechanobiology and bioengineering,"" said co-first author of the study Netanel Korin, Ph.D., former Wyss Technology Development Fellow and current Assistant Professor in Biomedical Engineering at the Technion, Israel, who first described the nanotherapeutic in a 2012 Science publication with Ingber. ""We hope that one day it will have a positive impact on patients suffering from a range of medical crises resulting from blood clot occlusions.""

Health messaging is one important way to change behavior on a large scale, but while a successful campaign can improve millions of lives, a failed one can be an enormous waste of resources. ""The problem is that people are notoriously bad at guessing which ads will be effective and ineffective at changing their behavior,"" says Emily Falk, Associate Professor of Communication at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. So Falk and her team take a different approach: They look inside people's brains. In a study published online in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, the researchers found that brain activity in just 50 smokers in Michigan was able to predict the outcome of an anti-smoking email campaign sent to 800,000 smokers in New York State. In collaboration with the University of Michigan Center for Health Communications Research and Research Center for Group Dynamics, the researchers recorded 50 smokers' brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as each smoker viewed 40 anti-smoking images, one by one. In particular, Falk's team focused on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an area of the brain that helps us decide what information is relevant and valuable to us. The researchers predicted that the more activity an image stimulated in the brain's mPFC, the more motivating and self-relevant that image would be to make that person stop smoking. Examples of three of the images used as part of the New York State Quitline campaign. Courtesy: University of Pennsylvania Annenberg School for Communication  These same 40 images were then used in an email campaign sent to 800,000 smokers by the New York State Smokers Quitline. The email to each smoker contained one of the images randomly assigned, along with the identical message: ""Quit smoking. Start Living."" It also provided a link where smokers could get free help to quit. Not all images were created equal: Among those who opened the email, click through rates varied from 10% for the least successful images to 26% for the most successful. But interestingly, the negative anti-smoking images which elicited the most powerful brain response in the mPFC of 50 smokers in Michigan were also the most successful at getting the hundreds of thousands of New York smokers to click for help in quitting. (And research has shown that visits to a quit-smoking site correlate with the likelihood that someone actually will quit.) ""By their nature, messages about the risks we take with our health whether it be by smoking, eating poorly, or not exercising cause people to become defensive,"" says Falk. ""If you can get around that defensiveness by helping people see why advice might be relevant or valuable to them, your messaging will have a more powerful effect."" By combining the self-reported survey data what smokers said they found effective with the brain responses from the fMRI, the researchers found that they could more accurately predict which messages would be effective than by knowing either on its own. Using the brain to predict the success or failure of advertising campaigns has long been a holy grail for marketers. Although some have made claims to proprietary methods for doing so, the science behind it has been opaque. This study by Falk and her colleagues is among the first to demonstrate specific brain patterns to predict the success of public health campaigns. ""If you ask people what they plan to do or how they feel about a message, you one set of answers,"" says Falk. ""Often the brain gives a different set of answers, which may help make public health campaigns more successful. My hope is that moving forward, we might be able to use what we learned from this study and from other studies to design messages that are going to help people quit smoking and make them healthier and happier in the long run.""

This is a comprehensive report that provides insights into the growth drivers and key restraints that are likely to shape the growth trajectory of the digital forensics market in the global scenario. It pegs the overall value of the global digital forensics market at US$2.03B in 2014. Rapid advances introduced in forensic technology that enable recovery of complex data from electronic devices, fingerprints from metals, and DNA profiling, together with decreasing costs over a period of time, have made forensic applications more affordable. As a result, digital forensics technology has successfully forayed into major markets across the globe. Furthermore, expansion of sectors such as banking, law enforcement, defense, and information technology has also significantly contributed to the growth of the global digital forensics market, states the report.  Law enforcement agencies are the most active users of digital forensic tools. They seek the help of such advanced equipment to detect crimes and provide proof of investigations in the courts of law. Moreover, due to the advances introduced in the technology recently, digital forensics is also used across the corporate sector, banking, and IT companies to detect possible thefts. Due to the increasing incidence of cybercrime and confidentiality issues around the world, technologies that provide foolproof ways of detecting crimes are in great demand. Hence, it is expected that the demand for digital forensics will remain high over the forthcoming years, as authorities around the world become more conscious about protecting their valuable data.  For the purpose of the study, the report segments the global digital forensics market into network forensics, computer forensics, cloud forensics, database forensics, mobile device forensics, and others. Of these, computer forensics held the largest market share in 2014, accounting for over 30% of the global digital forensics market. In terms of application, the global market for digital forensics is segmented into healthcare, law enforcement, banking, education, financial services and insurance, transportation and logistics, information technology, and defense and aerospace. Among these segments, law enforcement accounted for the major share of demand for digital forensics registered in 2014 to tackle the surging cybercrimes around the world.  Based on geography, the global digital forensics market is segmented into Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, and Rest of the World. North America occupied the largest share in 2014, accounting for over 50% of the global digital forensics market in terms of revenue. Increasing demand for forensics in North America is mainly exhibited from the banking, IT, law enforcement, and defense sectors. Europe emerged as the second largest market, holding 30% of the global digital forensics market. High penetration of the technology in the U.K, France, and Germany has significantly aided the growth of the market in Europe.","Published: October 28, 2015"

The findings, published in the Oct. 20 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), could someday lead to new therapies for autoimmune diseases.  These results suggest that inhibition of the enzyme cGAS may be an effective therapy for autoimmune diseases such as Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which are linked to the same inflammatory pathway,  said senior author Dr. Zhijian  James  Chen, Professor of Molecular Biology and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator at UT Southwestern. In autoimmune diseases, the immune system turns against the body instead of protecting it. AGS is a rare genetic disorder that mainly affects the brain, while SLE can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, brain, and other organs. Neither disease has a cure, only treatments to control symptoms. Dr. Chen said cGAS is likely amenable to inhibition by small-molecule drugs and that the recent determination of the high-resolution structures of cGAS should facilitate development of such inhibitors. The work builds on two back-to-back studies the Chen lab published in Science in late 2012 that identified cGAS as a sensor of innate immunity   the body s first line of defense against invaders. A commentary in the same issue of PNAS refers to the Chen lab s identification of that long-sought sensor of DNA in the cytoplasm, the cell s gel-like interior, as a  groundbreaking discovery.  The Science studies described a novel cell signaling pathway that starts when cGAS detects foreign DNA, such as viral DNA, and sounds the alarm. That alarm sets off an inflammatory cascade that induces antiviral molecules, including a family of secreted proteins called interferons. The same elegant system can trigger autoimmune disease when self-DNA is inappropriately present in the cytoplasm, Dr. Chen explained. The current study in PNAS examined TREX1, a protein that digests DNA in the cell s interior. Loss-of-function mutations in the gene that codes for the TREX1 protein are linked to AGS and SLE in humans. Like humans, mice lacking TREX1 exhibit autoimmunity, inflammation, and elevated levels of interferons, the researchers report. When the researchers genetically inhibited cGAS in those mice, their symptoms disappeared.  Even deletion of just one of the two genes for cGAS largely rescued the mice from the autoimmune disease,  said Dr. Chen, who also is an investigator in the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense and holder of the George L. MacGregor Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Science. The researchers also studied mice genetically engineered to lack a DNA-digesting enzyme called DNase-II. While the resulting inability to degrade lysosomal DNA led to lethal autoimmunity, once again cGAS inhibition rescued the mice, the researchers report.","Published: October 28, 2015"

In his remarks delivered at Wednesday's ceremony, Brian Smith, V.P. - Mass Spectrometry Operations, Waters Division, said, ""Through our partnership with Dr. Guo, and by combining analytical technology with great science, we are helping one another advance TCM and bring it onto a global stage."" Now that the CFDA regulates Traditional Chinese Medicines and related herbal supplements, Dr. Guo's Research Center for Modernization of Tradition Chinese Medicine is tasked with developing standardized quality control test methods for herbal medicines and bringing them into routine use. Currently, many TCM quality standards are mostly based on the presence of a single marker in a sample, but as Dr. Guo points out, this approach is not without its drawbacks, since an unscrupulous manufacturer could simply add that single marker into the formulation to falsify the results and make it look like it is something it really isn't. ""We're now using UPLC to profile the whole chemical composition, and to quantify the multiple active markers, not just a single marker,"" said Dr. Guo. ""By taking a more holistic approach to quality control, including fingerprint profiling, multi-component quantification, testing for pesticides, heavy metals, and microbial contaminations we can identify whether it is the true herb and attest to its quality."" To fulfill its mission, the Center uses a variety of instruments in addition to the Waters  ACQUITY  UPLC  System. They include the Waters ACQUITY QDa  Mass Detector, the ACQUITY UPC2  Convergence Chromatography  system, and a Xevo  G2-XS QTof mass spectrometer. The Center also relies on modern informatics platforms, such as the Waters UNIFI  Scientific Information System to maintain high working efficiency. Waters officially saluted the work of Dr. Guo and the Research Center for TCM Modernization with a ceremony and three-day conference organized in part and sponsored by the Waters Centers of Innovation Program.

This technology could be applied to anticipate behavior in socioeconomic crises, create more human-like robots or develop avatars of artificial intelligence which are almost indistinguishable from those that represent people. The research project, called IBSEN (Bridging the gap: from individual behaviour to the socio-tEchnical Man), is part of a call for ""novel ideas for radically new technologies"" (FET-Open) by the European Union's Horizon 2020 program. The UC3M coordinates the project and scientists in Spain from the Universitat de Val ncia and the Universidad de Zaragoza also participate, as well as other British, Finnish and Dutch researchers. ""We are going to lay the foundations to start a new way of doing social science for the problems that arise in a society that is very technologically connected,"" explains the head of the project, Anxo S nchez, from the UC3M Interdisciplinary Mathematics group. The goal of the project is to understand the behavior of people on an individual level, especially when they are connected by new technologies like mobile telephones or social networks. To this end, this group of scientists is preparing experiments which will present certain problems of cooperation, social problems and economic games simultaneously to thousands of people to try to decipher the hidden patterns behind their decisions. Afterwards, with this information, researchers will be able to create a simulator of human behavior, a technology that will provide a basis for socioeconomic simulations that will radically change many fields, from robotics to economics, with technological and social impacts like the formulation of policies and decisions about pressing social issues. ""The greatest difficulty is to design a new experimental protocol that allows us to ensure that all the participants in the experiment are available at the same time and really interact, because you are not observing them in a laboratory,"" say the researchers, who are used to doing this kind of experiment in laboratories where they work with groups of 50 to 60 people, when in this case there are more than 1,000 participants. The challenge posed by this project, once the experiments are done, is to obtain a repertoire of human conduct that makes it possible to simulate the behavior of a person and apply it to a robot or recreate what large groups of people will do in certain circumstances. ""On an individual level, it could be used to improve the realism of characters in video games and humanize the avatars one interacts with in the help section of web pages,"" said S nchez.

A research group at Lund University in Sweden has now been able to describe one of these mechanisms at the cellular level. The group's results, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, explain a theoretical learning phenomenon which has so far been difficult to understand. The premise is that human or animal subjects can learn to associate a certain tone or light signal with a puff of air to the eye. The air puff makes the subject blink, and eventually they blink as soon as they hear the tone or see the light signal. The strange thing, however, is that if the tone and the light are presented together (and with the air puff), the learning does not improve, but gets worse. ""Two stimuli therefore achieve worse results than just one. It seems contrary to common sense, but we believe that the reason for it is that the brain wants to save energy,"" says Germund Hesslow. His colleague Anders Rasmussen, who performed the present study, has previously shown that when the brain has learnt a particular association sufficiently, certain neurons that act as a brake on the learning mechanism, are activated. ""You could say that the part of the brain that learned the association (the cerebellum) is telling its 'teacher': 'I know this now, please be quiet'. When the brain has learnt two associations, the brake becomes much more powerful. That is why it results in forgetting, usually only temporarily, however,"" explains Germund Hesslow. Maintaining unnecessary association pathways requires energy for the brain. The researchers believe that this is the reason for the brake mechanism even though in this case it happened to be a little too powerful. The Lund researchers were able to describe how the nerve cells learn and forget through studies of animals, but believe that the mechanisms are likely to be the same in the human brain. Therefore, these findings are of fundamental interest for both brain researchers and psychologists. They could also be of practical interest to educators. ""Obviously, it should be important for teachers to know the mechanisms by which the brain erases the things it considers unnecessary. You do not want to accidentally activate these mechanisms,"" says Germund Hesslow. Lund University   press release Hesslow G et al.

We found that when there s more insulin in the brain, there will be more dopamine released, not less,  says study senior investigator and NYU Langone neuroscientist Margaret Rice, PhD. Her team s new findings from laboratory and behavioral studies with rodents are set to appear in the journal Nature Communications. Rice says the experiments she and her colleagues conducted not only reaffirm that insulin helps trigger the reuptake of dopamine when insulin levels rise, but also are the first to show that the net effect is a rise in dopamine levels. The results may also be the first to demonstrate that insulin s role in the dopamine pathway may affect and explain food choices. In one set of experiments, Rice and her colleagues recorded a 20 percent to 55 percent increase in dopamine released in the striatal region of the rodent brain (where dopamine s effects on the brain are felt and which governs the body s response to getting a reward). The rise occurred along the same timeframe as the rise in insulin activity needed to process any food sugars the mice and rats ate. And this occurred despite the reabsorption, or reuptake, of dopamine that in other regions of the brain tells an animal that its appetite is satisfied. Rice and study co-principal investigator Kenneth Carr, PhD, also conducted separate experiments with rats in which they found that animals fed low-calorie diets had a 10-fold greater sensitivity to increasing insulin levels in the brain (meaning that it took only a tenth of a rise in insulin levels as seen in rats on a normal diet to spur dopamine release). By contrast, rats on high-calorie diets lost all striatal-brain insulin responsiveness. In addition, rats offered a choice between a drink reward that was paired with either an insulin antibody injection to block hormone signaling or a mock placebo injection always favored the drink-injection combination that led to intact insulin signaling (and more dopamine).  Our work establishes what we believe is a new role for insulin as part of the brain s reward system and suggests that rodents, and presumably people, may choose to consume high-carb or low-fat meals that release more insulin   all to heighten dopamine release,  says Rice, a professor in the Department of Neurosurgery at NYU Langone and a member of its Neuroscience Institute. Rice says this finding is important because chronically elevated insulin levels and lowered insulin sensitivity in the brain are closely tied to obesity and type II diabetes, both very prevalent in the United States. Rice says the team plans further experiments on how insulin influences the mammalian brain s control over food motivation and reward pathways, and whether changes in insulin sensitivity brought about by obesity can be reversed or even prevented.  If our future experiments prove successful,  says Rice,  it could confirm our hypothesis that when people refer to an insulin-glucose rush, they may really be referring to a dopamine reward rush. And there are healthy ways to get that by making smart food choices.  NYU Langone Medical Center   press release Rice ME et al.

The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows that artificial touch is highly dependent on several features of electrical stimuli, such as the strength and frequency of signals. It describes the specific characteristics of these signals, including how much each feature needs to be adjusted to produce a different sensation. ""This is where the rubber meets the road in building touch-senstive neuroprosthetics,"" said Sliman Bensmaia, PhD, Associate Professor in the Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy at the University of Chicago and senior author of the study. ""Now we understand the nuts and bolts of stimulation, and what tools are at our disposal to create artificial sensations by stimulating the brain."" Bensmaia's research is part of Revolutionizing Prosthetics, a multi-year Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project that seeks to create a modular, artificial upper limb that will restore natural motor control and sensation in amputees. The project has brought together an interdisciplinary team of experts from government agencies, private companies and academic institutions, including the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and the University of Pittsburgh. Bensmaia and his colleagues at UChicago are working specifically on the sensory aspects of these limbs. For this study, monkeys, whose sensory systems closely resemble those of humans, had electrodes implanted into the area of the brain that processes touch information from the hand. The animals were trained to perform two perceptual tasks: one in which they detected the presence of an electrical stimulus, and a second in which they indicated which of two successive stimuli was more intense. During these experiments, Bensmaia and his team manipulated various features of the electrical pulse train, such as its amplitude, frequency and duration, and noted how the interaction of each of these factors affected the animals' ability to detect the signal. Of specific interest were the ""just-noticeable differences"" (JND), or the incremental changes needed to produce a sensation that felt different. For instance, at a certain frequency, the signal may be detectable first at a strength of 20 microamps of electricity. If the signal has to be increased to 50 microamps to notice a difference, the JND in that case is 30 microamps. The sense of touch is really made up of a complex and nuanced set of sensations, from contact and pressure to texture, vibration and movement. By documenting the range, composition and specific increments of signals that create sensations that feel different from each other, Bensmaia and his colleagues have provided the ""notes"" scientists can play to produce the ""music"" of the sense of touch in the brain. ""When you grasp an object, for example, you can hold it with different grades of pressure. To recreate a realistic sense of touch, you need to know how many grades of pressure you can convey through electrical stimulation,"" Bensmaia said. ""Ideally you can have the same dynamic range for artificial touch as you do for natural touch."" The study has important scientific implications beyond neuroprosthetics as well. In natural perception, a principle known as Weber's Law states that the just-noticeable difference between two stimuli is proportional to the size of the stimulus. For example, with a 100-watt light bulb, you might be able to detect a difference in brightness by increasing its power to 110 watts. The JND in that case is 10 watts. According to Weber's Law, if you double the power of the light bulb to 200 watts, the JND would also be doubled to 20 watts. However, Bensmaia's research shows that, with electrical stimulation of the brain, Weber's Law does not apply--the JND remains nearly constant, no matter the size of the stimulus. This means that the brain responds to electrical stimulation in a much more repeatable, consistent way than through natural stimulation. ""It shows that there is something fundamentally different about the way the brain responds to electrical stimulation than it does to natural stimulation,"" Bensmaia said. ""This study gets us to the point where we can actually create real algorithms that work. It gives us the parameters as to what we can achieve with artificial touch, and brings us one step closer to having human-ready algorithms.""

And once these sensors are gone, that s it; the delicate hair cells don t grow back in humans, leading to hearing loss and problems with balance. But scientists hope to find a way to regenerate these cells by examining how they develop in the first place. New research at Rockefeller University, in A. James Hudspeth s Laboratory of Sensory Neuroscience, has identified two genes pivotal to the production of hair cells in young mice, who, just like human babies, lose the ability to generate these sensors shortly after birth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A kidney-shaped organ: Ksenia Gnedeva, a postdoc in A. James Hudspeth s lab, began by examining changes in gene expression within the lining of the utricle, an organ within the inner ear responsible for detecting linear acceleration by the body.

She saw that the activity of two genes dropped dramatically shortly after the mice were born and hair cells ceased to develop in their utricles. These genes code for the proteins Sox4 and Sox11, which play a role in shaping the identity cells assume by regulating the expression of other genes.

When both genes were shut down, she found that the entire inner ear, not just the utricle, developed abnormally. In other experiments, she turned on the genes in older mice whose hair cells were fully matured, and discovered that this gene activation could induce the production of new hair cells within a fully developed utricle. She is now exploring the series of molecular interactions that normally lead to the activation of these proteins and the steps that follow.  Our ultimate goal is to find a target that would allow us to restore hair cells later on in life.

Previous studies have found an association between marijuana use and stroke, but the new study published as a research letter in the November 3 issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology is the first to explore differences in stroke in marijuana users and non-users, an approach that can help researchers begin to identify possible mechanisms for stroke in users. The researchers from The University Hospital of Strasbourg in Strasbourg, France, looked at all patients under age 45 admitted with ischemic stroke from 2005 to 2014, creating a study cohort of 334 patients, including 58 who were marijuana users. Ischemic stroke is caused by a blockage that interrupts or reduces blood flow to the brain as opposed to hemorrhagic stroke, which occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or ruptures. In marijuana users in the study, ischemic stroke was more likely to be caused by intracranial arterial stenosis, a condition where there is narrowing the arteries inside the skull caused by a buildup of plaque. Intracranial arterial stenosis was found in 45 percent of the marijuana users in the study compared to 14 percent of the non-users. Marijuana users in the study were younger, more likely to be male, more likely to smoke tobacco, and more likely to have other lifestyle risk factors than non-users in the study. Cardio embolism, a blood clot formed elsewhere in the body that moves to the brain, was most common cause of ischemic stroke in non-marijuana users in the study. Investigators found 29 percent of strokes in non-users were caused by cardio embolism compared to only 14 percent in the marijuana users.

While these signals may seem distinct and independent, they actually interact and integrate together within the brain's network of sensory neurons. California Institute of Technology (Caltech) researchers have now discovered that intrinsic neural connections--called crossmodal mappings--can be used by assistive devices to help the blind detect their environment without requiring intense concentration or hundreds of hours of training. This new multisensory perspective on such aids (called sensory substitution devices) could make tasks that were previously attention-consuming much easier, allowing nonsighted people to acquire a new sensory functionality similar to vision. The work is described in a paper published in the journal Scientific Reports. ""Many neuroscience textbooks really only devote a few pages to multisensory interaction,"" says Shinsuke Shimojo, the Gertrude Baltimore Professor of Experimental Psychology and principal investigator on the study. ""But 99 percent of our daily life depends on multisensory--also called multimodal--processing."" As an example, he says, if you are talking on the phone with someone you know very well, and they are crying, you will not just hear the sound but will visualize their face in tears. ""This is an example of the way sensory causality is not unidirectional--vision can influence sound, and sound can influence vision."" Shimojo and postdoctoral scholar Noelle Stiles have exploited these crossmodal mappings to stimulate the visual cortex with auditory signals that encode information about the environment. They explain that crossmodal mappings are ubiquitous; everyone already has them. Mappings include the intuitive matching of high pitch to elevated locations in space or the matching of noisy sounds with bright lights. Multimodal processing, like these mappings, may be the key to making sensory substitution devices more automatic. The researchers conducted trials with both sighted and blind people using a sensory substitution device, called a vOICe device, that translates images into sound. A Venn diagram of the vOICe encoding (blue) images to sounds, which are then reinterpreted from sounds (audition) to images (vision) in the human brain (red). Credit: Shimojo Lab/Caltech  The vOICe device is made up of a small computer connected to a camera that is attached to darkened glasses, allowing it to ""see"" what a human eye would. A computer algorithm scans each camera image from left to right, and for every column of pixels, generates an associated sound with a frequency and volume that depends upon the vertical location and brightness of the pixels. A large number of bright pixels at the top of a column would translate into a loud, high-frequency sound, whereas a large number of lower dark pixels would be a quieter, lower-pitched sound. A blind person wearing this camera on a pair of glasses could then associate different sounds with features of their environment. In the trials, sighted people with no training or instruction were asked to match images to sounds; while the blind subjects were asked to feel textures and match them to sound. Tactile textures can be related to visual textures (patterns) like a topographic map--bright regions of an image translate to high tactile height relative to a page, while dark regions are flatter. Both groups showed an intuitive ability to identify textures and images from their associated sounds. Surprisingly, the untrained (also called ""naive"") group's performance was significantly above chance, and not very different from the trained. The intuitively identified textures used in the experiments exploited the crossmodal mappings already within the vOICe encoding algorithm. ""When we reverse the crossmodal mappings in the vOICe auditory-to-visual translation, the naive performance significantly decreased, showing that the mappings are important to the intuitive interpretation of the sound,"" explains Stiles. ""We found that using this device to look at textures--patterns of light and dark--illustrated 'intuitive' neural connections between textures and sounds, implying that there is some preexisting crossmodality,"" says Shimojo. One common example of crossmodality is a condition called synesthesia, in which the activation of one sense leads to a different involuntary sensory experience, such as seeing a certain color when hearing a specific sound. ""Now, we have discovered that crossmodal connections, preexisting in everyone, can be used to make sensory substitution intuitive with no instruction or training."" The researchers do not exactly know yet what each sensory region of the brain is doing when processing these various signals, but they have a rough idea. ""Auditory regions are activated upon hearing sound, as are the visual regions, which we think will process the sound for its spatial qualities and elements. The visual part of the brain, when processing images, maps objects to spatial location, fitting them together like a puzzle piece,"" Stiles says. To learn more about how the crossmodal processing happens in the brain, the group is currently using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to analyze the crossmodal neural network. These preexisting neural connections provide an important starting point for training visually impaired people to use devices that will help them see. A sighted person simply has to open their eyes, and the brain automatically processes images and information for seamless interaction with the environment. Current devices for the blind and visually impaired are not so automatic or intuitive to use, generally requiring a user's full concentration and attention to interpret information about the environment. The Shimojo lab's new finding on the role of multimodal processing and crossmodal mappings starts to address this issue. Beyond its practical implications, Shimojo says, the research raises an important philosophical question: What is seeing? ""It seems like such an obvious question, but it gets complicated,"" says Shimojo. ""Is seeing what happens when you open your eyes? No, because opening your eyes is not enough if the retina [the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the eye] is damaged. Is it when your visual cortex is activated? But our research has shown that the visual cortex can be activated by sound, indicating that we don't really need our eyes to see. It's very profound--we're trying to give blind people a visual experience through other senses.""

It affects more than 1.3 million Americans, is poorly recognized, and diagnosis is often significantly delayed. Patients with LBD simultaneously experience losses in cognitive function, mobility and behavior. The late Robin Williams had this form of dementia as did legendary NHL coach Alger Joseph  Radar  Arbour, which also can cause visual hallucinations and make depression worse. Until now, there has been no way to assess or operationalize many of the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of LBD in clinical practice. A leading neuroscientist at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) has developed the  Lewy Body Composite Risk Score  (LBCRS) to quickly and effectively diagnose LBD and Parkinson s disease dementia (PDD) in about three minutes. The LBCRS is a brief rating scale that can be completed by a clinician to assess clinical signs and symptoms highly associated with the pathology of this disease. With this important tool, a clinician can assess whether the patient has bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, or rest tremor without having to grade each extremity. This simple, one-page survey provides structured yes/no questions for six non-motor features that are present in patients with LBD, but are much less commonly found in other forms of dementia. James E. Galvin, MD, MPH, developed the LBCRS. Credit: Florida Atlantic University  The LBCRS study, recently published in Alzheimer s & Dementia, the journal of the Alzheimer s Association, involved 256 patients who were compared with the clinical dementia rating and gold standard measures of cognition, motor symptoms, function and behavior. The test was administered in a  real-world  clinic setting with patients who were referred from the community rather than in a research sample. The clinic sample had a mixture of gender, education, comorbidities, behavioral, affective, motor symptoms, and diagnoses. The LBCRS was able to discriminate between Alzheimer s disease and LBD with 96.8 percent accuracy, and provided sensitivity of 90 percent and specificity of 87 percent. For the study, caregivers completed evaluations to determine the presence and severity of non-cognitive symptoms observed in the patient and their impact on the caregiver. Each patient was administered a 30-minute test battery at the time of the office visit to assess their cognitive status. The LBCRS was completed after all other rating scales were scored and the diagnosis was presented to the patient and family.  Most patients never receive an evaluation by a neurologist skilled in the diagnosis of Lewy body dementia, and significant delays and misdiagnoses occur in most patients with this disease,  said James E. Galvin, M.D., M.P.H., one of the most prominent neuroscientists in the country who developed the LBCRS, and a professor of clinical biomedical science in FAU s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine and a professor in FAU s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing.  This new tool has the potential to provide a clearer, more accurate picture for those patients who are unable to be seen by specialists, hastening the correct diagnosis and reducing the strain and burden placed on patients and caregivers.  Another important aspect of the LBCRS is its ability to improve the sensitivity of diagnosis, thereby reducing the risk of exposure to patients with LBD to medications that can have potentially serious adverse consequences. The survey also increases the potential opportunity to receive appropriate symptomatic therapies in a timely fashion, and lessens the inappropriate exclusion from and inclusion into clinical trials.  Early detection of Lewy body dementias will be important to enable future interventions at the earliest stages when they are likely to be most effective,  said Galvin.  Our study provides evidence-based methodology that will have applications in clinical practice, participation in clinical trials, prevention studies, community surveys, and biomarkers research.  Galvin is one of the leading international experts on LBD, and has been working to improve clinical detections by combining biomarkers including high density EEG, functional and structural MRI, PET scans and CSF biomarkers to characterize and differentiate LBD from healthy aging and other neurodegenerative diseases. Galvin has led efforts to develop a number of dementia screening tools, including the Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS), AD8, a brief informant interview to translate research findings to community settings. He has done cross-cultural validation of dementia screening methods in comparison with Gold Standard clinical evaluations and biomarker assays. His team also has developed sophisticated statistical models to explore transition points in clinical, cognitive, functional, behavioral and biological markers of disease in healthy aging, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson s disease.

Red meatAfter thoroughly reviewing the accumulated scientific literature, a Working Group of 22 experts from 10 countries convened by the IARC Monographs Programme classified the consumption of red meat as probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A), based on limited evidence that the consumption of red meat causes cancer in humans and strong mechanistic evidence supporting a carcinogenic effect. This association was observed mainly for colorectal cancer, but associations were also seen for pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer. Processed meatProcessed meat was classified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), based on sufficient evidence in humans that the consumption of processed meat causes colorectal cancer. Meat consumption and its effectsThe consumption of meat varies greatly between countries, with from a few percent up to 100% of people eating red meat, depending on the country, and somewhat lower proportions eating processed meat. The experts concluded that each 50 gram portion of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 18%.  For an individual, the risk of developing colorectal cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed,  says Dr Kurt Straif, Head of the IARC Monographs Programme.  In view of the large number of people who consume processed meat, the global impact on cancer incidence is of public health importance.  The IARC Working Group considered more than 800 studies that investigated associations of more than a dozen types of cancer with the consumption of red meat or processed meat in many countries and populations with diverse diets. The most influential evidence came from large prospective cohort studies conducted over the past 20 years. Public health These findings further support current public health recommendations to limit intake of meat,  says Dr Christopher Wild, Director of IARC.  At the same time, red meat has nutritional value. Therefore, these results are important in enabling governments and international regulatory agencies to conduct risk assessments, in order to balance the risks and benefits of eating red meat and processed meat and to provide the best possible dietary recommendations.

A research paper, published in Nature Genetics, concludes that it will be very unlikely that any single drug will be completely effective in treating all individuals with lupus; rather a combination of treatments will be required depending on specific cases. It suggests that in future, genetic tests should play an important part in determining which treatments are best targeted in any one individual. Lupus, or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), is an autoimmune disease widely acknowledged as being globally more common than leukaemia, muscular dystrophy and multiple sclerosis. The condition, which is currently incurable, affects approximately 24,700 people in the UK and is genetic in origin. Lupus has an extremely wide range of symptoms and at its most serious it can be fatal, affecting internal organs such as the brain, kidneys or heart. Professor Tim Vyse, a Principle Investigator for the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Guy s and St Thomas  and King s College London said:  Lupus is a very complex disease with a wide spectrum of symptoms but this study has given us a much better idea about which genetic variations increase the risk of developing lupus and the likely effects of these variations.  The research was funded by Arthritis Research UK in partnership with the George Koukis Foundation and the Wellcome Trust. Arthritis Research UK s director of research and programmes, Dr Stephen Simpson said:  Understanding the genetic basis of lupus is a crucial step towards improving and managing this painful and debilitating condition. This is the largest study into the genetics of the disease to date, and has shed light on new genes and processes which play a key role in its initiation and progression, so that we can provide better, more appropriate treatment in the future. Arthritis Research UK is the biggest funder of research into lupus in the country and we are committed to helping people live a life free from pain.  Professor Vyse added:  Despite the progress that we have made there are still a lot of genetic variants that need to be studied further to bring us close to solving the genetic puzzle of lupus. Next, we need to expand the genetic research to include results from studies in non-Europeans. This is particularly important in lupus because it is more common in non-European populations compared with Europeans.

A Johns Hopkins University-led research team has now figured out a key aspect of why. In the current issue of the journal Neuron, neuroscientist Alfredo Kirkwood settles a mystery of neurology that has stumped scientists for years: Precisely what happens in the brain when we learn, or how Pavlov s dogs managed to associate an action with a delayed reward to create knowledge. For decades scientists had a working theory of how it happened, but Kirkwood s team is now the first to prove it.  If you re trying to train a dog to sit, the initial neural stimuli, the command, is gone almost instantly it lasts as long as the word sit,  said Kirkwood, a professor with the university s Zanvyl Krieger Mind/Brain Institute.  Before the reward comes, the dog s brain has already turned to other things. The mystery was,  How does the brain link an action that s over in a fraction of a second with a reward that doesn t come until much later?    The working theory which Kirkwood s team has validated is that invisible  eligibility traces  effectively tag the synapses activated by the stimuli so that it can be cemented as true learning with the arrival of a reward. In the case of a dog learning to sit, when the dog gets a treat or a reward, neuromodulators like dopamine flood the dog s brain with  good feelings.  Though the brain has long since processed the sit command, eligibility traces respond to the neuromodulators, prompting a lasting synaptic change. The team was able to prove the theory by isolating cells in the visual cortex of a mouse. When they stimulated the axon of one cell with an electrical impulse they sparked a response in another cell. By doing this repeatedly, they mimicked the synaptic response between two cells as they process a stimulus and create an eligibility trace. When the researchers later flooded the cells with neuromodulators, simulating the arrival of a delayed reward, the response between the cells strengthened or weakened, showing the cells had  learned  and were able to do so because of the eligibility trace.  This is the basis of how we learn things through reward,  Kirkwood said,  a fundamental aspect of learning.  In addition to a greater understanding of the mechanics of learning, these findings could enhance teaching methods and lead to treatments for cognitive problems.

However, a further presentation by the Lord-Lieutenant of Hampshire, Nigel Atkinson Esq.   HM the Queen s local representative   took place on Monday (19th) at Porvair s Head Office in Concorde Close, Segensworth, where the company s Managing Director, Tom Liddell, was delighted to receive it. The Lord-Lieutenant presented a Grant of Appointment and specially engraved crystal bowl to Mr Liddell, which will now be proudly displayed by the filtration specialist. In attendance to witness the presentation were the Mayor and Mayoress of Fareham, Councillor Mike Ford and his wife Anne, as well as the MP for Fareham, Suella Fernandes. Porvair representatives were also honoured to attend a special winners  reception at Buckingham Palace in July, held in honour of UK companies who have shown exceptional success in their field. The Queen s Awards for Enterprise provide an opportunity to celebrate and encourage excellence in UK business. Given only to companies or individuals who are outstanding in their field, they recognise achievements across three categories: international trade, sustainable development, and innovation. Each category has a separate judging panel which makes a recommendation to the Prime Minister s Advisory Committee. The committee then makes a final recommendation to Her Majesty The Queen, who decides the winners. Porvair was recognised for its substantial growth in overseas business, achieving increased year-on-year growth in sales of exported products over the past three years. Since 2011, the company has seen its export sales rise by 140 per cent, amounting to 69 per cent of its total sales from its UK operations. The significant increase in export has been due to the company s success in markets such as coal gasification in Asia, Bioscience and Nuclear in the USA and general industrial process filtration in Europe.  The Group s top export markets have been identified as USA, India, South Korea and Germany. Porvair s Managing Director, Tom Liddell said:  It s been a fantastic couple of years for Porvair, and the Queen s Award has undoubtedly been the icing on the cake.  The business has seen a significant appetite for its UK-manufactured products in recent times, and our strong export sales have reflected that, bringing us to the attention of the Queen s Award judges.  To receive ongoing royal recognition of our performance has been exceptionally rewarding   from the initial media announcement, to our attendance at Buckingham Palace, and now this further presentation from Hampshire s Lord-Lieutenant.  Our hard-working staff have also been granted permission to use the prestigious Queen s Award emblem for the next five years, which has been another pleasing aspect of the recognition.  The Award has already served to enhance our reputation at home and overseas, and we believe it will continue to do so, helping to put UK expertise on the map.  Porvair Filtration Group   which has supplied the aerospace, nuclear, energy, process and bioscience industries with performance-driven filtration equipment for over 50 years   manufactures in both the UK and USA and has an extensive network of sales offices and distribution channels throughout the world.

How does being physically fit affect our aging brains? Neuroimaging studies, in which the activity of different parts of the brain can be visualized, have provided some clues. Until now, however, no study has directly linked brain activation with both mental and physical performance. As reported in the latest volume of the journal NeuroImage, an exciting new study led by Dr. Hideaki Soya from the University of Tsukuba in Japan and his colleagues show, for the first time, the direct relationship between brain activity, brain function and physical fitness in a group of older Japanese men. They found that the fitter men performed better mentally than the less fit men, by using parts of their brains in the same way as in their youth. As we age, we use different parts of our brain compared to our younger selves. For example, when young, we mainly use the left side of our prefrontal cortex (PFC) for mental tasks involving short term memory, understanding the meaning of words and the ability to recognize previously encountered events, objects, or people. When older, we tend to use  the equivalent parts of our PFC on the right side of the brain for these tasks. The PFC has roles in executive function, memory, intelligence, language and vision. With tasks involving the temporary storage and manipulation of memory, long term memories and inhibitory control, young adults favor the right side of the PFC, while older adults engage both the right and left PFC. In fact, with aging, we tend to use both sides of the PFC during mental tasks, rather than just one. This phenomenon has been coined HAROLD (hemispheric asymmetry reduction in older adults) and reflects the reorganization of the brain as compensation for reduced brain capacity and efficiency due to age-related structural and physiological decline. In the study, 60 older men (aged 64-75 years) underwent an exercise test to measure their aerobic fitness. The men, whose physical fitness was found to vary widely, then performed a test to measure their selective attention, executive function and reaction time. This well-known color-word matching Stroop test involved showing the men words meaning color, such as blue, green, red, but asking them to name the color of the letters rather than read the word itself. This is harder than it sounds. When the color of the letters does not match the word blue, red, green it takes the brain longer to react. This reaction time is used as a measurement of brain function. Activity in the PFC region of the mens  brains was measured throughout the test using the functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) imaging technique. This technique provides a measure of blood oxygen concentration in surface blood vessels, indicative of activity in the brain s outer layers, using a set of wearable probes in a cap that is placed on the head. Active brain cells require fresh oxygenated blood which dislodges the deoxygenated blood from that region. fNIRS measures the changes in color between oxygenated red blood and blue deoxygenated blood and thus indirectly measures brain activity. The results from these tests were combined and extensively statistically analyzed to explore the associations between aerobic fitness, Stroop reaction time and brain activity during the Stroop test. As predicted for older adults, during the Stroop test both sides of the PFC are active, with no difference between right and left, verifying the HAROLD phenomenon amongst this group of men. Previous studies have shown that young adults favor the left side of the PFC for this task. Analysis of the relationship between brain activity and Stroop reaction time revealed that those men that favored the left side of the PFC while performing the Stroop test had faster reaction times. This indicates that older adults who use the more youth-like, task-related side of the brain perform better in this test. Next, the association between aerobic fitness and Stroop reaction time was analyzed. Fitter men had shorter reaction times. Based on these findings, the researchers correctly predicted that higher aerobic fitness would be associated with higher left-PFC activity. In other words, fitter men tend to use the more youth-like side of their brains, at least while performing the Stroop test. Previous studies have not examined the interaction between the three factors under investigation in this study - aerobic fitness, mental performance and brain activation. Using clever statistical tests called mediation analyses to look at these interactions, the researchers found that aerobically fitter older men can perform better mentally than less fit older men by using the more important brain regions when needed. In fact, the fitter older men are using parts of their brains in the same way as when they were younger. How do they do this? Professor Soya says  one possible explanation suggested by the research is that the volume and integrity of the white matter in the part of brain that links the two sides  declines with age. There is some evidence to support the theory that fitter adults are able to better maintain this white matter than less fit adults, but further study is needed to confirm this theory.  If you are an aging woman, you will be wondering if these results can be applied to your female brain. Both aging sexes might also wonder whether increasing aerobic fitness later in life can increase mental fitness. The results aren t in, but  head off for a brisk walk just in case.

The companies will now also evaluate the immunotherapy combination of Peregrine's phosphatidylserine (PS)-targeted immune-activator, bavituximab, and AstraZeneca's anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab (MEDI4736), in a global Phase II study in patients with previously treated squamous or non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The randomized Phase II trial will be conducted by Peregrine. As part of the Phase II bavituximab and durvalumab combination trial, patients will be evaluated retrospectively for the correlation between their PD-L1 levels and clinical outcomes. This new study builds on the non-exclusive collaboration initiated between the companies in August 2015 to conduct a Phase I/Ib basket clinical trial evaluating the combination of bavituximab and durvalumab with chemotherapy in multiple solid tumors. Bavituximab and durvalumab are investigational immunotherapies with different mechanisms that assist the body's immune system in fighting cancer. Bavituximab targets and modulates the activity of phosphatidylserine, a highly immune-suppressive molecule expressed broadly on the surface of cells in the tumor microenvironment. In pre-clinical and translational clinical studies, the treatment increases activated T-cells in tumors and fights cancer by reversing the immunosuppressive environment that many tumors establish in order to proliferate. Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Signals from PD-L1 help tumors avoid detection by the immune system. Preclinical data have demonstrated that combining the enhanced T-cell mediated anti-tumor activity of bavituximab with checkpoint inhibitors, like PD-L1 antibodies, prolong the ability of tumor-specific T-cells to continue attacking the tumor. ""In the short period of time that we have been working with AstraZeneca, we have been very impressed with the company's commitment to innovative translational efforts that will help us better understand the dynamics of tumor immunity and clinical response to durvalumab and bavituximab combination in a range of cancers,"" said Joseph Shan, MPH, vice president, clinical and regulatory affairs of Peregrine. ""We expect this extension of our collaboration with AstraZeneca will allow us to run a much more cost-effective and time-efficient trial than would have been possible under our previously planned study using Opdivo as the combination drug in the same lung cancer population. This Phase II study offers several key advantages including a supply of durvalumab that will enable us to conduct a global trial that can enroll patients more rapidly. In addition, the expanded collaboration provides for a more cohesive clinical program utilizing the same PD-L1 and other biomarker analysis across both the new Phase II trial and the already planned Phase I/Ib study combining durvalumab and bavituximab in multiple indications.""","Published: October 24, 2015"

To launch the center of excellence, SCHOTT hosted the pharma industry for an all-day symposium on packaging trends and current production considerations, as well as a tour of its manufacturing site. Partners in attendance included Bausch + Str bel, GEA Lyophil, ARaymond Life, and West Pharmaceutical Services. The keynote address was delivered by a large US pharma company engaged in biotech drugs, emphasizing the need for closer partnerships between the pharma industry and its suppliers in order to uphold patient safety, reduce particle contamination in packaging, and secure the supply chain. Experts at the SCHOTT event reported that specialty drugs are driving medical growth in developing countries, and the self-administered drug market is expected to double in the next five years. Further, particle-related drug recalls have increased more than 300 percent since 2012. As a result, the pharmaceutical industry must guarantee the safety of packaging. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are relying more on RTU packaging as it promotes particle-free drug filling, and allows for filling different container formats on the same filling line, making even the processing of smaller batch sizes cost-effective. SCHOTT s Lebanon manufacturing plant will become a hub where experts from SCHOTT and its partners can develop solutions to exploit the full potential of sterile packaging concepts. Plus, the plant s manufacturing capacity ensures the security of supply of RTU vials and other pharma packaging. Production of adaptiQ  RTU vials has begunSCHOTT, which manufactures approximately 10 billion packaging products each year, demonstrated its manufacturing capability and commitment to RTU solutions by highlighting its adaptiQ  system for RTU vials. adaptiQ  vials come sterile in a nest and tub configuration. The nest securely holds up to 100 sterile vials, which can be loaded onto production lines without the manufacturer having to perform pre-treatment steps such as washing, drying, or sterilization. The system also reduces scratches from vial-to-vial and vial-to-machine contact during the entire process, including lyophilization. Finally, adaptiQ  has been designed in line with industry standards so vials can be filled on production lines normally used for syringes, with only short change-over times.

This agreement replaces the companies  existing clinical collaboration agreement to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of combining Opdivo (nivolumab), Bristol-Myers Squibb s programmed-death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, with FPA008 in six tumor types.  By blocking a key mediator of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, CSF1R inhibition with FPA008 represents a potentially important complementary immuno-oncology mechanism of action to the T-cell directed antibodies and co-stimulatory molecules in our pipeline,  said Francis Cuss, MB BChir, FRCP, executive vice president and chief scientific officer of Bristol-Myers Squibb.  This agreement, which builds upon our existing relationship with Five Prime in immuno-oncology, is another important example of our commitment to expanding our presence in this space and to researching novel combination regimens.   We believe this transformational collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb for our CSF1R antibody program represents the best of both worlds in terms of maximizing the potential of FPA008,  said Lewis T.  Rusty  Williams, M.D., Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Five Prime Therapeutics.  Bristol-Myers Squibb has undisputed leadership in the immuno-oncology landscape, deep clinical development and regulatory expertise, and an established commercial infrastructure to deliver important new therapies to patients. Bristol-Myers Squibb also has a rich pipeline of clinical candidates and approved products, a number of which may have therapeutic synergy when coupled with FPA008, given the potential of CSF1R inhibition to suppress the activity and survival of tumor associated macrophages.

The study s authors used HIV and cancer registry data from 1996 2010 to estimate the number of cancer cases attributable to infections. Of the estimated 6200 cancer cases that occurred in 2008 among HIV-positive people in the USA, 2500 were caused by infections.  About 40% of cancers in HIV-positive people were caused by infections, compared with only 4% in the general population. This proportion is higher than in the general population of any world region, including sub-Saharan Africa, where 33% of cancers are attributable to infection,  says IARC researcher Dr Martyn Plummer, who led the study.  The comparison between populations is striking. Although infection-related cancers are well controlled in the general population, they are clearly a growing concern among HIV-positive people.  The study also shows that HIV-positive people are affected by specific types of infection-associated cancers. In the general population in the USA, the main cancers of infectious origin are stomach, liver, and cervical cancers. In HIV-positive people, the main infection-associated cancers are Kaposi sarcoma due to Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), lymphoma due to Epstein Barr virus (EBV), and anal cancer due to human papillomavirus (HPV). Among HIV-positive women, HPV is responsible for half of all infection-attributable cancers. Kaposi sarcoma, which is associated with strong immune suppression, accounted for nearly a third of infection-attributable cancers in HIV-positive people.  The high incidence of Kaposi sarcoma, despite the availability of combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) since the mid-1990s, suggests that many cases are occurring among people who are unaware of their HIV status or not on appropriate HIV treatment,  says IARC researcher Dr Catherine de Martel, the first author of the study.  As the life expectancy of HIV-positive people increases, cancer is becoming an increasingly relevant health concern,  says IARC Director Dr Christopher Wild.  Early detection and treatment of HIV infection are critical to prevent infection-related cancers while awareness of cancer risks among HIV-positive people will help ensure timely access to diagnosis and treatment.

An international consortium of 39 partner organizations will be funded by the European Commission to work on the integration of new concepts for regulatory chemical safety assessment. These new concepts involve cutting-edge human-relevant in vitro non-animal methods and in silico computational technologies to translate molecular mechanistic understanding of toxicity into safety testing strategies. The ultimate goal is to deliver reliable, animal-free hazard and risk assessment of chemicals. Coordinated by Bob van de Water, Professor of Toxicology at the University Leiden (The Netherlands), EU-ToxRisk has the ambition to become the flagship in Europe for animal-free chemical safety assessment. The project will integrate advancements in cell biology, omics technologies, systems biology and computational modelling to define the complex chains of events that link chemical exposure to toxic outcome. The consortium will provide proof of concept for a new mechanism-based chemical safety testing strategy with a focus on repeated-dose systemic toxicity as well as developmental and reproductive toxicity. Importantly, novel mechanism-based test methods will be integrated in fit-for-purpose testing batteries that are in line with the regulatory framework and will meet industrial implementation. EU-ToxRisk will develop new ab initio quantitative risk assessment approaches based on understanding of so-called  Adverse Outcome Pathways  incorporating all mechanistic toxicity data available in the public domain. It will also achieve a rapid improvement of so-called  read across  approaches as the most important data-gap filling and hence animal-saving alternative method at present. Thus, the project strives towards faster safety evaluation of the many chemicals used by industry and the society. InSphero CSO and co-founder Dr. Jens Kelm says the award,  serves as a key indicator of the value being placed on advanced 3D models in the project, as they provide greater longevity to enable repeat-dose testing in vitro, and improved biological relevance and mechanistic accuracy relative to traditional 2D cell culture models. Much of the in silico and predictive modelling algorithms are based upon large amounts of data accumulated using 2D models, so 3D microtissues stand to be a valuable resource in helping to update and refine that data to increase its predictive value. We are excited to lend our expertise in developing and producing a diverse range of organotypic microtissues, implementing state-of-the-art 3D optimized assays, and integrating microtissues into Body-on-a-Chip systems to advance the aims of the consortium.

Research has shown that in MS, T cells inappropriately attack myelin, the protective layer of fat covering nerves in the central nervous system, exposing them to damage. Emerging studies have also discovered that B cells, another type of white blood cell that had previously been overlooked in MS, are significant contributors to the disease. Recent clinical trials revealed that B cell depletion Therapy (BCDT) in people with relapsing-remitting MS led to dramatic decreases in new disease activity. But how B cells contribute to the disease and the molecular mechanisms involved in the benefit of BCDT has not been fully elucidated. The study by Dr. Amit Bar-Or at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital and colleagues and published in the October issue of Science Translational Medicine, provides groundbreaking insight into the role of B cells and their complex interaction with other immune cells in the context of MS. ""We've recently discovered that different types of human B cells exist. Some B cells have been shown to promote inflammation, while others are actually able to limit inflammation. Our study has implicated a subset of B cells, the GM-CSF producing B cells, as a key contributor in the pro-inflammatory immune cells responses at play in MS,"" explained Dr. Amit Bar-Or, Director of the Experimental Therapeutics Program and Scientific Director of the Clinical Research Unit, at the Montreal Neurological Institute and senior author of the study. The study first examined samples of MS patients comparing them to healthy subjects. Researchers discovered that GM-CSF producing B cells were more frequent and more prone to activation in MS patients. This subset of B cells was able to activate pro-inflammatory responses of myeloid cells of the immune system Confirming these results in patients, the researchers found that after B cell depletion Therapy (BCDT), the myeloid cells became much less pro-inflammatory, suggesting that BCDT may work in part by decreasing the number of GM-CSF-producing B cells and in turn limiting both myeloid cell and T cell contribution to new disease activity. ""The study is significant in discovering a new way by which B cells can contribute to abnormal immune responses in MS which reinforces the rationale for the use of B cell depletion therapy. Furthermore, better identifying the particular subset of B cells responsible for new disease activity, we can look forward to more selectively targeting the ""bad"" B cells while leaving ""good"" B cells intact. This is important because B cells normally play key roles in our immune system, so more selective therapies offer the prospect of decreasing the risk of impairing the patients' immune system in the long run.""

Chronic pain pain which lasts for more than six months is a real problem for many people with approximately 46% of the UK population estimated to suffer from it (comprising 20% of consultations in general practice).  However, some people seem to cope better than others with pain, and knowing more about how these coping mechanisms work might help to develop new ways of treating this distressing symptom. It has been known for a long time that we have receptors in our brains that respond to natural painkilling opiates such as endorphins, but the researchers in Manchester have now shown that these receptors increase in number to help cope with long-term, severe pain. By applying heat to the skin using a laser stimulator, Dr Christopher Brown and his colleagues showed that the more opiate receptors there are in the brain, the higher the ability to withstand the pain. The study used positron emission tomography (PET) imaging on 17 patients with arthritis and nine healthy controls to show the spread of the opioid receptors. This suggests that the increase in opiate receptors in the brain is an adaptive response to chronic pain, allowing people to deal with it more easily. Dr Brown said:  As far as we are aware, this is the first time that these changes have been associated with increased resilience to pain and shown to be adaptive.   Although the mechanisms of these adaptive changes are unknown, if we can understand how we can enhance them, we may find ways of naturally increasing resilience to pain without the side effects associated with many pain killing drugs.  Professor Anthony Jones is the director of the Manchester Pain Consortium which is focused on improving the understanding and treatment of chronic pain. He said:  This is very exciting because it changes the way we think about chronic pain.   There is generally a rather negative and fatalistic view of chronic pain.  This study shows that although the group as a whole are more physiologically vulnerable, the whole pain system is very flexible and that individuals can adaptively upregulate their resilience to pain.  It may be that some simple interventions can further enhance this natural process, and designing smart molecules or simple non-drug interventions to do a similar thing is potentially attractive.  Val Derbyshire, a patient with arthritis remarked,  as a patient who suffers chronic pain from osteoarthritis, I am extremely interested in this research.  I feel I have developed coping mechanisms to deal with my pain over the years, yet still have to take opioid medication to relieve my symptoms.   The fact that this medication has to be increased from time to time concerns me greatly, due to the addictive nature of these drugs. The notion of enhancing the natural opiates in the brain, such as endorphins, as a response to pain, seems to me to be infinitely preferable to long term medication with opiate drugs.   Anything that can reduce reliance on strong medication must be worth pursuing.  Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at the University, Wael El-Deredy said:  Receptor imaging is challenging and requires the co-ordination of a large team to collect and analyse the images.  We are very lucky to have this technique in Manchester. There are very few places in the world where this study could have been done.  The University of Manchester   press release Jones AKP et al.

Microglia cells in the brain, acting as first and main form of active immune defense of central nervous system, may be a key to causing depression. This theory opens door to development of a new generation of anti-depressant medications. Major depression, which afflicts one in six people at some point in their life, is the leading global cause of disability, surpassing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, cancer and HIV/AIDS combined. In a groundbreaking theoretical review paper published in the journal Trends in Neurosciences, researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem suggest that ""progress in the understanding of the biology of depression has been slow,"" requiring expanding beyond the ""abnormalities in the functioning of neurons."" The contribution of other brain cells often neglected by researchers may be more relevant in causing depression, according to psychobiology Prof. Raz Yirmiya, director of the Hebrew University's Laboratory for PsychoNeuroImmunology, and senior author of paper. Recent research at the Hebrew University's laboratory and elsewhere finds that some forms of depression may result from malfunctioning brain cells, termed ""microglia."" ""However,"" Prof. Yirmiya cautions, ""this does not mean that all sub-types of depression or other psychiatric diseases are originated by abnormalities in these cells."" Prof. Yirmiya's new research could have a profound impact on the future development of anti-depressant medications. Present drugs do not always have the desired effect on patients, so there is an urgent need to discover novel biological mechanisms and drug targets for diagnosing the root cause of depression and for treating depressed patients appropriately. In Trends in Neuroscience, the Hebrew University researchers claim that diseased microglia can cause depression and drugs that restore the normal functioning of these cells can be effective as fast-acting anti-depressants. Microglia, which comprise 10% of all brain cells, are the brain's immune cells. They fight infectious bacteria and viruses in the brain. They also promote repairing and healing processes of damages caused by brain injury and trauma. ""Our views on microglia have dramatically changed over the last decade,"" Yirmiya says. ""We now know that these cells play a role in the formation and fine-tuning of the connections between neurons (synapses) during brain development, as well as in changes of these connections throughout life. These roles are important for normal brain and behavioral functions, including pain, mood and cognitive abilities."" ""Studies in humans, using post-mortem brain tissues or special imaging techniques, as well as studies in animal models of depression, demonstrated that when the structure and function of microglia change, these cells can no longer regulate normal brain and behavior processes and this can lead to depression,"" Yirmiya says. Indeed, changes in microglia occur during many conditions associated with high incidence of depression, including infection, injury, trauma, aging, autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In these conditions, microglia assume an ""activated"" state in which they become big and round, and secrete compounds that orchestrate an inflammatory response in the brain. The shape and function of microglia can be also changed following exposure to chronic unpredictable psychological stress, which is one of the leading causes of depression in humans. Importantly, research in Prof. Yirmiya's laboratory recently discovered that following exposure to such stress, some microglia die and the remaining cells appear small and degenerated. These findings have both theoretical and clinical implications. According to the new theory, either activation or decline of microglia can lead to depression. Therefore, the same class of drugs cannot treat the disease uniformly. Yirmiya asserts that a personalized medical approach should be adopted in which the status of the microglia in the individual patient should be established first. Based on this initial assessment, treatment with drugs that either inhibit the over-active microglia or stimulate the suppressed microglia should be employed.

Specifically, the researchers were able to extract more than 400 proteins from neurons that came from the brain's temporal cortex, far more than have been extracted previously. The study is published in the journal Scientific Reports. ""This new technique allows for more precise examination of formalin-preserved tissue from hundreds of brain banks around the world, and holds particular value in studying the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenertative diseases,"" particularly for examining, says the study's senior investigator, Thomas Wisniewski, MD, director of the NYU Langone Center for Cognitive Neurology, and the Lulu P. and David J. Levidow Professor of Neurology, and professor of Pathology, and Psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine. ""Previously these types of studies required frozen tissue."" The study used tissue saturated in wax and cut for analysis, referred to as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Pathology laboratories in hospitals routinely collect this kind of tissue, and it is available inexpensively and abundantly. The researchers used a technique known as laser-capture microdissection to count hundreds of proteins in a specific group of neurons isolated from the tissue in areas as small as single cells. The protein content was left undisturbed. Until now, the FFPE technique made it hard to study proteins at the cell level. Researchers also worried about degradation of proteins in working with the tissue. However, recognizing that insoluble groups of proteins are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, the team collected additional samples of neurons from cells, using formic acid to make the tissue soluble. ""Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue is plentiful,"" says Dr. Wisniewski.

Tsien. He postulates in his ""Theory of Connectivity"" that, not unlike high school, where a human clique includes your closest friends, a neural clique is typically comprised of a couple of similar neurons. But unlike most transient teenage cliques, neural cliques provide a basic, prewired framework for how neurons connect and function lifelong. ""The brain is not a blank sheet. This complex wiring system that ends up being our brain, starts with these cliques,"" said Tsien, co-director of the Brain & Behavior Discovery Institute at Georgia Regents University (GRU) and Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Cognitive and Systems Neurobiology. ""We think the brain has these combinatorial connections among brain cells, and through these connections, comes the knowledge and flexibility to deal with whatever comes in and goes out."" Tsien, a memory researcher who created the smart mouse Doogie 15 years ago, is among the myriad of neuroscientists who have been dissecting and analyzing human and animal brains for centuries, trying to figure out how they work and what happens when they don't. ""This is the traditional approach, to disassemble, much like kids try to figure out a new toy by taking it apart,"" said Tsien. He decided this time to take a cue from theoretical physicists, who approach the vast universe and solar system with a combination of what they know and what they can see and perform a ""thought experiment."" ""If we understand how the brain was designed, it reveals a lot about how the brain works,"" Tsien said. That knowledge should enable better development and testing of therapeutics and provide a better blueprint for how different maladies impact brain function, he said. The right equation also becomes a sort of yardstick for measuring the brain's capacity and maybe even designing better artificial intelligence. His result is an organizing principle for the brain and cliques are only a beginning. Tsien's ""Theory of Connectivity"" and resulting equation - published in the journal Trends in Neurosciences - also says that neural cliques congregate to form functional connectivity motifs, or FCMs. The more complex the issue at hand, the more cliques join the FCM. Tsien uses some fundamental quests as an example. ""Let's say, a simple organism needs to deal with only two possibilities - like whether to find food or a mate. The FCM to deal with this dilemma would require, at a minimum, three cliques. One clique represents food, another a mate, and a third enables you to look at both as good things that I need,"" Tsien said. Complicating the situation by whether what the creature really should focus on is avoiding predators or poison along the way, requires more neural cliques and a bigger FCM. ""Whether it's three cells or a billion cells, we think, at the fundamental level, this is the building block,"" Tsien said. ""This equation gives you a way to wire the brain cells in such a way to turn seemingly infinite possibilities into organized knowledge."" His equation, n=2i-1, defines how many cliques are needed for an FCM. N is the number of neural cliques connected in different possible ways; 2 means the clique is on or off; i is the information you are dealing with; and -1 is just part of the math that enables you to account for all possibilities, Tsien said. The brain's bottom line mission in Tsien's view is to use its relatively limited neurons to maximize the capacity to cope with essentially infinite possibilities. And, there is ample evidence that normal neural networking is orderly. In fact, order appears a necessity in a human brain with 100 billion neurons and where each principal neuron can have 30,000 connections. Without order, people can have developmental delays and disabilities, conditions such as schizophrenia, even die. Still the prevalent view is that the start is random and learning brings some kind of order to the connecting, Tsien said. The fact that all goes amazingly well for most of us, begs the question: How is the brain's groundwork laid to enable organization and connectivity on such a massive scale? ""Everyone in the field agrees that the magic should be in how the brain cells are connected,"" said Dr. Phillip Wang, MCG neuroscientist and Tsien's colleague. The number of connections expand and evolve constantly not only through evolution, but also as we meet new people and learn new information. Computers use the efficient binary coding scheme i=2n, where n equals the number of transistors and i is information. While some aficionados might disagree, Tsien said computers operate very differently than brains and can't actually discover knowledge, only find, organize and take in what's already out there. ""The brain needs to be able to see dynamic relationships and discover common patterns, not just differences between pictures of a Chihuahua and a German shepherd. Intelligence must lie in the brain's wiring logic that turns random possibilities into some kind of organized pattern and generalized knowledge."" He notes that the Hebbian theory, detailed in the 1949 book, ""The Organization of Behavior"" by the late Canadian psychologist Dr. Donald O. Hebb, basically says the neuron sending the original message fires first and repeatedly to properly stimulate the next neuron. Consequently, the connections between them, called synapses, strengthen. The theory is considered a fundamental of how we learn, Tsien said. But how cells organize and connect to make that possible has remained elusive. Tsien's said his power-of-two-based mathematical explanation now needs vigorous testing. GRHealth - Georgia Regents Medical Center Tsien JZ A Postulate on the Brain's Basic Wiring Logic.

These findings suggest a way to cost-effectively manufacture red blood cells from stem cells; the patients who could potentially benefit include those who cannot use blood currently available in blood banks. Previous research has shown that it is possible to use various methods to force different kinds of stem cells to produce transfusion-grade red blood cells in a laboratory, but, at a cost between $8,000 and $15,000 per unit of blood, the processes are expensive. This is the first study to combine stem cells, powerful gene editing tools, and data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The research team behind the Cell Stem Cell study--led by senior author and Dana-Farber/Boston Children's pediatric hematologist Vijay Sankaran, MD, PhD--homed in on their target gene, called SH2B3, after GWAS data revealed naturally occurring variations in the gene's sequence that reduce its activity result in increased red blood cell production. ""There's a variation in SH2B3 found in about 40 percent of people that leads to modestly higher red blood cell counts,"" Sankaran said. ""But if you look at people with really high red blood cell levels, they often have rare SH2B3 mutations. That said to us that here is a target where you can partially or completely eliminate its function as a way of increasing red blood cells robustly. ""There are many patients with rare blood types or blood disorders who need very specific kinds of blood and cannot accept most donated blood,"" Sankaran continued. ""Also, there are patients for whom there is a possibility of using red blood cells as a way of delivering therapies."" Sankaran and his collaborators--including study co-first authors Felix Giani, Claudia Fiorini, PhD, and Aoi Wakabayashi of Dana-Farber/Boston Children's--wanted to see if were possible to use SH2B3 as a target to genetically increase the yield of laboratory-based red blood cell production processes (as opposed to tweaking cells in culture by adding cytokines and other factors). To do, so, they first used RNA interference (RNAi, which silences gene expression) to turn down SH2B3 in donated adult, human, blood-forming stem cells (hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, or HSPCs) and HSPCs from human umbilical cord blood. The team's data confirmed that shutting off SH2B3 with RNAi skews an HSPC's profile of cell production to favor red blood cells. Adult and cord blood stem cells treated with RNAi produced three-to-five and five-to-seven times more red blood cells than controls, respectively. Using multiple tests, the team found that the red blood cells produced by RNAi were essentially indistinguishable from control cells. Sankaran and his team recognized that their HSPC/RNAi approach would be very difficult to scale up to a level that could impact the clinical need for red blood cells. Thus, in a separate set of experiments, they used CRISPR gene editing to permanently shut off SH2B3 in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines, which can be readily renewed in a laboratory. They then treated the edited cells with a cocktail of factors known to encourage blood cell production. Under these conditions, the edited hESCs produced three times more red blood cells than controls. Again, the team could find no significant differences between red blood cells from the edited stem cells and controls. Sankaran thinks that SH2B3's enforces some kind of upper limit on how much red blood cell precursors respond to calls for more red blood cell production. ""This is a nice approach because it removes the brakes that normally keep cells restrained and limit how much red blood cell precursors respond to different laboratory conditions,"" Sankaran explained. He notes that in his vision, stem cells edited to keep SH2B3 turned off would be maintained in culture as a kind of cellular starter and used to produce red blood cells for treatment purposes; the edited stem cells themselves would never be used for direct treatment. He also believes that with further development, the combination of CRISPR and hESCs could increase the yields and reduce the costs of producing red blood cell in the laboratory to the level where commercial-scale manufacture could be feasible. ""This is allowing us to get close to the cost of normal donor-derived blood units,"" he said. """"If we can get the costs down to about $2,000 per unit, that's a reasonable cost.""","Published: October 23, 2015"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/big-data-used-to-identify-new-cancer-driver-genes-188057, Big Data  Used to Identify New Cancer Driver Genes In a collaborative study led by Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute  SBP   researchers have combined two publicly available  omics  databases to create a new catalogue of  cancer drivers    ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Cancer drivers are genes that when altered, are responsible for cancer progression. The researchers used cancer mutation and protein structure databases to identify mutations in patient tumors that alter normal protein-protein interaction (PPI) interfaces. The study identified more than 100 novel cancer driver genes and helps explain how tumors driven by the same gene may lead to different patient outcomes.  This is the first time that three-dimensional protein features, such as PPIs, have been used to identify driver genes across large cancer datasets,  said lead author Eduard Porta-Pardo, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow at SBP.  We found 71 interfaces in proteins previously unrecognized as cancer drivers, representing potential new cancer predictive markers and/or drug targets. Our analysis also identified several driver interfaces in known cancer genes, such as TP53, HRAS, PI3KCA and EGFR, proving that our method can find relevant cancer driver genes and that alterations in protein interfaces are a common pathogenic mechanism of cancer. Cancer is caused by the accumulation of mutations to DNA. Until now, scientists have focused on finding alterations in individual genes and cell pathways that can lead to cancer. But the recent push by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to encourage data sharing has led to an era of unprecedented ability to systematically analyze large scale genomic, clinical, and molecular data to better explain and predict patient outcomes, as well as finding new drug targets to prevent, treat, and potentially cure cancer.  For this study we used an extended version of e-Driver, our proprietary computational method of identifying protein regions that drive cancer. We integrated tumor data from almost 6,000 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with more than 18,000 three-dimensional protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB),  said Adam Godzik, Ph.D., director of the Bioinformatics and Structural Biology Program at SBP.  The algorithm analyzes whether structural alterations of PPI interfaces are enriched in cancer mutations, and can therefore identify candidate driver genes.   Genes are not monolithic black boxes. They have different regions that code for distinct protein domains that are usually responsible for different functions. It s possible that a given protein only acts as a cancer driver when a specific region of the protein is mutated,  Godzik explained.  Our method helps identify novel cancer driver genes and propose molecular hypotheses to explain how tumors apparently driven by the same gene have different behaviors, including patient outcomes.   Interestingly, we identified some potential cancer drivers that are involved in the immune system. With the growing appreciation of the importance of the immune system in cancer progression, the immunity genes we identified in this study provide new insight regarding which interactions may be most affected,  Godzik added.","Published: October 23, 2015"

Many of these tumors develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs that kill cells by damaging their DNA. MIT cancer biologists have now discovered how this happens: A backup system that takes over when p53 is disabled encourages cancer cells to continue dividing even when they have suffered extensive DNA damage. The researchers also discovered that an RNA-binding protein called hnRNPA0 is a key player in this pathway.  I would argue that this particular RNA-binding protein is really what makes tumor cells resistant to being killed by chemotherapy when p53 is not around,  says Michael Yaffe, the David H. Koch Professor in Science, a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and the senior author of the study. The findings suggest that shutting off this backup system could make p53-deficient tumors much more susceptible to chemotherapy. It may also be possible to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from chemotherapy and which will not, by measuring how active this system is in patients  tumors. Rewired for resistance In healthy cells, p53 oversees the cell division process, halting division if necessary to repair damaged DNA. If the damage is too great, p53 induces the cell to undergo programmed cell death. In many cancer cells, if p53 is lost, cells undergo a rewiring process in which a backup system, known as the MK2 pathway, takes over part of p53 s function. The MK2 pathway allows cells to repair DNA damage and continue dividing, but does not force cells to undergo cell suicide if the damage is too great. This allows cancer cells to continue growing unchecked after chemotherapy treatment.  It only rescues the bad parts of p53 s function, but it doesn t rescue the part of p53 s function that you would want, which is killing the tumor cells,  says Yaffe, who first discovered this backup system in 2013. In the new study, the researchers delved further into the pathway and found that the MK2 protein exerts control by activating the hnRNPA0 RNA-binding protein. RNA-binding proteins are proteins that bind to RNA and help control many aspects of gene expression. For example, some RNA-binding proteins bind to messenger RNA (mRNA), which carries genetic information copied from DNA. This binding stabilizes the mRNA and helps it stick around longer so the protein it codes for will be produced in larger quantities.  RNA-binding proteins, as a class, are becoming more appreciated as something that s important for response to cancer therapy. But the mechanistic details of how those function at the molecular level are not known at all, apart from this one,  says Ian Cannell, a research scientist at the Koch Institute and the lead author of the Cancer Cell paper. In this paper, Cannell found that hnRNPA0 takes charge at two different checkpoints in the cell division process. In healthy cells, these checkpoints allow the cell to pause to repair genetic abnormalities that may have been introduced during the copying of chromosomes. One of these checkpoints, known as G2/M, is controlled by a protein called Gadd45, which is normally activated by p53. In lung cancer cells without p53, hnRNPA0 stabilizes mRNA coding for Gadd45. At another checkpoint called G1/S, p53 normally turns on a protein called p21. When p53 is missing, hnRNPA0 stabilizes mRNA for a protein called p27, a backup to p21. Together, Gadd45 and p27 help cancer cells to pause the cell cycle and repair DNA so they can continue dividing. Personalized medicine The researchers also found that measuring the levels of mRNA for Gadd45 and p27 could help predict patients  response to chemotherapy. In a clinical trial of patients with stage 2 lung tumors, they found that patients who responded best had low levels of both of those mRNAs. Those with high levels did not benefit from chemotherapy.  You could measure the RNAs that this pathway controls, in patient samples, and use that as a surrogate for the presence or absence of this pathway,  Yaffe says.  In this trial, it was very good at predicting which patients responded to chemotherapy and which patients didn t.   The most exciting thing about this study is that it not only fills in gaps in our understanding of how p53-deficient lung cancer cells become resistant to chemotherapy, it also identifies actionable events to target and could help us to identify which patients will respond best to cisplatin, which is a very toxic and harsh drug,  says Daniel Durocher, a senior investigator at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute of Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who was not part of the research team. The MK2 pathway could also be a good target for new drugs that could make tumors more susceptible to DNA-damaging chemotherapy drugs. Yaffe s lab is now testing potential drugs in mice, including nanoparticle-based sponges that would soak up all of the RNA binding protein so it could no longer promote cell survival.","Published: October 23, 2015"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/using-ultrasound-to-improve-drug-delivery-213223,Using Ultrasound to Improve Drug Delivery New approach could aid in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Using ultrasound waves, researchers from MIT and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) have found a way to enable ultra-rapid delivery of drugs to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This approach could make it easier to deliver drugs to patients suffering from GI disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn s disease, the researchers say. Currently, such diseases are usually treated with drugs administered as an enema, which must be maintained in the colon for hours while the drug is absorbed. However, this can be difficult for patients who are suffering from diarrhea and incontinence. To overcome that, the researchers sought a way to stimulate more rapid drug absorption. We re not changing how you administer the drug. What we are changing is the amount of time that the formulation needs to be there, because we re accelerating how the drug enters the tissue,  says Giovanni Traverso, a research affiliate at MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, a gastroenterologist at MGH, and one of the senior authors of a paper describing the technique.  With additional research, our technology could prove invaluable in both clinical and research settings, enabling improved therapies and expansion of research techniques applied to the GI tract. It demonstrates for the first time the active administration of drugs, including biologics, through the GI tract,  says Daniel Blankschtein, the Hermann P. Meissner Professor in Chemical Engineering, who is also a senior author of the paper. Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and a member of the Koch Institute, is also a senior author of the paper. The study s lead author is Carl Schoellhammer, a graduate student in chemical engineering. Enhanced delivery Langer began exploring the possibility of using ultrasound to enhance drug delivery 30 years ago. In 1995, he and Blankschtein reported in Science that ultrasound could enable delivery of drugs through the skin, but until now it had not been explored in the GI tract.  We've been working on ultrasound as a means to enhance transport through materials and skin since the mid-1980s, and I think the implications of this new approach have the potential to aid many patients,  Langer says. Ultrasound improves drug delivery by a mechanism known as transient cavitation. When a fluid is exposed to sound waves, the waves induce the formation of tiny bubbles that implode and create microjets that can penetrate and push medication into tissue. In this study, the researchers first tested their new approach in the pig GI tract, where they found that applying ultrasound greatly increased absorption of both insulin, a large protein, and mesalamine, a smaller molecule often used to treat colitis.  Demonstrating delivery of molecules with a wide range of sizes, including active biologics, underscores the potentially broad areas in which this technology could be applied,  says Schoellhammer, who won the $15,000 Lemelson-MIT  Cure it!  Student Prize earlier this year for this research and for a microneedle pill that delivers drugs directly into GI tissue. The team also reached the finals of the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition. Better treatment The researchers next investigated whether ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery could effectively treat disease in animals. In tests of mice, the researchers found that they could resolve colitis symptoms by delivering mesalamine followed by one second of ultrasound every day for two weeks. Giving this treatment every other day also helped, but delivering the drug without ultrasound had no effect. They also showed that ultrasound-enhanced delivery of insulin effectively lowered blood sugar levels in pigs.  The capabilities of the technology are quite well demonstrated. This technology has great utility in localized as well as systemic delivery of drugs,  says Samir Mitragotri, a professor of systems biology and bioengineering at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Mitragotri was also an author of the 1995 Science paper on ultrasound drug delivery but was not involved in the new research. While inflammatory GI diseases are an obvious first target for this type of drug delivery, it could also be used to administer drugs for colon cancer or infections of the GI tract, Traverso says. The researchers are now performing additional animal studies to help them optimize the ultrasound device and prepare it for testing in human patients.","Published: October 23, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/cells-rhythmically-regulate-their-genes-190110,Cells Rhythmically Regulate Their Genes Study led by researchers at Caltech shows that pulsing can allow two proteins to interact with each other in a rhythmic fashion that allows them to control genes  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Even in a calm, unchanging environment, cells are not static. Among other actions, cells activate and then deactivate some types of transcription factors proteins that control the expression of genes in a series of unpredictable and intermittent pulses. Since discovering this pulsing phenomenon, scientists have wondered what functions it could provide for cells. Now, a new study from Caltech researchers shows that pulsing can allow two proteins to interact with each other in a rhythmic fashion that allows them to control genes. Specifically, when the expression of the transcription factors goes in and out of sync, gene expression also goes up and down. These rhythms of activation, the researchers say, may also underlie core processes in the cells of organisms from across the kingdoms of life. ""The way transcription factor pulses sync up with one another in time could play an important role in allowing cells to process information, communicate with other cells, and respond to stress,"" says paper coauthor Michael Elowitz, a professor of biology and biological engineering and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.The research was led by Caltech postdoctoral scholar Yihan Lin. Other Caltech authors of the paper are Assistant Professor of Chemistry Long Cai; Chang Ho Sohn, a staff scientist in the Cai lab; and Elowitz's former graduate student Chiraj K. Dalal (PhD '10), now at UC San Francisco. Cai, Dalal, and Elowitz reported a functional role for transcription factor pulsing in 2008. In the meantime, researchers worldwide have been steadily uncovering similar surges of protein activity across diverse cell types and genetic systems. Realizing that many different factors are pulsing in the same cell even in unchanging conditions, the Caltech scientists began to wonder if cells might adjust the relative timing of these pulses to enable a novel sort of time-based regulation. To find out, they set up time-lapse movies to follow two pulsing proteins and a target gene in real time in individual yeast cells.   The team tagged two central transcription factors named Msn2 and Mig1 with green and red fluorescent proteins, respectively. When the transcription factors are activated, they move into the nucleus, where they influence gene expression. This movement as well as the activation of the factors can be visualized because the fluorescent markers concentrate within the small volume of the nucleus, causing it to glow brightly, either green, red, or both. The color choice for the fluorescent tags was symbolic: Msn2 serves as an activator, and Mig1 as a repressor. ""Msn2, the green factor, steps on the gas and turns up gene expression, while Mig1, the red factor, hits the brakes,"" says Elowitz. When the scientists stressed the yeast cells by adding heat, for example, or restricting food, the pulses of Msn2 and Mig1 changed their timing with respect to one another, with more or less frequent periods of overlap between their pulses, depending upon the stressing stimulus. Generally, when the two transcription factors pulsed in synchrony, the repressor blocked the ability of the activator to turn on genes. ""It's like someone simultaneously pumping the gas and brake pedals in a car over and over again,"" says Elowitz. But when they were off-beat, with the activator pulsing without the repressor, gene expression increased. ""When the cell alternates between the brake and the gas the Msn2 transcription factor in this case the car can move,"" says Elowitz. As a result of these stress-altered rhythms, the cells successfully produced more (or fewer) copies of certain proteins that helped the yeast cope with the unpleasant situation. Previously, researchers have thought that the relative concentrations of multiple transcription factors in the nucleus determine how they regulate a common gene target a phenomenon known as combinatorial regulation. But the new study suggests that the relative timing of the pulses of transcription factors may be just as important as their concentration. ""Most genes in the cell are regulated by several transcription factors in a combinatorial fashion, as parts of a complex network,"" says Cai. ""What we're now seeing is a new mode of regulation that controls the pulse timing of transcription factors, and this could be critical to understanding the combinatorial regulation in genetic networks."" ""There appears to be a layer of time-based regulation in the cell that, because it can only be observed with movies of individual cells, is still largely unexplored,"" says Lin. ""We look forward to learning more about this intriguing and underappreciated form of gene regulation.""     In future research, the scientists will try to understand how prevalent this newfound mode of time-based regulation is in a variety of cell types and will examine its involvement in gene regulation systems. In the context of synthetic biology the harnessing and modification of biological systems for human technological applications the researchers also hope to develop methods to control such pulsing to program new cellular behaviors.","Published: October 23, 2015"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/glowing-fingerprints-to-fight-crime-196348,Glowing Fingerprints to Fight Crime A CSIRO scientist who had his home broken into has developed a new crime scene identification technique to help fingerprint criminals  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. By adding a drop of liquid containing crystals to surfaces, investigators using a UV light are able to see invisible fingerprints  glow  in about 30 seconds. The strong luminescent effect creates greater contrast between the latent print and surface enabling higher resolution images to be taken for easier and more precise analyses. CSIRO materials scientist Dr Kang Liang believes that this technique could be used for more challenging evidence where conventional  dusting  is not appropriate.  While police and forensics experts use a range of different techniques, sometimes in complex cases evidence needs to be sent off to a lab where heat and vacuum treatment is applied,  Dr Liang said. Our method reduces these steps, and because it s done on the spot, a digital device could be used at the scene to capture images of the glowing prints to run through the database in real time.  CSIRO s study shows that tiny crystals rapidly bind to fingerprint residue, including proteins, peptides, fatty acids and salts, creating an ultrathin coating that s an exact replica of the pattern.  Because it works at a molecular level it s very precise and lowers the risk of damaging the print,  Dr Liang said. CSIRO tested the method on nonporous surfaces including window and wine glass, metal blades and plastic light switches, with successful results. Fingerprint identification has been used as a key method by law enforcement and forensic experts for over 100 years. Adding CSIRO s method to the mix could save valuable time, costs and enhance investigations.    When my house was broken into I saw how common practice fingerprinting is for police,  Dr Liang said.  Knowing that dusting has been around for a long time, I was inspired to see how new innovative materials could be applied to create even better results.  As far as we know, it s the first time that these extremely porous metal organic framework (MOF) crystals have been researched for forensics.  MOF crystals have a number of benefits in that they are cheap, react quickly and can emit a bright light. The technique doesn t create any dust or fumes, reducing waste and risk of inhalation. The method could have other valuable applications including new biomedical devices and drug delivery.","Published: October 23, 2015"

That s why the Food and Drug Administration is implementing new rules to make food producers, manufacturers and processors more accountable in preventing an outbreak.  It s really making food industries think about their product holistically and what measures they can take to ensure when the product goes out the door and touches the consumer s plate, it is safe,  said Angela Shaw, an assistant professor of food science and human nutrition at Iowa State. The new rules require companies to identify and address potential risks at all points of the food supply chain. That includes suppliers providing ingredients for the final product as well as the transportation system used to get the product to market. Shaw says the emphasis on risk-based prevention is intended to reduce the number of foodborne illnesses and recalls. The rules also allow for stronger enforcement when there is a problem.    Prior to this rule, FDA could not require a recall to occur, it was all voluntary,  Shaw said.  Now with this rule, they can force a mandatory recall.  The FDA s case against Stewart Parnell, the former CEO of Peanut Corporation of America, is an example of why mandatory recalls are needed. Parnell was recently sentenced to prison for failing to take action in a salmonella outbreak linked to nine deaths and hundreds of illnesses. Shaw says this is an extremely rare case, but it underscores the importance of mandatory recalls so that the FDA does not have to resort to legal action.  Produce is a primary target Iowa State food safety teams are creating training programs, based on the FDA mandate, for producers ranging from food hubs that serve restaurants and grocery stores to companies that make barbecue spices and sauces. Shaw says there are three main preventative controls   fresh produce, food for humans and animal food   that will impact most Iowa producers and processors. Farmer s markets are exempt.   Unprocessed fruits and vegetables, a common source of foodborne illnesses, were previously unregulated by the FDA in the U.S. Catherine Strohbehn, an adjunct professor of hospitality management at Iowa State, works specifically with growers of fresh produce. The majority of those growers have already identified changes for their farms, Strohbehn said. However, much of the produce we consume is imported. The new FDA rules also increase surveillance of fruits, vegetables and other ingredients from foreign producers. Strohbehn says this will limit the risk associated with a global food supply.    A global food supply does provide us with wider variety of choices and enables us to enjoy fresh produce when not in season in the U.S.,  Strohbehn said.  However, each link of the food chain presents opportunity for risk, and mishandling at any step in the farm-to-fork flow can cause an illness. With global transportation, traceability is paramount.  Food producers, processors and manufacturers have two to four years, depending on the size of their operation, to comply with the rules. Shaw is hopeful that the regulations will not create a hardship for smaller producers and force them out of business. She says the process is similar to changes the meat industry faced in the late  90s. While there were challenges, most companies survived the transition.  FDA is really making an effort to ensure that farmers, growers and manufacturers are equipped to handle this rule,  Shaw said.  If we want to have a healthier America, we need to focus on making our food supply safer. We have seen an increased commitment from Iowa-based food and feed companies to ensure their procedures are safer and their employees are trained on safe food handling.  Linda Naeve, program specialist for Iowa State Extension and Outreach; Charles Hurburgh, a professor of agricultural and biosystems engineering; Shannon Coleman, assistant professor of food science and human nutrition; and Joe Hannan, extension field specialist; are also part of the ISU team working with producers on this issue.","Published: October 23, 2015"

The boy had just polished off a giant Gobstopper, a confectionery made of sugary, melt-in-the-mouth layers. Curious about the white coating, Westerhoff, an environmental engineer, pored over the jawbreaker s contents and discovered just how incredibly small the matter was. Among the Gobstopper s ingredients were submicroscopic particles of titanium dioxide, a substance commonly added to plastics, paint, cosmetics and sunscreen. At the time, Westerhoff s lab group at Arizona State University was actively tracking the fate of such particles in municipal wastewater systems across the nation. Titanium dioxide is also a food additive approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Ground to teensy particles measuring just tens of billionths of a meter in size   much smaller than a cell or most viruses   titanium dioxide nanoparticles are frequently added to foods to whiten or brighten color. Weeks after his son s candy-coated encounter, Westerhoff went to the supermarket, pulled more than 100 products off the shelves and analyzed their contents. His findings, published in 2012 show that many processed foods contain titanium dioxide, much of it in the form of nanoparticles. Candies, cookies, powdered doughnuts and icing were among the products with the highest levels. Titanium dioxide is also found in cheese, cereal and Greek yogurt.  I began to question why we care about things in the environment   at a few micrograms per liter in water   if we re freely ingesting these materials,  Westerhoff says. Titanium dioxide isn t the only nanoingredient added to food. Various other materials, reduced to the nanoscale, are sprinkled into food or packaging to enhance color, flavor and freshness. A dash of nano will smooth or thicken liquids or extend the shelf life of some products. Scientists have designed nano-sized capsules to slip beneficial nutrients, such as omega-3 fish oil, into juice or mayonnaise, without the fishy taste. Food scientists aren t stopping there. They are downsizing the structure of a wide array of ingredients with bold plans to help tackle obesity, malnutrition and other health issues. But as scientists cook up ways to create heart-healthy mayo and fat-fighting ice cream, some are also considering the potential risks that might accompany the would-be benefits. Because of their small size, ingested nanoparticles may interact with cells or behave differently than their bulkier counter-parts. So far, less-than-perfect laboratory studies offer contradictory results. Researchers, including those developing nanofoods, say more information is needed on the ingredients  potential impacts. Current studies, limited to mice or lab dishes, often analyze megadoses of particles far beyond what any normal diet would include. Scientists need a better handle on what happens when people nosh on nanolaced foods daily, taking in small doses at a time, says Ohio State University pathologist James Waldman. He and others are devising tests to find out.","Published: October 23, 2015"

The discovery and characterization of these systems is expected to further expand the genome editing toolbox, opening new avenues for biomedical research. The research, published in the journal Molecular Cell, was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health. ""This work shows a path to discovery of novel CRISPR-Cas systems with diverse properties, which are demonstrated here in direct experiments,"" said Eugene Koonin, Ph.D., senior investigator at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), National Library of Medicine (NLM), part of the NIH. ""The most remarkable aspect of the story is how evolution has achieved a broad repertoire of biological activities, a feat we can take advantage of for new genome manipulation tools."" Enzymes from the CRISPR system are revolutionizing the field of genomics, allowing researchers to target specific regions of the genome and edit DNA at precise locations. ""CRISPR"" stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, which are key components of a system used by bacteria to defend against invading viruses. Cas9 - one of the enzymes produced by the CRISPR system - binds to the DNA in a highly sequence-specific manner and cuts it, allowing precise manipulation of a region of DNA. Enzymes such as Cas9 provide researchers with a gene editing tool that is faster, less expensive and more precise than previously developed methods. The three newly-characterized systems share some features with Cas9 and Cpf1, a recently characterized CRISPR enzyme, but have unique properties that could potentially be exploited for novel genome editing applications. This study highlights the diversity of CRISPR systems, which can be leveraged to develop more efficient, effective, and precise ways to edit DNA. The researchers took a novel bioinformatics approach to discover the new proteins, provisionally termed C2c1, C2c2, and C2c3, developing a series of computational approaches to search NIH genomic databases and identify new CRISPR-Cas systems. In addition to Koonin, the research team included Feng Zhang of the MIT-Harvard Broad Institute, Konstantin Severinov of Rutgers and the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Omar Abudayyeh of MIT, and NCBI's Kira Makarova, Sergey Shmakov (also at Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology), and Yuri Wolf. ""There are multiple ways to modify the search algorithm, so more exciting and distinct CRISPR-Cas mechanisms should be expected soon,"" said Severinov. ""These new mechanisms will undoubtedly attract the attention of basic and applied scientists alike."" Initial experimental work exploring the function of these proteins reveals that they are substantially different from the well-characterized Cas9 protein, which has been widely used for genome editing. With the analysis of C2c1, C2c2, and C2c3, the team was able to infer the intricate evolutionary pathway of these adaptive defense systems. ""The collaborative nature of this work highlights the power of bringing together top scientists with diverse strengths to innovate at the interface of computation, molecular biology and evolutionary biology,"" said Zhang. The Koonin and Zhang groups also recently collaborated on a project that resulted in the characterization of Cpf1, a novel CRISPR nuclease that is expected to become an important genome editing tool.   Feng Zhang, of the Broad Institute and MIT, is supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (5DP-MH100706 and 1R01-MH110049) and by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (5R01DK097760-03).

Babbling sounds with consonant-vowel repetitions, such as  dada,  are common among infants once they reach 8 months old; however, these sounds are not prevalent among infants who have profound hearing loss that is, until they receive cochlear implants. Now, University of Missouri (MU) research shows that babies  repetitive babbles primarily are motivated by infants  ability to hear themselves. Additionally, infants with profound hearing loss who received cochlear implants to improve their hearing soon babbled as often as their hearing peers, allowing them to catch up developmentally.  Hearing is a critical aspect of infants  motivation to make early sounds,  said Mary Fagan, an assistant professor of communication science and disorders in the MU School of Health Professions.  The fact that they attend to and learn from their own behaviors, especially in speech, highlights how infants  own experiences help their language, social and cognitive development. This research doesn t diminish the importance of the speech that babies hear from others we know they need to learn from others but it raises our awareness that infants are not just passive recipients of what others say to them. They are actively engaged in their own developmental process.  Fagan studied the babbles of 27 hearing infants and 16 infants with profound hearing loss before and after they received cochlear implants, which are small electronic devices embedded into the bone behind the ear that replace some functions of the damaged inner ear. Before receiving cochlear implants, babies with profound hearing loss rarely produced repetitive vocalizations, such as  ba-ba  or  da-da.  Within a few months of receiving cochlear implants, the number of babies who produced repetitive vocalizations increased, the number of vocalizations that contained repetitive syllables increased, and the number of actual repetitions in the string, such as  ba-ba-ba-ba-ba,  increased, Fagan said.  The research tells us that infants are motivated by hearing the sounds they produce, so these sounds are functional in some way,  Fagan said.  Research conducted by others supports the idea that babies form mental representations of their own babbles, such as these strings of syllables, which may be the reason that infants tend to use the sounds that they have babbled in their first words rather than the sounds that are most common in the speech that adults use with them.  Fagan says parents who have children with profound hearing loss should be well-informed about cochlear implants before making the decision for their children to get the devices.  Many parents elect to have their children with profound hearing loss receive cochlear implants, and that s a decision parents alone can make,  Fagan said.  Whatever decision the parents make, the data strongly show that if parents are going to choose a cochlear implant, the sooner the better. Studies like mine show how rapidly babies with hearing loss respond to cochlear implants, often minimizing the impact on their speech, language and vocabulary development.

But computer scientists and a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Utah have developed software that maps out a monkey's brain and more easily creates a 3-D model, providing a more complete picture of how the brain is wired. Their process was announced this week at Neuroscience 2015, the annual Society for Neuroscience meeting in Chicago. ""If you understand how things are wired in the normal brain, you can use this as a basis to understand how these connections are disrupted in the abnormal brain,"" said Alessandra Angelucci, professor of ophthalmology and visual science at the University of Utah. Getting a more accurate view of the brain's network of neurons can help medical researchers understand how the brain's connectivity is disrupted in mental and neurological conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety and autism. For Angelucci, who works at the University of Utah's Moran Eye Center, this also can aid research on such vision-related conditions as amblyopia, a disorder where one or both eyes lack visual acuity, and various forms of retinal degeneration. Angelucci has been using this software on a monkey's brain because it most closely resembles the human brain. In the past, researchers would have to scan thousands of thin layers of a primate's brain through a microscope in order to get a view of its neurons. There was no practical way to make a 3-D model of the brain from these layers. For example, a high-resolution scan of a part of the brain the size of a penny would generate about two million images all totaling 30 terabytes (30,000 gigabytes) in files. ""It takes a lot of computer power because we now have to reconstruct a three-dimensional image out of this thousands and thousands of images of tissue,"" Angelucci said. ""It was simply impossible because there is no computer or software that can handle that. It involves terabytes and terabytes of data."" A team led by Valerio Pascucci, a professor in the University of Utah's School of Computing and director of the university's Center for Extreme Data Management Analysis and Visualization (CEDMAV) at the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute (SCI), has developed software that can create a 3-D model of an animal's brain that is much quicker and requires less computer power and system memory. The team took an existing software platform CEDMAV created called VISUS (Visualization Streams for Ultimate Scalability) and adapted it to assemble high-resolution images of different sections of the brain into one 3-D model that can be viewed at different angles. VISUS is used to visualize huge sets of data to create weather or energy simulations or high-resolution images of cities. To create images of a brain, researchers first use a new method known as CLARITY that makes the brain tissue transparent by immersing it in special hydrogels. With the new software, hundreds of 3-D blocks of the brain are then scanned one at a time with a two-photon microscope, and scientists can view the scans immediately as opposed to waiting for them to download. With the help of a researcher, the software then can more easily and quickly assemble the blocks into one complete picture of a region of the brain and create a 3-D model that allows the scientist to view areas and angles that couldn't be seen as easily with 2-D images. In this way, researchers can map out the individual neurons and their long tails, known as axons. ""It really unleashes a different level of understanding of the data itself being able to look at something fully in 3-D and to rotate and look at in front and in back,"" Pascucci said. ""We have seen over and over in many fields that this makes people understand more quickly and much better the spatial relationship among all the parts."" With the software, researchers also can monitor the scanning of the brain which can take weeks and make sure that no bad images are created in the process, saving precious time. Thanks to this new tool, medical researchers can now study and better understand how the brain's connectivity is disrupted in abnormal conditions, for example what happens to the brain's neural network resulting from retinal degeneration or conditions such as autism. ""We can view it, reconstruct it and understand its connectivity,"" Angelucci said. ""This software speeds up our ability to do that.""

Furthermore, it is known that sleep plays a very important role in memory formation. Researchers from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have now been able to show for the first time how the pathological changes in the brain act on the information-storing processes during sleep. Using animal models, they were able to decode the exact mechanism and alleviate the impairment with medicinal agents. The sleep slow waves, also known as slow oscillations, which our brain generates at night, have a particular role in consolidating what we have learned and in shifting memories into long-term storage. These waves are formed via a network of nerve cells in the brain's cortex, and then spread out into other parts of the brain, such as the hippocampus. ""These waves are a kind of signal through which these areas of the brain send mutual confirmation to say 'I am ready, the exchange of information can go ahead'. Therefore, there is a high degree of coherence between very distant nerve cell networks during sleep,"" explains Dr. Dr. Marc Aurel Busche, scientist at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at TUM University Hospital Klinikum rechts der Isar and TUM Institute of Neuroscience. Together with Prof. Dr. Arthur Konnerth from the Institute of Neuroscience, he headed the study which was published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. As the researchers discovered, this coherence process is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease. In their study, they used mouse models with which the defects in the brains of Alzheimer's patients can be simulated. The animals form the same protein deposits, known as  -amyloid plaques, which are also visible in human patients. The scientists were now able to show that these plaques directly impair the slow wave activity. ""The slow oscillations do still occur, but they are no longer able to spread properly -- as a result, the signal for the information cross-check is absent in the corresponding regions of the brain,"" is how Marc Aurel Busche summarizes it. The scientists also succeeded in decoding this defect at the molecular level: correct spread of the waves requires a precise balance to be maintained between the excitation and inhibition of nerve cells. In the Alzheimer models, this balance was disturbed by the protein deposits, so that inhibition was reduced. Busche and his team used this knowledge to treat the defect with medication. One group of sleep-inducing drugs, the benzodiazepines, is known to boost inhibitory influences in the brain. If the scientists gave small amounts of this sleep medication to the mice (approximately one-tenth of the standard dose), the sleep slow waves were able to spread out correctly again. In subsequent behavioral experiments, they were able to demonstrate that learning performance had now improved as well. For the researchers, of course, these results are just a first step on the way to a suitable treatment of Alzheimer's disease. ""But, these findings are of great interest for two reasons: firstly, mice and humans have the same sleep oscillations in the brain -- the results are thus transferrable. Secondly, these waves can be recorded with a standard EEG monitor, so that any impairment may also be diagnosed at an early stage,"" concludes the scientist.

The study, published in Nature and partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), paves the way to understanding how defects in the thalamus might underlie symptoms seen in patients with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia.  We are constantly bombarded by information from our surroundings,  said James Gnadt, Ph.D., program director at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).  This study shows how the circuits of the brain might decide which sensations to pay attention to.  Thirty years ago Dr. Francis Crick proposed that the thalamus  shines a light  on regions of the cortex, which readies them for the task at hand, leaving the rest of the brain s circuits to idle in darkness.  We typically use a very small percentage of incoming sensory stimuli to guide our behavior, but in many neurological disorders the brain is overloaded,  said Michael Halassa, M.D., Ph.D., the study s senior author and an assistant professor at New York University s Langone Medical Center.  It gets a lot of sensory input that is not well-controlled because this filtering function might be broken.  Neuroscientists have long believed that an area at the very front of the brain, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), selects what information to focus on, but how this happens remains unknown. One common theory is that neurons in the PFC do this by sending signals to cells in the sensory cortices located on the outer part of the brain. However, Dr. Halassa s team discovered that PFC neurons may instead tune the sensitivity of a mouse brain to sights and sounds by sending signals to inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) cells located deep inside the brain. To study attention, Dr. Halassa s team designed a test that challenged mice to focus and ignore distractions. The researchers trained mice to use either a light or a sound to figure out which of two doors hid a milk reward. Before each decision, the mice heard a noise that told them to anticipate the light or the sound that would lead them to the correct door. The mice then needed to use the right cue and ignore the irrelevant one in order to get their reward. The researchers used genetically modified mice in which specific neurons could be activated or inhibited with rays of light. Silencing neurons in the PFC while the mice anticipated the cue increased errors. The mice chose the wrong door in response to the light or sound cue, implying they could not concentrate in that setting. In contrast, silencing neurons of the visual cortex, the part of the brain that processes visual information, during anticipation had no effect on attention. The mice chose the correct door in response to a light cue. Overall, the results suggested that connections between PFC and sensory cortical neurons were not involved with this type of attention, as previously thought. Instead, further experiments suggested that the TRN played a critical role. Turning on TRN neurons involved in vision during anticipation of the light cue increased errors whereas turning that same circuit off had the opposite effect   the mice had trouble paying attention to the sound but not the light.  We interpreted this to mean that inactivating the visual TRN makes irrelevant visual input much more distracting,  Dr. Halassa said. The team also observed that when mice needed to focus on the light, activity dropped in the visual TRN and increased in the part of the thalamus that processes visual inputs, called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). However, those changes did not happen when the PFC was inactivated. These findings suggested that the PFC modifies activity in the thalamus in order to shift attention toward visual information. To figure out if fluctuations in the TRN and LGN were linked, the researchers developed a new technique called chloride photometry that allowed them to directly monitor how much chloride was entering LGN neurons in real time. The more chloride ions flowed into a neuron, the more inhibited the mice became. The group found that more chloride entered and inhibited the LGN during trials that required mice to ignore the light and focus on the sound.  With this new technique, we can actually watch how circuit problems in the mouse thalamus may lead to problems with concentration that underlie certain neuropsychiatric disorders in humans,  Dr. Halassa said.  This work may provide the mechanistic basis for Dr. Crick s theory of the thalamic searchlight. NIH / National Istitute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke   press release Halassa MM et al.

Instead, it is T cells in the lymphoid tissues that are most susceptible and whose death leads to the progression from HIV infection to AIDS. While 98 percent of CD4 T cells are in the lymphoid tissues, almost all prior studies on HIV have been conducted using blood cells. The scientists say the latest findings should spark greater use of lymphoid tissue T cells to study the pathogenic effects of HIV. Blood cells, which are easier to obtain, do not recapitulate all of the key biology of lymphoid tissue cells.  These results drive home that HIV is a disease of lymphoid tissues, not blood,  says senior author Warner C. Greene, MD, PhD, director of the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology.  As such, greater emphasis must be placed on studying HIV infection within these lymphoid tissues; that s where the virus is replicating and spreading. Over the past 30 years, scientists have largely studied HIV using blood cells because of ease of acquisition, so there may be significant, fundamental biology that we ve missed. For example, if we had restricted our research to blood-derived cells, we would have missed primary cell death pathway operating during HIV infection.  Previous research from the Greene laboratory revealed that the main cause of cell death in HIV involves a programmed cell death pathway called pyroptosis, where the cells commit a particularly fiery form of suicide in self-defense to prevent the spread of the virus. When the virus invades a cell that is  at rest,  the infection is aborted. However, fragments of viral DNA accumulate and are detected by the resting host cell through the sentry protein IFI16. This triggers a domino effect in the cell s defense system, resulting in the initiation of pyroptosis. Remarkably, blood CD4 T cells are resistant to this death pathway, in part because the cells are in a deeper state of rest, meaning the virus is unable to infect them completely, which prevents the onset of the chain of events that leads to pyroptosis. Additionally, the blood cells have less of the enzyme IFI16that detects viral DNA fragments in the cell.  Because the blood cells both accumulate less viral DNA and express less IFI16, there is nothing to be  sensed  and nothing to sense it with,  says first author Isa Munoz-Arias, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at the Gladstone Institutes.  Together, these findings indicate that only small amounts of viral DNA accumulate in the cell, so the virus remains undetected. As such, the pyroptotic response never occurs.  In a curious twist resembling cellular alchemy, when blood T cells are cultured with lymphoid tissue from the tonsils or spleen, the blood T cells begin acting like lymphoid tissue T cells, becoming more activated and more susceptible to abortive infection and death by pyroptosis. Thus, blood cells can become sensitive to this death pathway if they come into contact with lymphoid cells, as would occur when blood CD4 T cells traffic into lymphoid tissues. Based on this finding, the researchers believe there must be a signal from the lymphoid tissue cells that influences the blood T cells when they are cultured together, causing the blood cells to behave like lymphoid tissue cells.  However, when the blood cells were separated from the lymphoid tissue, they regained their resistance to pyroptosis. These findings suggest pyroptosis sensitization requires continuous cell-to cell signaling between the lymphoid tissue and blood T cells, and sensitivity is rapidly lost when this signaling is interrupted.  The scientists report that the next step is to identify this cell-to cell signal and attempt to block it using small molecules. Successfully doing so could instill lymphoid T cells with the same immunity to pyroptosis found in blood T cells, potentially rendering the body resistant to cell death by HIV. What s more, the discovery of such a fundamental difference in the biology of blood and lymphoid tissue CD4 T cells opens the door to retesting drugs in lymphoid tissue that were deemed ineffective in blood cells. This might be particularly important in research aimed at finding a definitive cure for HIV.","Published: October 22, 2015"

The discovery was made possible by identifying the metabolic programs used by cancer cells to fuel their growth. The findings point to possible new avenues for treating lung cancer, which is the second most common cancer and accounts for over one-quarter of all cancer-related deaths.  What cancer cells 'eat' The metabolism of cancer cells is very different from normal cells. Rapid proliferation means that cancer cells have increased energetic needs. This need is met using glucose (sugar) as the main source of nutrition. Cancer cells use glucose at rates tens or even hundreds of times larger than that of normal cells. When glucose becomes scarce, however, cancer cells must switch to using alternative sources of nutrition to maintain their growth and survival. A team of scientists from McGill University, Washington University in St. Louis, ITMO University in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and the University of Bristol in the UK studied the response of cancer cells to reduced availability of glucose, the main fuel source for most cancer cells. The group chose to experiment with one of the most common types of lung cancer - non-small cell lung cancer, which affects 85-90 percent of all lung cancer victims. They found that some lung cancer cells change their food preferences - switching from glucose to the amino acid glutamine - when sugar is scarce. The researchers found that cancer cells use an enzyme known as PEPCK to reprogram cancer cell metabolism. ""Until recently, PEPCK has only been extensively studied in specialized tissues that make glucose, such as the liver,"" says Emma Vincent, Research Associate at McGill University and lead author of the study. ""We found that some cancer cells also express PEPCK, and this confers to them the ability to convert glutamine into energy and building blocks to support their growth. By making this metabolic switch, PEPCK allows cancer cells not just to survive, but to continue to proliferate under starvation conditions."" The scientists demonstrated that blocking PEPCK in cancer cells could slow tumor growth in mice. Alternative fuels for cancer cells The group also found evidence of increased PEPCK levels in tissues from lung-cancer patients. ""The fact that PEPCK levels are elevated in some cases of human lung cancer suggests that this enzyme may play a role in the human disease,"" adds Russell Jones, Associate Professor of Physiology at McGill University's Goodman Cancer Research Centre. The study suggests that nutrient availability in the organism, where cancer cells must compete for glucose and other nutrients, can impact cancer progression. ""Our work shows that cancers can use alternative fuel sources to help drive their growth under stressful conditions,"" notes Prof. Jones. ""This remarkable flexibility is part of what makes cancer so deadly, but offers hope in finding new therapies."" ""Understanding the mechanisms used by cancer cells to adapt to their environment creates new possibilities to treat this deadly disease,"" explains Alexey Sergushichev, bioinformatician and PhD student at the Department of Computer Technologies at ITMO University. ""We hope our work on PEPCK and the metabolic alterations in lung cancer cells will lead to innovations in treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, one of the most deadly types of cancer.""","Published: October 22, 2015"

But when viruses cause severe disease, doctors have few options for effective treatment. Studying mice with a variety of viral infections, scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have demonstrated a way to dial up the body s innate immune defenses while simultaneously attacking a protein that many viruses rely on to replicate. The findings reveal previously unknown weapons in the body s antiviral immune arsenal and provide guidelines for designing drugs that could be effective against a broad range of viruses. The strategy involves enhancing the body s interferon signaling system, long understood to be a vital part of antiviral defenses. We ve discovered a new component of the interferon system,  said senior author Michael J. Holtzman, MD, the Selma and Herman Seldin Professor of Medicine.  It does something that other components don t do, and it works on both sides of the fence: It dials up the body s internal genes that fight viruses, and it attacks viral proteins directly.  Holtzman and lead author Yong Zhang, PhD, an instructor in pulmonary medicine, suspect that the researchers  one-two punch against the virus may explain the large difference in survival rates between control mice and mice genetically engineered to have increased signaling in their interferon systems. When infected with encephalomyocarditis virus, which causes severe damage to vital organs including the brain, heart and pancreas, 97 percent of the genetically engineered mice survived, compared with none of the control mice. Even when the concentration of the injected virus was increased 100-fold, 82 percent of the genetically altered mice survived. And at 100-fold lower concentrations, all genetically engineered mice survived the infection, compared with only 25-28 percent of the control mice. Holtzman pointed out that past research by other groups has shown that increasing the amount of interferon directly results in some improvements in fighting viruses, but not to the same extent as the current work. In addition, more modest improvements shown by other investigators usually are accompanied by autoimmune problems resulting from the chronically activated immune response. Despite the strong antiviral immune response seen in the new study, Holtzman and his colleagues reported no evidence of autoimmune disease in these mice. Holtzman said a possible explanation for the impressive survival rates and absence of destructive autoimmunity could be that the researchers  strategy did not involve increasing the amount of interferon, the first step of this important antiviral signaling cascade. Instead, it dialed up amounts of the protein STAT1, the second component of this cascade, without altering the system s overall interferon on/off switch.  Past work to boost this system just kept the interferon signal on all the time,  Holtzman said.  When the system is chronically activated, it is no longer regulated, and that s where the autoimmune problems may come from. Our system is still regulated by the presence or absence of interferon. Interferon amounts increase when there is an infection and decrease when there is no infection. We re not boosting interferon itself, but the secondary signal that interferon activates, which sets off the rest of the antiviral cascade. It s like greasing the wheels. We re not pushing the system any harder. But when we do push, we get a bigger effect.  Analyzing the mice, the researchers found that the genetic alteration that confers these benefits turns on a set of molecules called PARP9-DTX3L. This molecular complex activates genes specifically designed to fight viruses. And, separate from its role in activating genes, the complex also seeks out and destroys an important viral protein called 3C protease, the scientists found. Many viruses including the common cold virus rely on this protein to replicate and continue their destructive march through the body.  This dual mechanism of action is a great guideline for how we would like to build a new antiviral drug,  Holtzman said.  We want something that affects both host and virus. We already have drug candidates we can screen to see if they target this part of the system. ","Published: October 22, 2015"

Vasculitis, or inflammation of the blood vessels, is an autoimmune disease that can lead to serious organ damage, especially in the kidneys.  For the first time, our research has uncovered a new role for mast cells and their effect in non-allergic inflammatory kidney disease,  said lead study author Dr Gan.  Mast cells are immune cells that are traditionally thought to be responsible for allergic diseases such as asthma, hay fever, and food allergy including anaphylaxis.  While mast cells are important in suppressing autoimmunity, they can also make autoimmune diseases such as vasculitis worse.  Using disodium cromoglycate in a mouse model of vasculitis stabilises the harmful effects of mast cells and leaves their immune modifying effect intact,  said lead co-author Ms O Sullivan.  I also studied kidney biopsies from patients with vasculitis and found that activated mast cells were prominent, suggesting they play an injurious role in the human disease.  Disodium cromoglycate, commonly used in Europe for allergic conditions including asthma, is relatively cheap and has very few side effects.  This research shows we may be able to repurpose an existing drug for different forms of inflammation,  said Head of the Centre for Inflammatory Diseases, Professor Richard Kitching.  Current treatments for vasculitis suppress the immune system and have many nasty side-effects, however, disodium cromoglycate is a non-toxic medication that may dampen acute flares of vasculitis.  Importantly, this breakthrough research may lead to a treatment for vasculitis that effectively manages inflammation and symptoms while not suppressing the immune system.

That small difference explains why boys are more at risk for a range of disorders -- from autism to hemophilia -- linked to genetic defects on their lone X chromosome. Meanwhile, most girls who carry the same defect on one X chromosome don t get sick, because their other X chromosome runs the show. Now, a new genetic discovery could help scientists understand exactly how this silencing of one X happens   and perhaps lead to better treatment for X-linked diseases. In a team of scientists from the University of Michigan Medical School shows that the genetic material in female (but not male) cells makes tiny amounts of a special genetic material called RNA to make one of the two X chromosomes silent. They call this RNA XistAR. Back in biology class, you probably learned that RNAs make proteins in cells. But XistAR is special. It belongs to a class of RNAs called lncRNAs, or long noncoding RNAs, that don t make proteins, but instead control how our genetic code gets read.X marks the spot The question that U-M geneticist Sundeep Kalantry, Ph.D., and his team set out to answer was: how do female cells turn off one of their two X chromosomes? They knew that a gene called Xist causes cells to make a kind of lncRNA that coats the  silenced  X and keeps it dormant. But how is Xist lncRNA itself made? Genes can be  read  in both the forward and the backward direction. The Kalantry team found that the Xist gene on the otherwise  silent  X chromosome is read in both the forward and, unexpectedly, in the backward direction. This makes the RNA they dubbed XistAR, short for  XistActivating RNA . Production of XistAR in the backward direction is required to generate Xist RNA in the forward direction and turn off the X chromosome. To prove the discovery, the team had to develop a new kind of test to detect such RNA strands, which cells make in much smaller amounts than the forward-reading variety. The test could now help scientists look at other places in the genome for more examples of rare lncRNAs -- made in the backward or  antisense  direction -- that regulate the genetic code. The work was done in mice, which allowed the scientists to see what happened when they kept cells from making XistAR. Without it, the cells couldn t silence one X chromosome effectively, and they made too much of the X-chromosome gene products in females. Promise for the future If the discovery translates to humans   and XistAR seems to also be present in humans -- Kalantry believes that XistAR may provide a convenient handle to manipulate X chromosome genes.  For example, it could be possible to boost proteins generated by the X chromosome s genes by stopping XistAR from working. He and his team are now looking for factors that control XistAR activity.  This work sheds light into how lncRNAs function, how genes and even an entire chromosome can be quieted. XistAR provides a molecular target to control gene expression   how to  wake the genes up  or reduce their activity,  says Kalantry.  Exploring how the X chromosome becomes inactivated lets us know how to selectively activate it. Turning on the healthy copy of an X chromosome gene maybe a way to minimize disease risks associated with the X chromosome.  Meanwhile, he says, understanding how antisense lncRNAs can work in an  epigenetic  way   acting as an outside force on DNA to control whether it gets read or not   can apply far beyond the X-chromosome. Calico cats and autism Kalantry, an assistant professor in the U-M Department of Human Genetics, keeps a portrait of a calico cat on his office wall. It reminds him of the power of X-chromosome inactivation. In such cats, nearly all of them female, patches of fur of different colors grow from different regions of skin. The color of each patch depends on which X-chromosome has been turned off and which is on in those hair-producing cells   whether it s the one inherited from the cat s mother or the one from the father.   X-inactivation, also called Lyonization, happens in the earliest stages of a female embryo s development. Once each cell in the tiny clump of embryonic cells has  decided  which X to silence, all the cells that ever develop from that cell also inactivate copies of the same X. Unlike calico cats, however, the effects of inactivating the  healthy  X chromosome more often than the  unhealthy  one can really change a girl s life. For example, autism is heavily linked to genetic problems on the X-chromosome, which explains why boys, with only one X chromosome, are more than four times as likely as girls to fall on the autistic spectrum. Another autism-like disorder, called Rett syndrome, occurs only in girls, when a mutated gene on one of their X chromosomes gets used. Next steps While the new discovery does not immediately show a path to treating autism or Rett syndrome by altering activity of  unhealthy  X chromosomes, it does pave the way for further research. Strategies to block RNA strands in cells are already being tested in clinical trials. Kalantry notes that the new work immediately opens up ways to find short-lived lncRNAs such as XistAR. The team developed ways to  tag  such strands to make them detectable.  The control of genes by lncRNAs, often via epigenetic means, is now appreciated to occur in a wide variety of contexts, from normal physiology to diseases. On a fundamental level, it controverts the central dogma of DNA begetting RNA, which then makes proteins,  says Kalantry.  The techniques we ve developed facilitate the discovery of rare RNA species in a cell. Such RNAs have been missed by high-throughput sequencing approaches, but maybe essential for cell function.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/gene-onoff-switch-works-like-backpack-strap-195566,Gene On Off Switch Works Like Backpack Strap Texas Medical Center based team unravels how loops form in genome  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A research team based in Houston s Texas Medical Center has found that the proteins that turn genes on by forming loops in human chromosomes work like the sliding plastic adjusters on a grade-schooler s backpack. This discovery could provide new clues about genetic diseases and allow researchers to reprogram cells by directly modifying the loops in genomes. The study is by the same team that published the first high-resolution 3-D maps showing how the human genome folds inside the nucleus of a cell. The multi-institutional group includes researchers from Baylor College of Medicine, Rice University, Stanford University and the Broad Institute. Every human cell contains a genome, a linear string of DNA. Sequences of DNA bases spell out genes, much like letters spell out words. For decades, scientists have known that genes that lie far apart on the string can activate one another by looping back and coming into contact during genome folding. Last year, the team showed that it was possible to map the positions of these loops, and the researchers created the first atlas of loops in the human genome. But the group couldn t explain how the loops were forming. For months, we had no idea what our data really meant,  said senior author Erez Lieberman Aiden, a geneticist and computer scientist with joint appointments at Baylor and Rice.  Then one day, we realized that we d been carrying the solution around   literally, on our back   for decades!  The human genome contains more than 20,000 genes. In any given cell, only a fraction of these are active, and this fraction determines the cell s function: whether it will become a hard-pumping heart cell, a body-defending immune cell or a metastatic cancer cell. Many genes are activated by loops, and it is impossible to understand gene activation without knowing how loops form, Aiden said. Aiden, who is also a senior investigator at Rice s Center for Theoretical Biological Physics, said the researchers found that a set of proteins acts like the plastic slider, sometimes called a tri-glide, that adjusts a backpack strap.  The mechanism that makes this possible can be explained to any kindergartener with a backpack,  said study co-first author Adrian Sanborn, a graduate student in the Aiden lab and at Stanford University.  The protein complex that forms DNA loops appears to operate like the plastic slider that is used to adjust the length of the straps: it lands on DNA and takes up slack to form a loop.  Aiden, assistant professor of genetics at Baylor and of computer science and computational and applied mathematics at Rice, said Sanborn and study co-first author Suhas Rao showed that they could combine the tri-glide model with mathematics and high-performance computation to predict how a genome will fold. The team confirmed their predictions by making tiny modifications in a cell s genome and showing that the mutations changed the folding pattern exactly as expected. Rao likened the result to a new form of genome surgery: a procedure that can modify how a genome is folded by design and with extraordinary precision.  We found that changing even one letter in the genetic code was enough to modify the folding of millions of other letters,  said Rao, a graduate student in the Aiden lab and at Stanford University.  What was stunning was that once we understood how the loops were forming, the results of these changes became extremely predictable.  Sanborn said the discovery also explains a puzzling pattern that the team noticed when it published its original atlas of loops.  DNA encodes information, and you can think of each DNA base pair as a letter and of certain sequences of letters as words,  he said.  In our data, we noticed that when particular keywords appeared, a loop would form. But the loop would only form if the two keywords were pointing at one another. For example, if one side of the loop read K-E-Y-W-O-R-D, the other would be D-R-O-W-Y-E-K.   That s an incredibly strange thing because these words can be millions of letters apart, and the genome is flexible at that scale,  said Sanborn.  If I were a protein, and I wanted to bring these two words together, it s difficult to envision why the way that the keyword is pointing would matter. This simple fact was a crucial clue.  That clue eventually led the team to the tri-glide theory, but not before a series of false starts. First, the team tested models based on fractal packing, but they proved mathematically that such packing could not explain the data. Next, the researchers tested a model of DNA folding where tension along the DNA chain caused it to condense like an elastic band, but this model also did not fit the data. Eventually, they hit on the tri-glide model. The basic idea is that the tri-glide protein complex lands on the genome and pulls the strand from each side so that a loop forms in the middle   just like the loop someone might make if they wanted to tighten a backpack strap.  The strand just keeps feeding through and feeding through from each direction until it hits the keyword, which acts like a brake,  said Rao, a student in the Aiden lab and at Stanford University.  So it s not so much that the keywords need to point at one another; it s that they need to point at the tri-glide complex because the complex won t recognize them if they point the other way. To the complex, they would look upside-down.  Aiden said that one of the most astonishing implications of the new model is that loops on different chromosomes tend not to become entangled.  In the old model, scientists thought that a loop formed when two bits of the genome wiggled around and then met inside the cell nucleus,  Aiden said.  But this process would lead to interweaving loops and highly entangled chromosomes. This is a big problem if you need those chromosomes to separate again when the cell divides.  The tri-glide takes care of that,  he said.  Even in a big pile of backpacks, you can use your tri-glide to make a loop without any risk of entanglement. ","Published: October 22, 2015"

Work from Prof. Gotam Jarori's lab has earlier shown that this protein, enolase, is a protective antigen and has several other functions that are essential for parasite growth and multiplication.Taking this a step further, in a recently published paper in the Malaria Journal, they have shown that a small part of this protein, that is unique to parasite enolase and is absent in human enolases, has protective antigenic properties. ""As enolase was implicated in invasion of red blood cells of the host as well as the midgut of mosquitoes, antibodies against this small fragment can potentially have a dual benefit by blocking the multiplication cycle of the parasite in humans, as well as inhibiting transmission through mosquitoes"", says Prof. Jarori. The work was carried out in collaboration with Prof. Shiladitya DasSarma's laboratory at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA, who has developed Archaeal gas vesicle nanoparticles (GVNPs). The small unique segment of enolase was genetically fused to a nanoparticle protein and this conjugated system was used to vaccinate mice. Interestingly, a subsequent challenge with a lethal strain of mouse malaria parasite in these vaccinated animals showed considerable protection against malaria. Says Prof. DasSarma, PhD, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the school, ""GVNPs offer a designer platform for vaccines and this work is a significant step forward towards a new malaria vaccine."" This study is a significant advance in the field, since most other vaccine candidate molecules tested so far confer protection against only a single species of parasite, due to the species and strain specific nature of these molecules. ""The small segment of five amino acids that forms a protective epitope is present in all human malaria causing species of Plasmodium and hence, antibodies directed against it are likely to protect against all species of the parasite"", says Sneha Dutta, a graduate student at TIFR who conducted these experiments. Efforts are now focused at developing this into an effective vaccine against malaria.","Published: October 22, 2015"

The trial of the revolutionary new  gene silencing  treatment is being led by scientists at UCL s Institute of Neurology. Huntington s is a deadly degenerative brain disease that strikes in the prime of life. It kills brain cells, slowly draining patients of their movement control, personality and thinking skills. It is one of the commonest genetic brain diseases and devastates whole families. Everyone with the gene for the disease will fall ill with Huntington s disease at some point. There is no cure, and there is currently no treatment that can prevent it or slow it down. The new drug, called ISIS-HTTRx, targets the root cause of the disease, a toxic protein called mutant huntingtin, which is caused by a faulty gene in the patients  brain cells.The drug is administered directly into the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord at the base of the patients  spine, from where it migrates to the brain. In Huntington s patients, the faulty gene produces messenger molecules, called messenger RNA, that trigger the production of mutant huntingtin in the brain. But the drug is designed to bind with the messenger molecules, forcing the cells to dispose of them instead of churning out the toxic protein. This type of treatment is known as an  antisense  drug. In theory, ISIS-HTTRx could prevent or possibly reverse the toxic effects of the protein, stopping the disease in its tracks. This new human trial is focused on testing the safety of the drug in volunteer patients who are in the very early stages of Huntington s disease. The study will evaluate the safety of increasing doses of ISIS-HTTRx compared to placebo. In addition, researchers will be looking for chemical signs that the drug is having the desired effect, by measuring the level of mutant huntingtin protein in the cerebrospinal fluid using a newly-developed test. The final assessment of whether the drug is effective will take place in later phases of testing. However research on mice that produce the mutant huntingtin protein has been extremely promising. These mice display symptoms similar to those seen in patients with Huntington s disease. When these mice were dosed with ISIS-HTTRx, they showed improvements without serious side-effects. Professor Sarah Tabrizi, director of the Huntington s disease Centre at UCL Institute of Neurology, is leading the trial. She said:  I m thrilled that this antisense drug has now been safely administered to the first patients. Families ravaged by Huntington s disease have been waiting for this milestone for decades. I look forward to ensuring the smooth running of this first trial and hopefully seeing ISIS-HTT-Rx through to efficacy testing and licensing.  The drug is being developed by Isis Pharmaceuticals in collaboration with Roche. In the UK, the first doses of the drug were administered at UCL s new Leonard Wolfson Experimental Neurology Centre. Cath Stanley, Chief Executive of the Huntington s Disease Association of England and Wales, welcomed the news that the first doses of ISIS-HTTRx had been given to Huntington s patients.  As well as being desperate for good news, the Huntington s community is uniquely well-informed and engaged with progress in research across the world,  she said.  RNA-targeting approaches are especially exciting because they tackle the problem at its source   the production of the mutant huntingtin protein. The ISIS-HTTRx trial has been eagerly awaited for many years and we hope that the news from the trial continues to be positive. ","Published: October 22, 2015"

Rice bioengineer David Zhang and his colleagues have developed a unique way to adjust their nucleic acid probe reagents on the fly and take a reliable count of target sequences. The ability to identify DNA or RNA sequences, especially mutations, has become critically important for the detection of diseases and design of therapies to treat them. But finding a specific biomarker in a massive amount of genetic code is hard.Zhang and his team at Rice's BioScience Research Collaborative have become specialists in finding such needles in haystacks. In previous work, the lab designed probes that find single-nucleotide mutations in DNA while using ""competing"" probes to bind to healthy sequences and effectively get them out of the way. This time the lab is developing synthetic DNA ""protectors"" that mimic the target sequence and compete with the target in binding to the probes. By altering the stoichiometry, or the proportion of substances in chemical reactions, of these protectors, researchers can control the balance of the reactions so the fluorescent probes' brightness can be adjusted. For example, Zhang said, there may be two biomarker sequences of interest, but the high expression of one would outshine the low expression of another. Because the unit brightness of each biomarker can be adjusted, the researchers' new method allows the simultaneous and accurate observation of many biomarkers. ""In principle, we should be able to tune indefinitely,"" he said. ""But we'd be trading off time and labor and cost versus what people actually need. If we can get 90 percent of the value in two steps, it probably doesn't make sense to take five more steps for 95 percent."" Zhang, lead authors Lucia Wu and J. Sherry Wang and their colleagues have written software to help researchers design their own probes. The Web-based program allows researchers to cut and paste gene sequences and highlight areas of interest to generate probe designs. The program is free to use and available at http://nablab.rice.edu/nabtools/. Probe design is complicated by the fact that researchers often look for many biomarkers at once, and that those biomarkers interact with each other, Zhang said. ""In an age of advancing science and big data, we want to look at hundreds or thousands or millions of different DNA biomarker signatures. ""Researchers have to decide in advance whether to measure how sensitive the target sequences are to their probes, or how specific they will be when binding,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, these two goals are mutually exclusive. If you improve the sensitivity, the specificity drops, and vice versa. ""What we've done is alter the sensitivity and specificity of different probes in a way that's independent and decoupled,"" he said. ""We like to envision DNA as a plate of food, and our molecules as salt and pepper shakers: We change the flavor of the DNA probe by salting it with a little more stoichiometry or peppering it with a little more of the protector. ""That's a reasonable analogy for what we're doing: going in and changing the formulation, changing the stoichiometric ratios of things. That actually allows us to change the sensitivity and specificity of each individual probe."" In one of many successful tests, the lab designed molecules to detect mutation sequences in historic biopsy samples preserved in wax from cancer patients. One of the researchers' goals is to design noninvasive cancer diagnostics that detect DNA biomarkers in blood samples for early screening and early recurrence detection. Zhang expects the method to find wide use. ""We want to provide better, faster and cheaper answers for researchers and clinicians who are looking at hundreds or thousands of different mutations,"" he said. He and Wang have co-founded a startup company, Searna Technologies, to further develop and commercialize the technology and apply it to cancer detection.","Published: October 22, 2015"

Galapagos discovered multiple C2 corrector compound series, each with a different chemical scaffold and corresponding unique and complementary mode of action. GLPG2665 is the first candidate to complete the potential triple combination therapy for the delta F508 (class II) mutation in cystic fibrosis. GLPG2665 will now enter pre-clinical development, and is expected to enter Phase 1 studies by mid 2016. GLPG2665 in combination with corrector GLPG2222 and potentiator GLPG1837 consistently have shown restoration of healthy activity level in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells of patients with the Class II F508del mutation. The combination resulted in chloride transport up to six-fold greater than Orkambi in HBE cells with the homozygous F508del mutation. Poor functioning of the CFTR channel is the major deficit in patients with cystic fibrosis. ""This is a critical step in the development of our cystic fibrosis portfolio,"" said Onno van de Stolpe, CEO of Galapagos. ""The collaboration with AbbVie delivered novel corrector GLPG2665, the first of multiple correctors to complement our triple combination therapy.

The company takes on the management of other CDMOs, whilst serving as the single, central point of customer contact. This model enables Aesica to reduce the number of CDMOs which previously the customer had to manage. Moreover, the company can identify which are the most strategically useful and effective CDMOs to engage in projects, significantly enhancing value for money to its contractors. The industry solution, which streamlines processes and creates a much simplified supply chain structure, achieves pharma s goal of reducing the overall number of supplier relationships, whilst at the same time maintaining a consistent outsourcing approach across an entire portfolio. It also serves to guarantee On Time In Full (OTIF) product delivery, optimize efficiency, eliminate waste and supply shortages, and to achieve significant cost savings. Moreover, full visibility is achieved across the entire end-to-end manufacturing process. This new solution significantly speeds up time to market. For example, Aesica hosted a 3 way 6 SIGMA workshop, for a project with a customer and another engaged CDMO, the outcomes of which was overall supply lead-time reduced from 180 days to just 45. Aesica already manages a portfolio of more than 10 different CDMOs and has assigned its own dedicated team responsible for ensuring total process management across an entire supply chain. This includes procurement to manage the relationship, risk assessment and price negotiations between customers, Aesica and the other CDMOs. Moreover, the team is charged with responsibility for quality to manage QC and QA activities and the supply chain to manage the delivery of components, including API for bulk production at the CDMO and then onward delivery to various sites for final processing   for which an Aesica external manufacturing director is appointed to lead. The model is primarily geared to small and medium sized CDMOs, facing the same price pressures as big pharma, whilst lacking all the skill sets and resources required for managing multiple CDMOs. It is also suited to companies that have diverse portfolios with affiliates or licensees based across multiple geographic regions. The process of selecting and reducing the number of CDMOs needed to implement projects requires minimal costs or risk to the customer with very limited tech transfer and regulatory hurdles to contend with. Garry Hodges, Operations Director at Aesica Pharmaceuticals commented:  We are very pleased to have brought our new business model to the market to help meet the pressing demand from the pharma market for solutions that improve, streamline and significantly simplify their supply chains. Our business model helps our customers to lower their costs, reduce risk and to be faster to market.  He continued:  Indeed, effective supply chain management is critical to ensuring that products are supplied to the market at the volumes and cost demanded. ","Published: October 21, 2015"

""In the midst of this awful tragedy, there were many acts of bravery and life-saving aid,"" said lead author Glenn Fox, a post-doctoral researcher at the Brain and Creativity Institute (BCI) at the University of Southern California (USC) who led the study. ""With the Holocaust, we only typically associate the awful things. But when you listen to the survivors, you also hear stories of incredible virtue, and gratitude for the help they received."" The study sheds new light on a very under-studied subject, said the study's senior author Antonio Damasio, director of the BCI and Dornsife Neuroimaging Institute at USC, and professor of psychology and neurology at USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. ""There has not been much attention given to the emotion of gratitude, and yet it is extremely important in social behavior,"" Damasio said. ""Gratitude rewards generosity and maintains the cycle of healthy social behavior."" Using multiple recordings of testimony from the vast archives of the USC Shoah Foundation, the team of researchers designed a brain-scan study to test and track gratitude in 23 study subjects, most of them in their 20s, who had no personal connections to the Holocaust. Stimulating feelings of gratitude like the survivors had felt required some preparation for the study subjects. To immerse them in the history of the Holocaust, researchers showed brief documentaries that explained the chronology of the Holocaust: the rise of Nazism and persecution; internment; the Final Solution; the final months and the Liberation. This approach mimicked the visitor experience of the U.S. Holocaust Museum. The researchers also developed second-person scenarios based on the survivors' stories about someone giving them something -- such as a place to hide or a pair of shoes -- that helped them survive. After showing the documentaries, researchers posed the transcribed stories to the subjects such as: ""You have been sick for weeks. A prisoner who is a doctor finds medicine and saves your life."" The participants rated the depth of their gratitude in 50 such scenarios. With the MRI scanner, the researchers were able to map gratitude's circuitry in the brain. ""They had an experience of gratitude as they imagined themselves in the situation,"" Fox said. Fox said he and the other researchers found that when the brain feels gratitude, it activates areas responsible for feelings of reward, moral cognition, subjective value judgments, fairness, economic decision-making and self-reference. (These areas include the ventral- and dorsal- medial pre-frontal cortex, as well as the anterior cingulate cortex). In addition to the findings, the subjects reported another benefit of the study: They had, as a result, a much better understanding about the Holocaust and greater empathy for the survivors. ""When they gave testimony to USC Shoah Foundation many Holocaust survivors told us that they found reason to be grateful, whether it was because of a stranger offering a bit of food or a neighbor providing a place to hide,"" said USC Shoah Foundation Executive Director Stephen Smith. ""These small acts of generosity helped them hold on to their humanity. That Glenn has been able to use testimonies in his incredible research on gratitude shows why it is so important to preserve the voices of people who lived through these dark times."" Prior studies on gratitude, as well as ancient philosophers, have implied that gratitude is beneficial for health, wellbeing and relationships. Fox said he is exploring those effects for additional studies. University of Southern California   press release Damasio A et al. Neural correlates of gratitude.

""Our method is the first to be able to reveal this structure without our knowing an external stimulus ahead of time. We've now shown that our new method will allow us to explore the organizational structure of neurons without knowing their function in advance."" ""The traditional methods used by researchers to analyze the relationship between the activities of neurons were adopted from physics,"" said Carina Curto, associate professor of mathematics at Penn State, ""but neuroscience data doesn't necessarily play by the same rules as data from physics, so we need new tools. Our method is a first step toward developing a new mathematical toolkit to uncover the structure of neural circuits with unknown function in the brain."" The method clique topology was developed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers at Penn State, the University of Pennsylvania, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  The method is described in a paper that will be posted in the early online edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this week. ""We have adopted approaches from the field of algebraic topology that previously had been used primarily in the domain of pure mathematics and have applied them to experimental data on the activity of place cells -- specialized neurons in the part of the brain called the hippocampus that sense the position of an animal in its environment,"" said Curto. The researchers measured the activity of place cells in the brains of rats during three different experimental conditions. They then analyzed the pairwise correlations of this activity how the firing of each neuron was related to the firing of every other neuron. In the first condition, the rats were allowed to roam freely in their environment a behavior where the activity of place cells is directly related to the location of the animal in its environment. They searched the data to find groups of neurons, or ""cliques,"" in which the activity of all members of the clique was related to the activity of every other member. Their analysis of these cliques, using methods from algebraic topology, revealed an organized geometric structure. Surprisingly, the researchers found similar structure in the activities among place cells in the other two conditions they tested, wheel-running and sleep, where place cells are not expected to have geometric organization. ""Because the structure we detected was similar in all three experimental conditions, we think that we are picking up the fundamental organization of place cells in the hippocampus,"" said Itskov.

The findings contribute to the groundwork needed to move gene therapy forward into clinical trials for people with the blinding eye disorder, for which there is currently no cure. Scientists from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Florida, Gainesville also determined for the first time that gene therapy may be of potential benefit even after there has been significant loss of cells in the eye. Up to this point, animal studies had shown benefits from gene therapy only when it was used in the earliest stages of the disease. ""The study shows that a corrective gene can stop the loss of photoreceptors in the retina, and provides good proof of concept for gene therapy at the intermediate stage of the disease, thus widening the therapeutic window,"" said Neeraj Agarwal, Ph.D., a program director at NEI. Retinitis pigmentosa is the most common inherited disease that causes degeneration of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye. Roughly 1 in 4,000 people are affected and about 10 to 20 percent have a particularly severe form called X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, which predominately affects males, causing night blindness by age 10 and progressive loss of the visual field by age 45. About 70 percent of people with the X-linked form carry mutations that cause loss of function of the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase Regulator (RPGR) gene, which encodes a protein important for maintaining the health of photoreceptors. These are cells in the retina that absorb and convert light into electrical signals, which are then sent to the brain. The disease damages both types of photoreceptors: rods (which allow us to see in dim and dark light) and cones (which allow for seeing fine detail and color). To overcome the effects of RPGR mutations, the researchers packaged healthy RPGR genes into an adeno-associated virus that is not known to cause any human diseases. The aim is for the virus to deliver the genes into retinal cells and for the genes to produce the RPGR protein. The researchers then tested the gene therapy in a naturally occurring canine form of RPGR X-linked retinitis pigmentosa that appears among some mixed breeds. Dogs with early to late stages of the disease were treated with the therapy in one eye; the untreated eye was evaluated as the control. Their results are published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Serial imaging suggested that the therapy halted the thinning of the retinal layer where photoreceptors are located and that commonly degenerates from the disease. Using immunolabeling, a technique that helps tag features inside cells, the researchers showed that the structure of rod and cone photoreceptors was improved in the treated eye and better preserved when compared to the untreated eye. Electrical recordings from the retina also suggested that the therapy preserved cell function. Overall, the findings suggest that gene therapy halted disease-associated cell death for at least the length of the 2.5-year study. Even in dogs with later-stage disease, gene therapy halted the loss of retinal thickness and preserved the structure of surviving photoreceptors. By contrast, untreated eyes continued to lose retinal thickness and photoreceptor function. Visual performance under dim light in an obstacle course, and in a maze that required detecting a dim light, were also significantly better in dogs using their treated eye compared with the untreated eye. Before the therapy can be tested in people, additional research is needed to assess its safety and the risk for potential toxicity, said the study's co-leaders, Gustavo Aguirre, V.M.D., Ph.D., and William Beltran, D.V.M., Ph.D., of the University of Pennsylvania. In the meantime, study collaborators, Artur Cideciyan, Ph.D., and Samuel Jacobson, M.D., Ph.D., also at the University of Pennsylvania are carefully evaluating patients with RPGR mutations in preparation for a future clinical trial.","Published: October 20, 2015"

The two companies are known for their best-in-class prediction tools for selection and optimization of potential therapeutics, where it is essential to recognize and resolve potential problems as early as possible. Computer software for  virtual design  of drug candidate molecules prior to synthesis and testing is ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry and an important time-saver in research. As part of the agreement, both companies will exchange their proprietary technologies; the first phase will incorporate a suite of high-quality predictive models of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) and physicochemical properties from Optibrium's StarDrop  platform as an optional feature within BioSolveIT's SeeSAR  package. This will be followed by the integration of SeeSAR's capabilities to work with 3D structural information into StarDrop's unique environment that guides the design of high quality compounds. Dr. Matt Segall, CEO of Optibrium, commented:  Our customers tell us that they want to understand the relationship between the SAR in their data and the 3D structures of their compounds and protein targets. BioSolveIT's state-of-the-art and scientifically rigorous approach is unparalleled when it comes to visualizing and predicting 3D binding - it was an obvious first choice to work with them. There is great synergy between our platforms' capabilities that needs seamless integration to provide the most value. The strongest binding molecule is of no use if it doesn't achieve sufficient exposure in a patient. Therefore, the discovery of a new drug is a multi-faceted optimization challenge. The adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) behaviour, as well as the toxicity of compounds need to be always at the forefront of drug discovery - alongside target inhibition.  BioSolveIT's Director of Application Science, Dr. Marcus Gastreich, said:  Having an integrated solution for the researcher is like a head-up display: The impact of easy-to-use software accompanying the research process must be non-obstructive but always there: All parameters nicely organized, plus a powerful and minimalistic alerting system are the keys to avoid costly failure.  Dr. Christian Lemmen, CEO of BioSolveIT, said:  Both companies share a passion for intuitive and clean user interfaces - an aspect which is widely neglected in scientific software. Management has realized that users need easily accessible functionality besides scientific value in software. For both, we are proud to have Optibrium as a like-minded partner, their ADME property predictions are highly regarded by the industry. ","Published: October 20, 2015"

The project, which is supported by the Wellcome Trust and Department of Health through the Health Innovation Challenge (HIC) Fund, aims to establish genome sequencing as a clinical tool across a wide range of disorders, including rare diseases and cancers.  This will directly benefit the NHS in establishing new tools to aid clinicians and improve patient outcomes.  The study will also serve as a pilot for other national scale programmes to integrate genomics and healthcare. As part of the agreement, Genomics  bioinformatics tools will be applied to analyse and interpret up to 500 genome sequences focusing on rare diseases and cancer.  Technological developments in gene sequencing have resulted in a significant increase in the amount of genomic data available to researchers. However, making sense of this data is proving a bottleneck in the translation of genomic information into clinical care. Genomics has developed a unique analytical platform for genomic sequence data analysis and interpretation. The platform combines proprietary algorithms and software with the Company s expertise in data mining of large genomic databases to uncover the relationships between genetic variation and human disease.  John Colenutt, CEO at Genomics plc, said:  We are excited to be working with these leading centres in the rapidly-growing area of genomic analysis. The project provides us with the opportunity to apply our data analysis solutions to analyse genomes at scale and in a clinical context and to demonstrate the real value that analyses of large genomic databases can add to research programmes such as this . Assoc. Professor Jenny Taylor, Programme Director and Principal Investigator for the study at the University of Oxford, said:  This collaboration agreement has great potential to bring genome sequencing closer to routine clinical practice.  The depth of expertise and time needed to provide accurate interpretation of whole genome information is a real barrier to its widespread acceptance.  We are excited to explore Genomics  tools for automated and flexible analysis and look forward to working alongside them to drive the development of tools that are fit for widespread deployment.  Professor Keith Channon, Director of the Oxford Biomedical Research Centre and Director of Research at the OUH NHS Foundation Trust said:  Oxford has internationally renowned expertise in using genome sequencing to aid clinical diagnoses and disease gene discovery, following the WGS500 study and investment by the Oxford Biomedical Research Centre and University of Oxford.  This agreement with Genomics plc has the potential to further support Oxford's local clinical genome sequencing programmes as well its contribution to the national 100,000 genomes programme following its designation as an NHS England Genomic Medicine Centre.""

First, the company presented data on its Bis-RNAiTM platform that enables simultaneous knockdown of two distinct disease genes with a single, subcutaneously administered molecular entity. Further, the company presented data on its ReversirTM platform. Reversir molecules enable tailored control of RNAi pharmacology with rapid reversal of target gene silencing effects. The company believes that these new platform technologies greatly expand the universe of opportunities for RNAi therapeutics. ""At Alnylam we strive to pioneer new breakthroughs in RNAi. Today, we're announcing development of two new platform technologies that we believe broaden the opportunities for RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of medicines. With Bis-RNAi, we've developed an approach for the simultaneous knockdown of two distinct target genes with a single, subcutaneously administered molecular entity. We can imagine meaningful applications of Bis-RNAi in many clinical indications, including those in our Cardio-Metabolic and Hepatic Infectious Disease Strategic Therapeutic Areas,"" said Rachel Meyers, Senior Vice President of Research at Alnylam. ""With our Reversir platform, we now have a tool for control of RNAi pharmacology that enables rapid reversal of target gene silencing. We believe that tailored pharmacology is a highly desired attribute for precision medicines. We look forward to the advancement of new pipeline programs based on these platforms as early as next year."" In a poster presentation entitled ""Bis-RNAiTM Conjugates for Simultaneous Silencing of Two Transcripts,"" Alnylam scientists described a novel approach whereby a single molecular entity consisting of two linked siRNAs conjugated to a GalNAc moiety can simultaneously achieve robust silencing of two different mRNA transcripts. Multiple Bis-RNAi designs were evaluated to determine the effects of linker structure and GalNAc ligand placement on in vivo activity. In rodent and non-human primate studies, a Bis-RNAi tool compound targeting transthyretin (TTR) and Factor VII (FVII) achieved similar levels of target gene knockdown as that observed with a ""parent"" mixture consisting of the individual siRNAs at a 1:1 ratio. In addition, the duration of silencing effects for the Bis-RNAi compound was found to be similar to that of the individual siRNAs in the parent mixture. Furthermore, the Bis-RNAi constructs were found to lack immune activity as measured in both an in vitro human whole blood assay and in an in vivo mouse model, with cytokine profiles comparable to the parent mixture and untreated controls. Alnylam believes that there are many potential clinical applications for the Bis-RNAi platform, including in the company's Cardio-Metabolic and Hepatic Infectious Disease STArs, and expects to advance its first Development Candidate from this platform in 2016. In a second presentation entitled ""Reversirs for Rapid and Potent Reversal of siRNA Silencing Activity,"" the company shared key scientific data characterizing the development of its Reversir platform. Reversir molecules are GalNAc-conjugated, single-stranded oligonucleotide constructs that are designed to recognize and bind to the complimentary RISC-bound antisense strand of an siRNA, leading to rapid and complete reversal of RNAi-mediated target gene silencing activity in vivo. Studies were performed in mice using a GalNAc-siRNA targeting Factor IX (FIX) and Reversir constructs designed to specifically reverse the FIX siRNA silencing activity. Specifically, a single subcutaneous dose of the FIX siRNA led to robust FIX knockdown of approximately 80% that was sustained for over 4 weeks. When a single subcutaneous dose of the Reversir molecule was administered on day 8, FIX knockdown was rapidly reversed, with levels returning to baseline within one week. A preliminary rat toxicology study showed that Reversir constructs are generally well tolerated with no significant findings to date, including lack of changes in body weight gain or serum chemistry. Alnylam believes that its Reversir platform can be deployed across existing and future pipeline programs to enable tailored control of RNAi pharmacology for precision medicines, and expects to advance initial Development Candidates from this platform in 2016","Published: October 20, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/charting-genetic-variation-across-the-globe-190408,Charting Genetic Variation Across the Globe An international team of scientists has created the world s largest catalog of human genetic differences in populations around the globe  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Most genetic differences between people called variants are harmless. Some can be beneficial. Others have been linked to diseases and conditions ranging from cognitive problems to susceptibilities to cancer, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Understanding how genomic variants contribute to disease can help researchers develop improved diagnostics and treatments, and even new methods of prevention. The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium was launched in 2008 to learn more about genomic variants in diverse populations. The consortium includes researchers from the United States, United Kingdom, China, Germany, and Canada. NIH, led by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), helped fund and direct the project. Two studies published online on September 30, 2015, in Nature, mark its completion. The researchers examined the genomes of more than 2,500 people from 26 populations across Africa, East and South Asia, Europe, and the Americas. All participants consented to have their data released and used by researchers around the world. In the main study, the investigators identified about 88 million sites in the human genome that vary among people almost 1 per 30 bases of the genome, which has about 3 billion DNA bases. The vast majority of these, about 84.7 million, were differences in a single DNA building block, called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). About 3.6 million were short insertions or deletions of DNA sequences. The rest were larger differences in DNA structure. A typical person s genome, the researchers found, differs from a reference human genome at 4.1 million to 5 million sites. The greatest genomic diversity the researchers found was in African populations. This is consistent with other evidence that humans originated in Africa and migrated to establish other populations around the world. In the companion Nature paper, researchers examined rarer structural variants in the genome defined as variants of at least 50 DNA bases. These can include deletions, insertions, duplications (extra DNA copies), and inversions (DNA sequences changing orientation). They found nearly 69,000 structural variants. Although there are far fewer of these variants compared to SNPs, they contain a disproportionate share of regions that have been associated with specific traits such as disease risk.  The 1000 Genomes Project was an ambitious, historically significant effort that has produced a valuable resource of human genomic variation,  says NHGRI Director Dr. Eric Green.  The latest data and insights add to a growing understanding of the patterns of variation in individuals  genomes, and provide a foundation for gaining greater insights into the genomics of human disease.   The 1000 Genomes Project has laid the foundation for others to answer really interesting questions,  says main study senior author Dr. Adam Auton of the company 23andMe, recently at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.  Everyone now wants to know what these variants tell us about human disease. ","Published: October 20, 2015"

The MinION is a handheld DNA-sequencing device developed by Oxford Nanopore, a spin-out company from the University of Oxford. The smallest high-throughput sequencing system currently available, the device can be plugged into any computer using a USB port, weighs just 90 grams and measures 10 centimetres in length. It works by detecting individual DNA bases that pass through a nanopore   a tiny hole in a membrane. When the DNA bases pass through or near the nanpore, they create a distinctive electrical current, allowing the device to read long DNA sequences in a way that is not possible on most other devices. The sequencer has been made available to thousands of laboratories around the world via the MinION Access Programme, all of them keen to test the abilities of the small device and contribute to its future development. As part of that process, five laboratories involved in an international consortium  from the UK, the US, Canada and The Netherlands, including a team from Oxford s Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics   have carried out a series of experiments to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of the data the device produces.The laboratories carried out two sets of ten experiments, sequencing the genome of a laboratory strain ofE. coli (Escherichia coli K-12). Working to a single, shared protocol, the consortium produced 20 data sets with enough results to be able to quantify the data yield, quality, accuracy and reproducibility that can be expected from the MinION. The findings show that the device provided consistent results between labs which were all of good quality. While the data from the MinION device did contain more errors than larger, more expensive devices   so-called standard short-read technologies   other researchers have shown that they re of high enough quality to infer full-length genomes from scratch, for the E. coli bacterium, Influenza virus, and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast genomes. The researchers of this study point out, though, that there is work still to be done, to improve the reproducible delivery of molecules into the device and the clarity of the software it uses. The results are published online at F1000Research, an open access, open peer-review scientific publishing platform that allows the team to quickly disseminate their findings for use by other researchers.  We ve published the paper in F1000Research before peer review as a baseline for the community, so that everyone can look at the paper and data, go on to do their own analyses share their results and stimulate discussion,  explains Dr David Buck of Oxford University. The rapidity with which the findings are released is important: the data generated in the study actually represents a snapshot of the MinION s performance in April 2015. Since then, innovation on the device has outpaced analysis, with new chips and kits released every 3-6 months.  In a few years time, people who may be several steps removed from basic genomic research, like teachers in a classroom, could be using this device to teach science in new, exciting ways that have never been possible before,  explains Dr Camilla Ip, lead author of the study and Senior Analyst in Microbial Genomics at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics.  I m using the MinION in a project with secondary-school students in Oxford, because this technology will probably be so much a part of daily life in a few years time that they take it for granted.  The next phase of analysis is already underway by the consortium, which is exploring ways to reduce the error rate of the device as well as ensuring that it can work with small samples of DNA.","Published: October 20, 2015"

Charbel Moussa, MD, PhD, who directs Georgetown s Laboratory of Dementia and Parkinsonism, conducted the preclinical research that led to the discovery of nilotinib for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Walking Again To conduct the clinical study, he partnered with Fernando Pagan, MD, a GUMC associate professor of neurology who directs the Movement Disorders Program at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital.  To my knowledge, this study represents the first time a therapy appears to reverse   to a greater or lesser degree depending on stage of disease   cognitive and motor decline in patients with these neurodegenerative disorders,  says Pagan.  But it is critical to conduct larger and more comprehensive studies before determining the drug s true impact.  The investigators report that one individual confined to a wheelchair was able to walk again and that three others who could not speak were able to hold conversations. Pagan notes there was no control group for comparison in the study, and that the drug was not compared with a placebo or other medications used to treat Parkinson s. Safety Test But the researchers report that during use of the medication by the participants, production of dopamine increased in many patients, requiring doses of L-dopa and other dopamine-sparing drugs used to treat Parkinson s to be lowered or stopped. Stopping nilotinib treatment appears to lead to cognitive and motor decline despite reinstating L-dopa therapies. The study s primary objective was to test safety.  The use of nilotinib in doses much smaller than are used to treat cancer, which is up to 800 mg daily, was well tolerated with no serious side effects,  Pagan explains.  The dose used in this study was 150 and 300 mg daily.  The researchers also found that the drug penetrates the blood-brain barrier in amounts greater than dopamine drugs. The observed efficacy in cognition, motor skills and non-motor function improvement (such as constipation) for many patients was the most dramatic result, Pagan notes.  Study participants with earlier stage disease responded best, as did those diagnosed with Lewy body dementia, often described as a combination of Parkinson s and Alzheimer s diseases,  he says.   Life-Changing Improvement Alan Hoffman, a professor emeritus of social science education at Georgia State University, was diagnosed with Parkinson s disease in 1997. He says he participated in several clinical trials with no benefit until he enrolled in Pagan s study.  Before the nilotinib, I did almost nothing around the house,  he says.  Now, I empty the garbage, unload the dishwasher, load the washer and the dryer, set the table, even take responsibility for grilling.  In the three weeks prior to enrolling in the study, Hoffman says he fell eight times, but he only fell once during six months on the study. His speech has improved, as has his thinking.    My wife says it s life-changing for her and for my children and grandchildren,  Hoffman says.  To say that nilotinib has made a change in our lives is a huge understatement.  Translational Success Moussa, an inventor on a Georgetown University patent application for nilotinib and other similar drugs for neurodegenerative diseases, notes that the research went to clinical trials only two years after his initial discovery.  He first set out to find approved cancer drugs that could penetrate the blood-brain barrier and turn on the  garbage disposal machinery  inside neurons to clear toxic intracellular proteins and prevent their accumulation within, or secretion outside of, brain cells.  A lot of institutions talk about expediting the translation of research from the lab to the bedside, but it doesn't happen quickly very often,  Moussa says.  This is a solid example of how that is possible and why it is so important.  Patients Continue Treatment Hoffman and other patients in the clinical trial can continue taking nilotinib as part of an expanded access study. Georgetown researchers are now planning larger clinical trials with nilotinib for patients with Parkinson s and other similar diseases including Alzheimer s disease, likely to begin in 2016. The phase I study received philanthropic funding and was supported by the Georgetown-Howard Universities Center for Clinical and Translational Science.","Published: October 20, 2015"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/evidence-of-how-incurable-cancer-develops-193859,Evidence of How Incurable Cancer Develops Researchers in the West Midlands have made a breakthrough in explaining how an incurable type of blood cancer develops from an often symptomless prior blood disorder  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The findings could lead to more effective treatments and ways to identify those most at risk of developing the cancer. All patients diagnosed with myeloma, a cancer of the blood-producing bone marrow, first develop a relatively benign condition called  monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance  or  MGUS . MGUS is fairly common in the older population and only progresses to cancer in approximately one in 100 cases. However, currently there is no way of accurately predicting which patients with MGUS are likely to go on to get myeloma. Myeloma is diagnosed in around 4,000 people each year in the UK. It specifically affects antibody-producing white blood cells found in the bone marrow, called plasma cells. The researcher team from the University of Birmingham, New Cross and Heartlands Hospitals compared the cellular chemistry of bone marrow and blood samples taken from patients with myeloma, patients with MGUS and healthy volunteers. Surprisingly, the researchers found that the metabolic activity of the bone marrow of patients with MGUS was significantly different to plasma from healthy volunteers, but there were very few differences at all between the MGUS and myeloma samples. The research was funded by the blood cancer charity Bloodwise, which changed its name from Leukaemia & Lymphoma in September. Metabolism is the chemical process through which cells create energy and the substances needed to grow and perform cell functions. Cancer cells promote metabolic changes to kick start and drive their rapid growth. The findings suggest that the biggest metabolic changes occur with the development of the symptomless condition MGUS and not with the later progression to myeloma. Dr Daniel Tennant, who led the research at the University of Birmingham, said,  Our findings show that very few changes are required for a MGUS patient to progress to myeloma as we now know virtually all patients with myeloma evolve from MGUS. A drug that interferes with these specific initial metabolic changes could make a very effective treatment for myeloma, so this is a very exciting discovery.  The research team found over 200 products of metabolism differed between the healthy volunteers and patients with MGUS or myeloma, compared to just 26 differences between MGUS patients and myeloma patients. The researchers believe that these small changes could drive the key shifts in the bone marrow required to support myeloma growth. Dr Matt Kaiser, Head of Research at Bloodwise, said,  Myeloma is a devastating cancer that can cause debilitating and painful bone damage and, although we have become better at treating it and extending the lives of myeloma patients, it is ultimately almost always fatal. This research provides the basis for developing new and more targeted treatments and minimally invasive ways of identifying those MGUS patients at risk of progressing to myeloma. If we can find ways to block the progression of MGUS, we hope to prevent many cases of myeloma in the future. ","Published: October 20, 2015"

It had previously been thought to be impossible to characterize these changes, in part because the transitions are so incredibly small and fleeting. The changes relate to how proteins convert from one observable shape to another   and they happen in less than one trillionth of a second, in molecules that are less than one millionth of an inch in size. It had been known that these changes must happen and they have been simulated by computers, but prior to this no one had ever observed how they happen. Now they have, in part by recognizing the value of certain data collected by many researchers over the last two decades. Actual evidence of these transitions was hiding in plain sight all this time,  said Andrew Brereton, an OSU doctoral student and lead author on this study.  We just didn t know what to look for, and didn t understand how significant it was.  All proteins start as linear chains of building blocks and then quickly fold to their proper shape, going through many high-energy transitions along the way. Proper folding is essential to the biological function of proteins, and when it doesn t happen correctly, protein folding diseases can be one result   such as Alzheimer s disease, Lou Gehrig s disease, amyloidosis and others. Proteins themselves are a critical component of life, the workhorses of biology. They are comparatively large, specialty molecules that can do everything from perceiving light to changing shape and making muscles function. Even the process of thinking involves proteins at the end of one neuron passing a message to different proteins on the next neuron. A powerful tool called X-ray crystallography has been able to capture images of proteins in their more stable shapes, but what was unknown is exactly how they got from one stable form to another. The changes in shape that are needed for those transitions are fleeting and involve distortions in the molecules that are extreme and difficult to predict. What the OSU researchers discovered, however, is that the stable shapes adopted by a few proteins actually contained some parts that were trapped in the act of changing shape, conceptually similar to finding mosquitos trapped in amber.  We discovered that some proteins were holding single building blocks in shapes that were supposed to be impossible to find in a stable form,  said Andrew Karplus, the corresponding author on the study and a distinguished professor of biochemistry and biophysics in the OSU College of Science.  Apparently about one building block out of every 6,000 gets trapped in a highly unlikely shape that is like a single frame in a movie,  Karplus said.  The set of these trapped residues taken together have basically allowed us to make a movie that shows how these special protein shape changes occur. And what this movie shows has real differences from what the computer simulations had predicted.  As with most fundamental discoveries, the researchers said, the full value of the findings may take years or decades to play out. What is clear is that proteins are key to some of the most fundamental processes of life, and this new information has revealed the first direct views of specific details of one aspect of protein folding in a way that had not been considered possible.  In the 1870s an English photographer named Eadweard Muybridge made some famous photographs that settled a debate which had been going on for decades, about whether horses as they run actually lift all four feet off the ground at the same time,  Karplus said.  His novel series of stop-action photos proved that they did, and opened up a whole new understanding of animal locomotion,  he said.  In a similar way, our results change the way researchers can now look at one of the ways proteins change shape, and that s a pretty fundamental part of life. ","Published: October 20, 2015"

As a part of the agreement, Asterias will be opening a UK subsidiary and employing staff based in the UK. The Cell Therapy Catapult will streamline and scale manufacturing processes for Asterias  AST-VAC2 and its forthcoming phase II clinical trial targeting lung cancer. This will provide support that will enable advanced clinical trials and eventual commercialization of the immunotherapy product. AST-VAC2 is an allogeneic (non-patient specific) cancer vaccine designed to stimulate patient immune responses to telomerase, which is expressed in over 95% of human cancers but is rarely expressed in normal adult cells. AST-VAC2 is currently being developed towards a Phase I/II trial in lung cancer in collaboration with Cancer Research UK. Asterias selected the Cell Therapy Catapult because of its depth of expertise in cell therapy and the head start the Cell Therapy Catapult had on the challenge due to its own internal Cell Plasticity Platform Project, which is developing large scale manufacturing processes for pluripotent cells. Asterias believes the Cell Therapy Catapult is an important driver in making the UK an environment that facilitates and supports the development of regenerative medicine products. As part of the agreement, Asterias plans a UK subsidiary. The subsidiary will provide Asterias with the ability to effectively collaborate with the Cell Therapy Catapult and other major partners in the UK. Asterias also will use the UK operation to play a critical role in contributing to the development of the AST-VAC2 platform and maximizing its value.  International partnerships are critical for the further development of the UK cell and gene therapy industry.

This is no mean feat: The human genome is about 6.5 feet long, and the average cell nucleus is only 6 to10 micrometers (one-millionth of a meter) in diameter.  How this happens and the genome's three-dimensional shape within the nucleus are unknown. Nor is it known how the shape changes over time   the fourth dimension   as a cell develops, grows and goes about its specialized functions. There s a tendency to talk about the genome as a linear sequence and to forget about the fact that it s folded,  said Dr. Jay Shendure, University of Washington associate professor of genome sciences and investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.    To understand how the different parts of the genome talk to each other to control gene expression, we need to understand how the different elements are arranged in relation to each other in three-dimensional space.  To puzzle out this information and its effect on cell function in health and disease, UW researchers will join peers at five other academic institutions to create the Nuclear Organization and Function Interdisciplinary Consortium.  Underwriting the consortium is the National Institutes of Health s 4D Nucleome program. The UW was awarded $12 million over five years to conduct research in its new Center for Nuclear Organization and Function. Shendure and William Stafford Noble, a professor of genome sciences and computer science, will co-lead. UW researchers will first develop tools to work out the three- and four-dimensional architecture of the nucleome and to create computer models that predict changes in the architecture as cells grow, divide and differentiate into different types.  The results of this work will then be tested in mouse and human cell lines and, if confirmed, be used to understand how changes in nuclear architecture affect development of normal and abnormal heart muscle.  All tools and data developed by the project will be shared with researchers in and outside of the 4D Nucleome network of researchers and with the public.","Published: October 20, 2015"

The study was undertaken by a team led by Professor Kypros Nicolaides with Dr Liona Poon as the lead author at the Harris Birthright Research Centre for Fetal Medicine, King s College Hospital, London, and was published in the Journal of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The blinded validation study, assessed the potential performance of the IONA  test in using cell-free DNA analysis of 242 maternal blood samples to screen for Down s syndrome (Trisomy 21), Edwards  syndrome (Trisomy 18) and Patau s syndrome (Trisomy 13). Samples were obtained from pregnant women at 11 to 13 weeks gestation before choroinic villus sampling. The maternal plasma samples were then analyzed in Premaitha s laboratories using the IONA  test. The test results were analyzed using the IONA  Software, Premaitha s bespoke bioinformatics package available for all clinical laboratory customers. The IONA  test measures the relative amount of chromosomes 21, 18 and 13 in the maternal plasma sample to calculate a likelihood ratio to predict the presence of a trisomy. This data is coupled with the background risk associated with maternal age to determine an adjusted probability of the fetus having a trisomy of chromosome 21, 18 or 13. Of the 242 samples; 35 were trisomy 21, 4 were trisomy 18, and 2 were trisomy 13. The IONA  test detected 100% of all trisomies with a false positive rate of 0%. Prof Kypros Nicolaides commented on the study  I am very impressed by the accuracy of the IONA  test  and Dr Liona Poon, both at the Harris Birthright Research Centre for Fetal Medicine, Division of Women's Health, King's College London said:  I hope the new technology used in the IONA  test will allow easy implementation of cfDNA testing in the screening for major fetal aneuploidies.  Dr William Denman, Chief Medical Officer at Premaitha said:  These results confirm what our customers have already reported; that the IONA  test is a highly accurate, robust and simple screen for Down s syndrome and other serious genetic conditions. It is a great endorsement of the test that Professor Nicolaides and his team have chosen to verify it. We believe this should encourage broader and appropriate uptake of NIPT, benefiting pregnant women and their families through the increased accuracy, especially the reduction in false positive results that the IONA  test provides.  NIPT is more sensitive and specific than the currently available combined test. NIPT provides pregnant women and their families a more accurate and reliable screening result, reducing the incidence of unnecessary and stressful invasive procedures like amniocentesis, and the associated risk of miscarriage.","Published: October 20, 2015"

Cunningham. Dr. Cunningham was lead investigator of the study which was carried out at the Orthopaedic Spinal Research Institute, University of Maryland. The objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of KUR-115 in various concentrations versus autograft and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) controls for lumbar interbody spinal arthrodesis. The study achieved its primary objective which was the demonstration of a fusion identified at 4 and 10 months in 8/8 levels treated with the optimal concentration of KUR-115 (0.4 mg/mL) as well as the autograft and BMP-2 controls; all following a direct lateral surgical approach, complete diskectomy and endplate decortication at L2-L3 and L4-L5. Flexion-extension and lateral bending exhibited reduced segmental motion for all treatment groups at 4 months versus the non-operative intact spine (p<0.05). By 12 months, both axial rotation and flexion-extension motion were significantly lower than the intact spine (p<0.05). Histopathology indicated no evidence of foreign body/inflammatory reaction or significant pathological changes in any specimens. There were also no significant intra-or peri-operative complications in any cases. Dr. Bryan W. Cunningham commented:  These positive pre-clinical results suggest that KUR-115 could be a highly effective alternative to autograft in lumbar interbody spinal arthrodesis. This study will serve as a basic scientific basis for future clinical investigations into the use and efficacy of parathyroid hormone based approaches for the treatment of a number of spinal indications.  Didier Cowling, Chief Executive Officer, said: ""These positive results further highlight the significant potential of Kuros  technology platform in a broad range of spinal and orthopaedic indications. We look forward to progressing KUR-115 into clinical development and adding to the positive data generated in large Phase IIb studies by KUR-111 and KUR-113.  The pre-clinical study was performed on 32 skeletally mature sheep and randomized into post-operative time periods of 4 months (n=20) and 10 months (n=12).

The findings, published in JAMA Neurology, identify structural damage between the thalamus and primary motor cortex as the obstacle between covert awareness and intentional movement. The team of researchers hope that their study, the first to understand the phenomenon, will pave the way for the development of restorative therapies for thousands of patients. Dr. Davinia Fern ndez-Espejo, from the University of Birmingham, explained, ""A number of patients who appear to be in a vegetative state are actually aware of themselves and their surroundings, able to comprehend the world around them, create memories and imagine events as with any other person."" ""However, before we take the crucial step of developing targeted therapies to help these patients, we needed to identify the reason for the dissociation between their retained awareness and their inability to respond with intentional movement."" ""In highlighting damage to the pathways that physically connect the thalamus, one of the hubs of consciousness if you will, and the motor cortex, which drives our voluntary muscular activity, as the reason behind the dissociation we have provided an important explanation"". A patient who produced repeated evidence of covert awareness across multiple examinations, despite being in a vegetative state for over 12 years, was observed in a case study at the imaging centre at the Brain and Mind Institute, at Western University, in London, Canada. A fellow patient with similar clinical variables, but capable of intentional movement, and 15 healthy control volunteers were also monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and fiber tractography. Participants were asked to respond to commands, for example, asking them to imagine moving their hand in response to the keyword ""move"", while their brain activity was measured. Additionally, the researchers assessed the integrity of the structural pathways that were revealed as essential for successful motor execution (those connecting the thalamus with the motor cortex). Dr. Fern ndez-Espejo added, ""The ultimate aim is to use this information in targeted therapies that can drastically improve the quality of life of patients. For example, with the advances being made in assistive technology, if we can help a patient to regain even limited movement in one finger it opens up so many possibilities for communication and control of their environment.""

Scientists have long known the essential genes in microorganisms, such as yeast, whose genomes are smaller and more easily manipulated. Most common yeast strains, for example, are haploid, meaning that genes exist in single copies, making it fairly simple for researchers to eliminate or  knock out  individual genes and assess the impact on the organism. However, owing to their greater complexity, diploid mammalian genomes, including the human genome, have been resistant to such knockout techniques including RNA interference, which is hampered by off-target effects and incomplete gene silencing. Now, however, through use of the breakthrough CRISPR (for clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats) genome editing system, researchers in the labs of Whitehead Member David Sabatini and Broad Institute Director Eric Lander have been able to generate a genome-wide library of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to screen for and identify the genes required for cellular viability. The sgRNA library targeted slightly more than 18,000 genes, of which approximately 10% proved to be essential.   This is the first report of human cell-essential genes,  says Tim Wang, a graduate student in the Sabatini and Lander labs and first author of the paper.  This answers a question people have been asking for quite a long time.  As might have been expected, Wang says that many of the essential genes are involved in fundamental biological processes, including DNA replication, RNA transcription, and translation of messenger RNA. But, as Wang also notes, approximately 300 of these essential genes are of a class not previously characterized, are largely located in the cellular compartment known as the nucleolus, and are associated with RNA processing. Wang says the precise function of these genes is the subject of future investigation. To validate the results of the CRISPR screens, the group took the added step of screening for essential genes in a unique line of haploid human cells. Using an approach known as gene-trap mutagenesis (a method pioneered in part by former Whitehead Fellow Thijn Brummelkamp) in the haploid cells and comparing it to the CRISPR results, the researchers found significant, consistent overlap in the gene sets found to be essential. In a final step, the group tested their approaches in cell lines derived from two cancers, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Burkitt s lymphoma, both of which have been extensively studied. The novel method not only identified the essentiality of the known genes in the case of CML, it hit on the BCR and ABL1 genes, whose translocation is the target of the successful drug Gleevec but also highlighted additional genes that may be therapeutic targets in these cancers.  The ability to zero in on the essential genes in the highly complex human system will give us new insight into how diseases, such as cancer, continue to resist efforts to defeat them,  Lander says. Wang, Lander, and Sabatini are enthusiastic about the potential applications of their work, as it should accelerate the identification of cancer drug targets while enhancing our understanding of the evolution of drug resistance, a major contributor to therapeutic failure. The researchers attribute this vast potential to the rigor that CRISPR brings to human genetics.  This is really the first time we can reliably, accurately, and systematically study genetics in mammalian cells,  Sabatini says.  It s remarkable how well it s working.

Now, scientists from UCLA and UC Berkeley have produced images of telomerase in much higher resolution than ever before, giving them major new insights about the enzyme. Their findings could ultimately lead to new directions for treating cancer and preventing premature aging.  Many details we could only guess at before, we can now see unambiguously, and we now have an understanding of where the different components of telomerase interact,  said Juli Feigon, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry in the UCLA College and a senior author of the study.  If telomerase were a cat, before we could see its general outline and the location of the limbs, but now we can see the eyes, the whiskers, the tail and the toes. The research brought together experts in structural biology, biochemistry and biophysics, and a wide range of cutting-edge research techniques. Telomerase s primary job is to maintain the DNA in telomeres, the structures at the ends of our chromosomes that act like the plastic tips at the ends of shoelaces. When telomerase isn t active, each time our cells divide, the telomeres get shorter. When that happens, the telomeres eventually become so short that the cells stop dividing or die. On the other hand, cells with abnormally active telomerase can constantly rebuild their protective chromosomal caps and become immortal. Making cells immortal might sound like a promising prospect, but it actually is harmful because DNA errors accumulate over time, which damages cells, said Feigon, who also is a researcher at UCLA s Molecular Biology Institute and an associate member of the UCLA Department of Energy Institute of Genomics and Proteomics. Telomerase is particularly active in cancer cells, which helps make them immortal and enables cancer to grow and spread. Scientists believe that controlling the length of telomeres in cancer cells could be a way to prevent them from multiplying.  When Feigon began her research on telomerase slightly more than a decade ago, she merely wanted to learn how telomerase works; fighting cancer and slowing the aging process were not even in the back of her mind.  Our research may make those things achievable, even though they were not our goals,  she said.  You never know where basic research will go. When telomerase and telomeres were discovered, no one had any idea what the impact of that research would be. The question was,  How are the ends of our chromosomes maintained?  We knew there had to be some activity in the cell that does that.  Earlier research led by UC San Francisco professor Elizabeth Blackburn revealed that telomerase was responsible for this activity, but the study didn t connect telomerase to cancer and it provided little information about its structural biology. The research was conducted using tiny, single-celled microorganisms called Tetrahymena thermophila that are commonly found in freshwater ponds. Blackburn won a Nobel Prize in 2009 for the finding. Since then, Feigon and her colleagues have been filling in pieces of the telomerase puzzle, also using Tetrahymena. Their latest study found that the microorganism s telomerase is more analogous to human telomerase than previously thought.  This is the first time that a whole telomerase directly isolated from its natural workplace has been visualized at a sub-nanometer resolution and all components are identified in the structure,  said Jiansen Jiang, the study s co-lead author and a UCLA postdoctoral scholar. (A nanometer is equivalent to one billionth of a meter.) Among the new insights the team reported:   Scientists had thought telomerase contains eight sub-units: seven proteins and an RNA. But Feigon and her colleagues discovered two additional proteins, Teb2 and Teb3, that increase telomerase s activity.  Knowing we were the first people in the world who knew about these new proteins was amazing,  she said.  Days like that are what scientific discovery is all about, and it s exhilarating.    Feigon s research team knew that the RNA strand interacts with the proteins, but not exactly where it interacted. The new study found that within the enzyme s  catalytic core,  which is formed by the RNA and its partner proteins TERT and p65, the RNA forms a ring around the donut-shaped TERT protein.   Scientists previously knew that telomerase contains three proteins, p75, p45 and p19, but their structures and functions were poorly understood. The new research identified the proteins  structures and revealed that they are similar to proteins found at human telomeres.    The researchers showed that a key protein called p50 interacts with several components of telomerase, including TERT, Teb1 and p75, and this network of interactions has important implications for telomerase s function. Feigon knew that the Tetrahymena enzyme s catalytic core, where the majority of the telomerase activity occurs, was a close analogue to the catalytic core in the human enzyme, but she did not previously know whether the other proteins had human counterparts.  It turns out that nearly all, if not all, of the telomerase proteins in Tetrahymena have similar proteins in humans,  Feigon said.  Now we can use our model system to learn more about how telomerase interacts at the telomeres.  Feigon and her colleagues are working to fill in even more details of the telomerase puzzle. Their research could lead to the development of pharmaceuticals that target specific sub-units of telomerase and disrupt interactions between proteins.  There is so much potential for treating disease if we understand deeply how telomerase works,  Feigon said. Among the technologies the researchers used to produce the groundbreaking images were UCLA s cryoelectron microscopes, which are housed in the laboratory of Z. Hong Zhou, director of the Electron Imaging Center for Nanomachines at the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA and a co-author of the paper. The researchers also used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry and biochemical methods.","Published: October 19, 2015"

The results provide a possible strategy for treating the two diseases.  This research shines a spotlight on the role of nuclear transport in the health of neurons,  said Amelie Gubitz, Ph.D., program director at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).  The results provide new insights into how this mutation derails an essential process in neurons and opens new avenues for therapy development. Both ALS and FTD are caused by the death of specific neurons. In ALS, this leads to movement difficulties and eventually paralysis, while in FTD, patients experience problems with language and decision making. Past research has connected a specific mutation in the C9orf72 gene to 40 percent of inherited ALS cases and 25 percent of inherited FTD cases, as well as nearly 10 percent of non-inherited cases of each disorder. The recent experiments, conducted in yeast, fruit flies, and neurons from patients, found that the mutation prevents proteins and genetic material called RNA from moving between the nucleus and the cytoplasm that surrounds it.  At the end of the day, this culminates in a defect in the flow of genetic information, which leads to problems expressing genes in the right place at the right time,  said J. Paul Taylor, M.D., Ph.D., a researcher at St. Jude s Children s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, and the senior author of one of the papers. DNA is made up of building blocks called nucleotides. In the mutated C9orf72 gene, a sequence of six nucleotides is repeated many times more than are typical. These repetitive stretches of DNA produce RNA molecules that can interfere with proteins in the cell. The RNA also generates toxic proteins called dipeptide repeat proteins. However, until now, it was unknown what specific cellular systems were impaired by these two products of the mutation. All three groups of scientists found evidence that the mutation impairs nuclear transport in neurons grown from patients  skin cells. Dr. Taylor s team showed that these neurons have much more RNA in the nucleus compared to those created from healthy control cells, implying that the mutation prevents RNA from leaving the nucleus. The other two groups discovered that the patient-derived neurons had trouble bringing certain proteins into the nucleus as well. Researchers led by Jeffrey Rothstein, M.D., Ph.D., from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore focused on how the abnormal RNA produced by the C9orf72 mutation affects a protein called RanGAP, which is essential for transporting materials into the nucleus. Building on previous work, the group confirmed that the RNA strands bind to RanGAP in brain tissue from patients with the mutation and stop the protein from performing its function. The team then treated those cells with compounds that prevented this interference and found that this eliminated the transport defect, allowing proteins to get inside the nucleus. Similarly, increasing production of RanGAP in fruit flies reduced neuronal deterioration and motor problems caused by the mutation.  This research defines the tipping point for how both ALS and FTD start, which is the interruption of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport,  Dr. Rothstein said.  By examining a combination of fly models, living human brain cells, and real human tissue from autopsies, these studies comprehensively teach us what starts the disease.  In addition to their work with the lab-grown neurons, Dr. Taylor s team explored the mutation s effects by inserting eight, 28, or 58 copies of the repetitive DNA sequence into fruit fly neurons. They found that additional copies caused more harm to the cells. The group then performed a genetic  screen  in which they systematically mutated other fly genes to find ones that increased or decreased this damage. Many of the genes they found code for nuclear transport proteins, which regulate the movement of molecules in and out of the nucleus.  We were really amazed to find 18 genes that relate to nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, so we knew that we were onto something that was a very strong hit,  Dr. Taylor said. Meanwhile, a third team of researchers led by Stanford University s Aaron Gitler, Ph.D., performed similar screens in yeast cells containing the toxic dipeptide repeat proteins produced by the C9orf72 mutation. As in Dr. Taylor s study, these experiments suggested that genes involved in nuclear transport influence how harmful the dipeptide repeat proteins are to the cells.  It s encouraging that multiple groups, using independent approaches, have all converged on the same genes and pathways,  Dr. Gitler said. Taken together, the three studies suggest that therapies designed to increase nucleocytoplasmic transport may be effective for treating some forms of ALS and FTD.","Published: October 19, 2015"

The genome was taken from the skull of a man buried face-down 4,500 years ago in a cave called Mota in the highlands of Ethiopia   a cave cool and dry enough to preserve his DNA for thousands of years. Previously, ancient genome analysis has been limited to samples from northern and arctic regions. The latest study is the first time an ancient human genome has been recovered and sequenced from Africa, the source of all human genetic diversity. The ancient genome predates a mysterious migratory event which occurred roughly 3,000 years ago, known as the  Eurasian backflow , when people from regions of Western Eurasia such as the Near East and Anatolia suddenly flooded back into the Horn of Africa. The genome enabled researchers to run a millennia-spanning genetic comparison and determine that these Western Eurasians were closely related to the Early Neolithic farmers who had brought agriculture to Europe 4,000 years earlier. By comparing the ancient genome to DNA from modern Africans, the team have been able to show that not only do East African populations today have as much as 25% Eurasian ancestry from this event, but that African populations in all corners of the continent   from the far West to the South   have at least 5% of their genome traceable to the Eurasian migration.       Researchers describe the findings as evidence that the  backflow  event was of far greater size and influence than previously thought. The massive wave of migration was perhaps equivalent to over a quarter of the then population of the Horn of Africa, which hit the area and then dispersed genetically across the whole continent.  Roughly speaking, the wave of West Eurasian migration back into the Horn of Africa could have been as much as 30% of the population that already lived there   and that, to me, is mind-blowing. The question is: what got them moving all of a sudden?  said Dr Andrea Manica, senior author of the study from the University of Cambridge s Department of Zoology.     Previous work on ancient genetics in Africa had involved trying to work back through the genomes of current populations, attempting to eliminate modern influences.  With an ancient genome, we have a direct window into the distant past. One genome from one individual can provide a picture of an entire population,  said Manica.   The cause of the West Eurasian migration back into Africa is currently a mystery, with no obvious climatic reasons. Archaeological evidence does, however, show the migration coincided with the arrival of Near Eastern crops into East Africa such as wheat and barley, suggesting the migrants helped develop new forms of agriculture in the region.       The researchers say it s clear that the Eurasian migrants were direct descendants of, or a very close population to, the Neolithic farmers that had had brought agriculture from the Near East into West Eurasia around 7,000 years ago, and then migrated into the Horn of Africa some 4,000 years later.  It s quite remarkable that genetically-speaking this is the same population that left the Near East several millennia previously,  said Eppie Jones, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin who led the laboratory work to sequence the genome.  While the genetic make-up of the Near East has changed completely over the last few thousand years, the closest modern equivalents to these Neolithic migrants are Sardinians, probably because Sardinia is an isolated island, says Jones.  The famers found their way to Sardinia and created a bit of a time capsule. Sardinian ancestry is closest to the ancient Near East.   Genomes from this migration seeped right across the continent, way beyond East Africa, from the Yoruba on the western coast to the Mbuti in the heart of the Congo   who show as much as 7% and 6% of their genomes respectively to be West Eurasian,  said Marcos Gallego Llorente, first author of the study, also from Cambridge s Zoology Department.  Africa is a total melting pot. We know that the last 3,000 years saw a complete scrambling of population genetics in Africa. So being able to get a snapshot from before these migration events occurred is a big step,  Gallego Llorente said. The ancient Mota genome allows researchers to jump to before another major African migration: the Bantu expansion, when speakers of an early Bantu language flowed out of West Africa and into central and southern areas around 3,000 years ago. Manica says the Bantu expansion may well have helped carry the Eurasian genomes to the continent s furthest corners. The researchers also identified genetic adaptations for living at altitude, and a lack of genes for lactose tolerance   all genetic traits shared by the current populations of the Ethiopian highlands. In fact, the researchers found that modern inhabitants of the area highlands are direct descendants of the Mota man. Finding high-quality ancient DNA involves a lot of luck, says Dr Ron Pinhasi, co-senior author from University College Dublin.  It s hard to get your hands on remains that have been suitably preserved. The denser the bone, the more likely you are to find DNA that s been protected from degradation, so teeth are often used, but we found an even better bone   the petrous.  The petrous bone is a thick part of the temporal bone at the base of the skull, just behind the ear.    The sequencing of ancient genomes is still so new, and it s changing the way we reconstruct human origins,  added Manica.  These new techniques will keep evolving, enabling us to gain an ever-clearer understanding of who our earliest ancestors were. ","Published: October 19, 2015"

To assure that high-quality iPSCs are available for research and clinical use, the collaborators are developing rigorous new genomics-based methods to analyze the cells. iPSCs are made by taking a mature cell, such as a skin cell, and dialing back its developmental programming so it becomes a stem cell, capable of differentiating into virtually any cell type in the body.  Quality control is our major goal,  said Professor Jeanne Loring of TSRI.  We must ensure that the neurons and other cells derived from iPSCs for clinical use and drug discovery are the ideal cell type for the application. As an analogy, imagine the development of a classical drug treatment. The pills that are provided to patients must contain the right amount of the right drug. Our work applies the same quality control principles to stem cells.  Taking Quality Control to the Next Level The project is jointly funded by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) and the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Loring will receive $1.8 million for the project in California, and the BMBF will provide matching funds for the German part of the project, for which Franz-Josef M ller (Cluster of Excellence  Inflammation at Interfaces ) is coordinator. The grant will help the team advance a biotechnological tool called  PluriTest,  developed and introduced in 2011 by Loring and M ller, previously at TSRI and now studying neuropsychiatric disorders and inflammation at the ZIP in Germany. The new software will be called ""PluriTest2.""  We will take the next technological step, next generation sequencing, in order to close gaps in stem cell quality control,  said M ller.  In contrast to previous microarray-based technology, we can now see every gene that is expressed in the cell in much more detail. This allows us to draw even more extensive and reliable conclusions on pluripotency, validity of our in vitromodels and patient safety.  Loring noted the international collaboration is very promising.  The dynamics of international experts working together in a collaborative spirit is inspiring,  she said.  In this case, since our German partners at the Fraunhofer IME are leading experts in the area of early-stage drug discovery, I am especially hopeful that the work will lead to significant scientific insights and progress in new approaches to drug development.  While patient safety and acceleration of new therapies are strong arguments for optimizing biotechnological tools, researcher Ole Pless, of the IME-ScreeningPort also noted the project offers the pharmaceutical sector huge potential savings.  Until now, a lot of money has been burned by high failure rates in drug development,  Pless said.  So we urgently need to improve pre-clinical disease and toxicity models to lower those rates. We need to see earlier on in the process whether we are heading in the right direction with a possible therapeutic agent or not. And we expect that with iPS cells we could considerably enhance the chance of success. ","Published: October 19, 2015"

The work was carried out as part of the UK10K project, a British research program funded by the Wellcome Trust which has sequenced the genes of several thousand volunteers. The results identified those genes in which variants more commonly occurred in either the schizophrenic or the obese subjects. Lead researcher, Professor David Curtis, said:  Schizophrenia and obesity represent huge public health problems. Both conditions have a substantial genetic contribution which is at present poorly understood. This study illustrates the way that genetic sequencing technology can help us to make progress in this area."" As expected, two variants in the MC4R gene which were previously known to protect against developing obesity were seldom seen in the obese subjects. However rare variants in genes called CRHR1 and SNORD115 were seen more frequently in obese subjects, suggesting that if these genes do not work normally then this increases the risk of obesity. Intriguingly, SNORD115 lies within a region of chromosome 15 which is deleted in Prader-Willi syndrome, a condition which causes sufferers to have extreme cravings for food. Thus these results suggest that SNORD115 might be responsible for this distressing symptom. Both SNORD115 and CRHR1, which interact with each other, are known to be involved in the body s metabolic functions but this is the first time they have been implicated in risk of obesity. Schizophrenic subjects had more frequent variants in NLGN2, a gene which is involved in ensuring that the synapses, the junctions between neurons in the brain, function correctly. This provides further support for the theory that schizophrenia may in part be due to problems with synaptic function. A number of other genes of interest were identified and these will also be the subject of further research. ""Genetic research is entering an exciting period,"" added Professor Curtis. ""We are now able to study directly the changes in DNA sequence which alter the code of specific genes, rather than simply studying genetic markers which lie close to genes. This will allow us to understand exactly how changes in this sequence can change the function of molecules in the cell and how this can go on to influence the risk of developing serious diseases. In time this will lead to improved methods of prevention and treatment and we will be able to give patients a better understanding of the causes of their conditions. ""Genetic sequencing identifies millions of tiny variants in the genetic code between one person and another. Because there are so many variants, it can be difficult to be sure which ones contribute to disease risk. However, as we obtain sequence data for more and more people, we will gradually develop a fuller understanding of the consequences of these variants. For example, we can study the effects of specific DNA variants in cells cultured in the lab and using model systems like this we can test new drugs to try to correct the problems caused."" Dr Richard Durbin at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said:  The UK10K collaborative research project has involved researchers across Britain who sequenced all the genes in nearly ten thousand British people with a variety of medical conditions. We are delighted that it has enabled a wide range of genetics studies, including these important findings on the genetics of schizophrenia and obesity.""","Published: October 19, 2015"

The major goal of the agreement is to develop a rape kit test method based on PBI's PCT Platform, and to have it commercially available within the next 18 months. With a current estimated backlog of 400,000 untested rape kits in the U.S., plus an estimated 180,000 new sexual assault cases annually, there is a significant and immediate need for better test methods to address this national issue.  Scientists at PBI and FIU believe that a test method focused on the key intrinsic advantages of PCT can result in an improved rape kit test method with great potential to help reduce this backlog. The collection of biological samples on cotton swabs for forensic analysis has been standard practice for many years.  Unfortunately, the recovery of high quality DNA from these swabs is very difficult, as the biological sample is often trapped in the swab's cotton fibers, resulting in a loss of precious evidence. This is a particular problem with rape kits in which the male suspect's DNA must be isolated from a complex mixture of male and female cells. Many attempts have been made to develop new methods to improve the efficiency and quality of recovery of this evidence, which currently requires an extensive isolation procedure. A recent publication by Drs. McCord and Nori of FIU discussed a novel, PCT-based technique that showed decreased processing times and higher yields while using inexpensive reagents on a semi-automated platform. Dr. Bruce McCord, Associate Director of FIU's International Forensic Research Institute (""IFRI""), said: ""We are excited by this opportunity to expand the range of applications of PCT in forensic analysis, specifically to assist in the development of a rapid and direct alternative to current methods for the analysis of rape kits.  In this project, we will further improve and validate this new PCT-based method.  We believe this method will be able to isolate male and female DNA, even in situations where trace amounts of male DNA remain. We also believe that this PCT-based method could be significantly faster and provide improved sample recovery when compared to current methods. These advantages should be well received by the forensic community."" ","Published: October 19, 2015"

This discovery will allow the design of drugs that can be used to overcome recover from damage caused by interferon, wherein the drug acts by inhibiting the binding between C protein and STAT1. Researchers are now trying to screen low molecular weight compounds for developing new anti-viral drugs. SeV, a prototype of the paramyxovirus, causes respiratory diseases in rodents. The paramyxovirus family includes virus that cause important diseases in humans and animals, such as measles virus, mumps virus, human parainfluenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, canine distemper virus, Newcastle disease virus, and Nipah virus.SeV has unique C proteins, which are basically nonessential accessory proteins. However, these C proteins are essential for efficient viral replication in cells and animals as well as for causing diseases. C proteins were reported to obstruct STAT1 activation after interferon stimulation, but it remained unclear as to how C proteins bind and affect STAT1 and inhibit transcriptional activation. Professor Sakaguchi, the principle investigator of this study, said ""using crystallography techniques, we examined how virus escapes from host-secreted interferons in virus-infected cells."" Professor Takemasa Sakaguchi and his research group at Hiroshima University determined the crystal structure of the complex of STAT1 and C protein. Their results suggested that the binding of C proteins and STAT1 dimer seems to force STAT1 to take up a parallel and inactivated form. ""The inactivated STAT1 form inhibits signal transduction by interferon, thus allowing SeV to escape the action of the host immune system,"" he explained. ""We need to continue to clarify the behavior of the STATs heterodimer formed by interferon alpha/beta stimulation in the presence of the C proteins. It is expected that the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition of interferon signal transduction by C proteins would then be fully identified. We are making efforts to apply these findings in the development of drugs against viruses such as human parainfluenza virus,"" Professor Sakaguchi described.","Published: October 19, 2015"

The researchers believe the test could be used in the clinic to make decisions about which patients should be given chemotherapy. Scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, analysed 177 tumour samples from patients with stage I non-seminomatous tumours enrolled in clinical trials through the Medical Research Council (MRC) Clinical Trials Unit. The work was funded by the MRC with support from the National Cancer Research Institute Testis Cancer Clinical Studies Group. Scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) found that three different features of the tumours were important indicators of relapse risk: the levels of a molecule called CXCL12, the percentage of the tumour with an appearance of cancer stem cells and whether or not blood vessels were present in the tumour. They scored tumours based on these features, and found that combining scores could divide patients up into three different risk groups based on how likely patients were to suffer a relapse of the disease within two years. It is rare for a patient to relapse from testicular cancer beyond this time. They found that the vast majority of patients were in the low-risk group - where 94.3 per cent of patients were relapse free for two years. In the moderate-risk group 65.9 per cent of patients were relapse free. Strikingly, only 30 per cent of patients were relapse free in the high-risk group. The researchers were able to validate the test in an additional group of 80 patients at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. Testicular germ cell tumours are the most common solid malignant tumour in young Caucasian men. Patients diagnosed with early-stage disease face a choice between monitoring with treatment if relapse does occur or upfront chemotherapy with its associated long-term side-effects. Predicting who does or does not need chemotherapy up front is therefore important to minimise treatment in this largely curable disease. Study leader Professor Janet Shipley, Professor of Cancer Molecular Pathology at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: ""Our research has led to the development of a test that can detect patients that will benefit from treatment up front and spare those who are at lower risk from the side-effects of chemotherapy. ""Chemotherapy is extremely effective in treating testicular cancer, but it can have long-term consequences for a patient's health and wellbeing. Patients deemed at low risk of relapse could simply be monitored and potentially could avoid chemotherapy. Approaches such as this to minimise chemotherapy are particularly important for cancers like testicular cancer, which affect young adults who could live with the side-effects for decades."" Professor Robert Huddart, Professor of Urological Cancer at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Consultant at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""Patients with stage 1 non-seminomatous germ cell tumours have to make a difficult choice of whether to be watched or to receive chemotherapy to reduce the risk of relapse. Our study may help men make this decision as among the three groups of patients identified we have found one with a very low risk of relapse where surveillance would seem to be best choice and a small group of men who have a very high risk of relapse who could be targeted with chemotherapy. We now need to test this prognostic index in larger groups of men in the clinic.""","Published: October 19, 2015"

That fact has been known for some time, but increasing evidence is showing that the human microbiome, the diverse population of microorganisms within every person, may play a key role in either setting the stage for cancer or even directly causing some forms of it. A new study from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, led by Erle S. Robertson, PhD and James C. Alwine, PhD, has identified, for the first time, an association between two microbial signatures and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive form of the disease.  ""Viruses and other microorganisms probably have much more to do with cancer, at least the propagation of cancer and promotion of it, than is really known,"" said Alwine, a professor of Cancer Biology and associate director for core services at the Abramson Cancer Center. Using a microarray technology called PathoChip containing 60,000 molecular probes to identify all known viruses and pathogenic bacteria, fungi, parasites, and other microorganisms, Robertson, a professor of Microbiology and his colleagues screened tissue samples from 100 TNBC patients.They also examined 40 matched and non-matched controls (matched controls are non-tumor tissue from TNBC patients; non-matched controls are breast tissue from healthy patients). The team found a distinct microbial signature distinguishing TNBC tissue from normal samples, which could be further delineated into two broad clusters, one predominantly viral and the other predominantly bacterial, with some fungi and parasites. ""If we look at this closely, we may also find some smaller clusters within those major groups that could give us some insights to unique identifiers for individuals in these clusters,"" stated Robertson, who is also associate director for global cancer research and co-leader of the tumor virology program at the Abramson Cancer Center. He explains that the team found ""about 30 organisms that provide a specific type of signature to give us clues for developing a diagnostic tool."" Co-authors Sagarika Banerjee, PhD, and Kristen Peck, from the Robertson lab, screened the organisms, and Michael Feldman, MD, PhD, and Natalie Shi from the department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, performed the pathology examinations to identify the TNBC cases. Among the most prevalent viruses detected were Herpesviruses, Parapoxviruses, Retroviruses, Hepadnaviruses, Polyomaviruses, and Papillomaviruses. Significant bacterial signatures includedArcanobacterium, Brevundimonas, Sphingobacteria, and Geobacillus, while fungal species Pleistophora and Piedra and parasitic organisms Foncecaea and Trichuris were among the prominent ones identified.   Alwine emphasizes that the detection of these and the other pathogens in TNBC tissues does not necessarily mean that they actually cause cancer. ""There are a lot of different ways to look at this,"" he pointed out. ""It's possible that some of the organisms we're looking at have a causative effect, but we don't know that. We can't say until it's been thoroughly tested by many more experiments."" One possibility is that the organisms could be adding something to the cellular microenvironment that helps damaged cells to become malignant or pushes them over the edge into cancer. Alternatively, certain organisms may simply find tumor tissue a favorable environment, without having any direct involvement at all with the cancer. ""They might just be there because it's a good place to hang out,"" Alwine said.  In either case, finding a distinct microbial signature associated with cancer raises the prospect of new diagnostic possibilities. ""We're looking at the signature as a potential for being able to diagnose cancer, possibly at an earlier stage,"" Alwine explained. ""We're looking at different cancers to find out whether or not there are specific signatures that go with specific cancers."" Robertson said. ""We are also trying to come up with ways in which we can look at blood samples to see if we can potentially develop a test to detect these signatures, which might provide an early surveillance system for identifying patients who might be prone to developing these malignancies.""           ""The microbial signatures may also have therapeutic implications,"" Robertson said. ""Many of these microorganisms can metabolize drugs and so their presence might diminish the effect of some drugs and might guide the ability to decide what to use for treatment of cancer,  Alwine said.  The research team next plans to explore these intriguing prospects in conjunction with the breast oncology group at Penn Medicine. ""We're not trying to say that any of these organisms are directly causing cancer,"" Alwine said. ""We're trying to identify the specific cancer signature, so that we can figure out ways to treat, control, or modify the cancer or treat the tumor-associated microbes, to prevent these malignancies in the first place. We've now opened up the doors to look more specifically at what these organisms are actually doing.""","Published: October 19, 2015"

One-third of these patients have seizures that are not controlled by medications. In addition, one-third have brain lesions, the hallmark of the disease, which cannot be located by conventional imaging methods. Researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) have piloted a new method using advanced noninvasive neuroimaging to recognize the neurotransmitter glutamate, thought to be the culprit in the most common form of medication-resistant epilepsy. Their work is published in Science Translational Medicine. Glutamate transmits signals from neuron to neuron, telling them when to fire. Glutamate normally docks with the neuron, gives it the signal to fire and is swiftly cleared. In patients with epilepsy, stroke and possibly ALS, the glutamate is not cleared, leaving the neuron overwhelmed with messages and in a toxic state of prolonged excitation. In localization-related epilepsy, the most common form of medication-resistant epilepsy, seizures are generated in a focused section of the brain; in 65 percent of patients, this occurs in the temporal lobe. Removal of the seizure-generating region of the temporal lobe, guided by preoperative MRI, can offer a cure. However, a third of these patients have no identified abnormality on conventional imaging studies and, therefore, more limited surgical options. ""Identification of the brain region generating seizures in location-related epilepsy is associated with significantly increased chance of seizure freedom after surgery,"" said the new study's lead author, Kathryn Davis, MD, MSTR, an assistant professor of Neurology at Penn. ""The aim of the study was to investigate whether a novel imaging method, developed at Penn, could use glutamate to localize and identify the epileptic lesions and map epileptic networks in these most challenging patients."" ""We theorized that if we could develop a technique which allows us to track the path of and make noninvasive measurements of glutamate in the brain, we would be able to better identify the brain lesions and epileptic foci that current methods miss,"" said senior author Ravinder Reddy, PhD, a professor of Radiology and director of Penn's Center for Magnetic Resonance and Optical Imaging. Reddy's lab developed the glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer (GluCEST) imaging method, a very high resolution magnetic resonance imaging contrast method not available before now, to measure how much glutamate was in different regions of the brain including the hippocampi, two structures within the left and right temporal lobes responsible for short- and long-term memory and spatial navigation and the most frequent seizure onset region in adult epilepsy patients. The study tested four patients with medication-resistant epilepsy and 11 controls. In all four patients, concentrations of glutamate were found to be higher in one of the hippocampi, and confirmatory methods (electroencephalography and magnetic resonance spectra) verified independently that the hippocampus with the elevated glutamate was located in the same hemisphere as the epileptic focus/lesion. Consistent lateralization to one side was not seen in the control group. While preliminary, this work indicates the ability of GluCEST to detect asymmetrical hippocampal glutamate levels in patients thought to have nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy. The authors say this approach could reduce the need for invasive intracranial monitoring, which is often associated with complications, morbidity risk, and added expense. ""This demonstration that GluCEST can localize small brain hot spots of high glutamate levels is a promising first step in our research,"" Davis said. ""By finding the epileptic foci in more patients, this approach could guide clinicians toward the best therapy for these patients, which could translate to a higher rate of successful surgeries and improved outcomes from surgery or other therapies in this difficult disease.""

By creating a consistent genetic analysis and diagnostic platform across these teaching hospitals, the agreement paves the way for the North to be at the forefront of rare disease diagnosis. Speaking about the agreement at the BIA Bioscience Forum, Dr Andy Richards CBE, chair of Congenica, the genomic diagnostic company, says:  Genomics is one of the fastest moving and most exciting areas in medicine and has the potential to make a real impact on patients lives, especially in areas like rare disease.  However, the success of these technologies, like so much of the future of medicine, is about getting innovation in its early stages close to patients in a real healthcare setting.  The NHSA has been one of the most forward thinking organizations in helping to introduce such technologies into its partner hospitals. We think that the selection of Sapientia as a platform across the NHSA serves as an excellent example of the sort of strategic alliance that can benefit innovation, UK companies, the NHS and most importantly patients.  Dr Hakim Yadi, CEO of the NHSA   the umbrella body for the North s leading universities, NHS teaching hospitals and Academic Health Science Networks   said: ""This is an example of how the North's universities and NHS teaching hospitals acting together can speed up procurement and partnerships without compromising on due diligence. This is a demonstration of how the North is and can be an even greater powerhouse in the health life sciences.  The NHSA links eight universities, eight NHS Teaching Trusts and the four Academic Health Science Networks (AHSNs) across the North of England; covering a patient population of over 15 million people. The NHSA acts as a single portal bringing together research, health science innovation and commercialization. Congenica s platform Sapientia has been developed to analyze and interpret whole genome data and has been validated by Genomics England. In June this year, the NHS Regional Genetics Service in Manchester became the first in the country to use genomic sequencing analysis supported by Sapientia. This enabled it to move from gene panel testing on small sets of genes, to whole exome testing, covering all known genes in a single test, which is a faster and more cost-effective method when diagnosing rare disease. Working with the NHSA, Congenica has made this technology available across the North of England with the region s leading NHS genetic testing centres also adopting the Sapientia technology. Central Manchester Foundation Trust (CMFT) will continue to be Congenica s lead reference laboratory and serve as the test site for further developments, which could then be rolled out to other NHS hospitals underneath the NHSA umbrella, acting as an opportunity for scale up across the country. This collaboration is a great example of how NHS centres can work together in a coordinated effort to evaluate and embrace pioneering technologies broadly and rapidly, making life easier for clinicians and ultimately bringing benefits for patients derived from reduced times for diagnosis.","Published: October 17, 2015"

The findings provide new insight into how epithelial cells in the inner ear develop and differentiate into specialized cells that serve critical functions for hearing and maintaining balance. Understanding how these important cells form may provide a foundation for the potential development of cell-based therapies for treating hearing loss and balance disorders. The research was conducted by scientists at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), part of the National Institutes of Health. In a companion study led by NIDCD-supported scientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and scientists at the Sackler School of Medicine at Tel Aviv University, researchers used a similar technique to identify a family of proteins critical for the development of inner ear cells. Both studies were published online on October 15 in the journal Nature Communications.  Age-related hearing loss occurs gradually in most of us as we grow older. It is one of the most common conditions among older adults, affecting half of people over age 75,  said James F. Battey, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., director of the NIDCD.  These new findings may lead to new regenerative treatments for this critical public health issue.  Specialized sensory epithelial cells in the inner ear include hair cells and supporting cells, which provide the hair cells with crucial structural and functional support. Hair cells and supporting cells located in the cochlea   the snail-shaped structure in the inner ear   work together to detect sound, thus enabling us to hear. In contrast, hair cells and supporting cells in the utricle, a fluid-filled pouch near the cochlea, play a critical role in helping us maintain our balance. These cells detect how we move our heads and how our heads are positioned; this information tells our brain, for example, whether we are standing or lying down. The utricle is one of several structures and organs in the body that provide our sense of balance; together, they comprise the vestibular system. Hair cells and supporting cells can be damaged by medications, infections or disease, injury, or aging, leading to hearing loss and balance problems. In humans, these cells cannot naturally repair themselves, so effective treatments are limited. In addition, there are only a few thousand of these sensory cells; they are tucked deep in a bony channel, making them difficult to study. To gain a better understanding of inner ear cell development, Matthew Kelley, Ph.D., chief of the Section on Developmental Neuroscience at the NIDCD, and his research team used single-cell RNA-seq, a new technology that can extract comprehensive gene activity data from just one cell. Other methods for obtaining this type of data typically require thousands of cells. Knowing which genes are active can tell scientists a lot about a cell s individual characteristics and function. Kelley s team analyzed 301 cells   some hair cells and some supporting cells taken from the cochlea and utricle of newborn mice. By comparing the cells  gene activity profiles, the researchers found unique patterns in hair cells and supporting cells. They also uncovered evidence for subgroups of cells within each of these classes. While little is known about these subgroups, the researchers speculate that the cells  distinct gene activity patterns may reflect specialized functions. The data also allowed the scientists to identify distinct developmental patterns of gene activity. Cells in the vestibular part of the inner ear develop at somewhat different rates, so each cell was at a slightly different point in its maturity when the researchers examined it. By analyzing the cells  gene activity profiles, the scientists were able to identify genes that are active at each stage of development, bringing to light important clues about how the specialized hair cells are formed.  Using this single-cell profiling technique provides a new option to identify the genetic activity of cells, particularly in systems with limited numbers of cells, like the inner ear,  said Kelley, senior author of the study.  Identifying the gene expression maps for the development of inner ear cells is essential to understanding how they form, and may help us create ways to regenerate these cells.  In the second study, researchers also took advantage of RNA-seq technology. Researchers used a computational-experimental approach to search for common regulatory regions in the genes expressed in the hair cells. The scientists found that a group of gene regulators called Regulatory Factor Xs (RFX) helps to drive genes that are preferentially active in hair cells. The researchers also showed that RFX genes have an essential role in hearing. Mice lacking two RFX proteins began to lose their hair cells and their hearing about two weeks after birth. After three months, these mice were completely deaf. The researchers concluded that the RFX gene regulators, while not crucial early in the development of hair cells, are necessary for the cells  maturation and long-term survival.","Published: October 17, 2015"

It appears smokers' brains are being primed for a bigger buzz from this common pain killer - which could put them at a higher risk for addiction, and possibly even overdose. ""We've known for some time that codeine was metabolized in the liver, but we've now discovered that this is also happening within the brain itself,"" says University of Toronto (U of T) pharmacology, toxicology, and psychiatry professor Rachel Tyndale, who is also senior scientist in the Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). ""Chronic nicotine use, or smoking, increases the amount of an enzyme that converts codeine into morphine within the brain, increasing pain relief. This may also make you more prone to addiction as the faster a drug gives you a high, the easier it is for you to learn the behavior and become addicted."" These findings, published earlier this year in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, are part a new way of seeing the brain's role when it comes to drugs and toxins. Instead of a passive target with receptors idly waiting for drugs, Tyndale has found that the brain is actually playing a much more active role than was previously thought. Enzymes in the brain are busy breaking down - or ramping up - the effect of drugs and other substances. Understanding these enzymes - and our genetic variation affecting our brain's metabolism - could help explain why people react differently to drugs and toxins, and even why certain people are more susceptible to complex diseases like Parkinson's. ""This is opening up a whole new area of research and potentially a substantial source of variation between people in their response to drugs and toxins acting on the brain,"" says Tyndale. ""We're starting to see patterns and relationships, like the nicotine and codeine connection. This is also of interest in drug development as we might be able to create drugs that are only activated once they get to the brain."" For this study, Tyndale, and her graduate student Douglas McMillan administered codeine to rats and measured their pain relief and levels of codeine and morphine. One group was given nicotine for seven days prior to the codeine. Another group received propranolol, which is known to inhibit the enzyme and block the activation of codeine. A third group received both nicotine and propranolol and a fourth was given neither, as a control. Tyndale found substantially more morphine and greater pain relief in the rats that had been given nicotine. Those who also received the inhibitor (propranolol) had less morphine in the brain and experienced less pain relief. The group that received the inhibitor and not the nicotine had the lowest levels of both brain morphine and pain relief. Despite this variation within the brain, the levels of morphine in the blood remained around the same for all groups - showing that it was variation in the activity of the enzyme within the brain, and not within the liver, that determined the effect of codeine on pain relief. People with more of this enzyme in their brain, whether due to genetic factors, smoking, vaping or other nicotine use, might be getting more pain relief but could be at greater risk of codeine dependence. ""This work could explain a lot of the mysteries when it comes to why people react so differently to different drugs, even when their blood levels seem to be similar,"" says Dr. Julia Stingl, a professor of translational pharmacology at the University of Bonn Medical School and a clinical pharmacologist who treats patients with depression and additions. ""Understanding the effects of smoking on metabolizing enzymes in the brain could have an extreme impact on clinical practice."" Nicotine increases codeine-induced analgesia. Credit: Rachel Tyndale  Variation in how people react to drugs has long puzzled clinicians and researchers. For example, certain people do not have any of the enzyme that converts codeine into morphine. For a time health care workers believed these individuals were abusing their medication - continually asking for more - when in fact they were not getting any pain relief. Tyndale's research into how the brain metabolizes drugs and toxins could expand our understanding of a host of unexplained associations. For example, researchers have found that smokers have a lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease compared to their non-smoking counterparts. Tyndale has found that the same enzyme that converts codeine into morphine - the one increased with nicotine intake - is also able to break down a toxin that causes a Parkinsonian symptom in rats. She's currently doing more research into this link. Another puzzle is a genetic variation in a different enzyme that, while tied to nicotine addiction, does not alter nicotine levels in the blood. Research in animal models by Tyndale, graduate student Kristine Garcia and U of T pharmacology professor and CAMH senior scientist Anh Dzung L  - which was also published this year in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology - found that the variation in activity within the brain indeed leads to changes in brain nicotine levels. As seen with humans, those with low levels of this brain enzyme have more active nicotine in their brains and are at greater risk of addiction to nicotine. As it turns out, the same enzyme is at play in converting a common herbicide used in agriculture into its toxic form. Viewing the brain not just as a passive array of receptors for drugs, but as an active metabolizer, stands to reveal important insights into how we react differently to a range of medications, drugs, toxins and even our susceptibility to certain diseases. Tyndale is currently expanding her research into variation in human brain enzyme activity, using a variety of experimental and imaging approaches.

The scientists were able to show that neurons, organized in a brain-wide network, albeit exerting different functions, coordinate with each other in a collective manner. They could also directly link these coordinated activities in the worm s brain to the processes that generate behavior. The results of the study are presented in the journal Cell. One of the major goals of neuroscience is to unravel how the brain functions in its entirety and how it generates behavior. The biggest challenge in solving this puzzle is represented by the sheer complexity of nervous systems. A mouse brain, for instance, consists of millions of neurons linked to each other in a highly complex manner. In contrast to that, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is equipped with a nervous system comprised of only 302 neurons. Due to its easy handling and its developmental properties, this tiny, transparent worm has become one of the most important model organisms for basic research. For almost 30 years, the list of connections between individual neurons has been known. Despite the low number of neurons, its neuronal networks possess a high degree of complexity and sophisticated behavioral output; the worm thus represents an animal of choice to study brain function. Researchers have mostly concentrated on studying the functions of single or a handful of neural cells and some of their interactions to explain behavior such as movements. For the worm, it has been known how some single neurons function as isolated units within the network, but it remained unknown how they work together as a group. Manuel Zimmer, a group leader at the IMP, wanted to address this unsolved question in his research. Together with his team, he combined two state-of-the-art technologies for the current study:  first, the scientists used 3D microscopy techniques to simultaneously and rapidly measure different regions of the brain; second, they used worms genetically engineered with a fluorescent protein that caused the worm s neurons to flash when they were active.  This combination was brilliant for us, as it allowed a brain-wide single-cell resolution of our recordings in real time,  Zimmer explains the advantages of this approach. Zimmer and his team tested the animals  reaction to stimuli from outside when they were trying to find food. Under the microscope, a fascinating picture was revealed to the researchers:  We saw that most of the neurons are constantly active and coordinate with each other in a brain-wide manner. They act as an ensemble , explains postdoctoral scientist Saul Kato, who spearheaded the study together with Harris Kaplan and Tina Schr del, graduate students in the Zimmer laboratory. The animals were immobilized for these experiments, their reactions therefore representing intentions as opposed to reflecting actual movement. With a different technique of microscopy, set up for freely moving worms, the scientists were able to detect the neurons that initiate movement. There was a direct correlation between the activity of certain networks and the impulse for movements; thus Zimmer and his co-workers could literally watch the worms think. These network activities not only represented short movements, but also their assembly into longer lasting behavioral strategies such as foraging.  This is something that no one has managed to do before , Zimmer points out. Suggestions of similar patterns of neural activity have been found in higher animals, but so far only a fraction of neurons in sub-regions of the brain could be examined at the same time. Zimmer and his colleagues are therefore confident that their results represent basic principles of brain function, even though the worm is only distantly related to mammals. Many questions in the area of neurobiology remain largely unsolved, such as how decisions are made or whether the brain operates in a formal algorithmic manner, like a computer. In the next phase of research, Manuel Zimmer intends to analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying the processes he investigated.  It would also be interesting to have a closer look at long lasting brain states such as sleep and waking , he says, laying out his ambitious plans for the future.

They have identified the structure of a key protein located in the brain, which is involved in body hydration and that could control temperature. The findings, which were recently published in Cell Reports, could have important clinical implications, as this protein could be a target for the development of treatments and diagnostic tests for many health problems associated with the imbalance of bodily fluids, commonly seen in the emergency room. ""We have identified what we think is the first protein that could allow the brain to monitor physiological temperature and it is important because this protein contributes to how the brain detects heat and triggers adaptive responses such as thirst,"" says Dr. Charles Bourque, the study's lead author and a researcher at the Centre for Research in Neuroscience at the RI-MUHC and at the Faculty of Medicine of McGill University. ""This protein, which is an ion channel, that regulates the flow of ions across the cell membrane, is thought to play a crucial role in balancing body fluids (water, blood, etc.) and sodium (salts) levels, and changes in its regulation could be involved in linking salt to hypertension, and provoking fluid retention following cardiac failure, sepsis or brain trauma."" Dr. Bourque's team is investigating how the brain controls osmoregulation which is the maintenance of salt and water balance across membranes within the body's fluids. Modification of osmoregulation can have major health consequences on humans. Indeed, sodium is necessary to regulate the water content in our body, as a result, high salt levels can be damaging for kidneys and increase blood pressure. According to Dr. Bourque, defects in the body's fluid balance are among the most common reasons for being hospitalized when admitted to the emergency room. For example, hyponatremia, a disorder that occurs when the level of sodium in the blood is abnormally low. Sodium is an electrolyte that helps regulate the amount of water that's in and around our cells. When this happens, the body's water levels rise, and brain cells begin to swell, leading to nausea, vomiting and headaches. It is known to be a very common problem in older adults and it can result in changes in cognition and even seizures. ''Now that we have discovered the protein's structure, we can try to understand how this ion channel is involved in conditions such as hyponatremia. This would give us tools to modify the channel's mechanism of action and either prevent or treat the condition,'' says study's first author, Cristian Zaelzer, Postdoctoral Fellow in Dr. Bourque's laboratory at the RI-MUHC. The discovery stems from previous work by Dr. Bourque's team in his laboratory at the Montreal General Hospital of the MUHC. In 2006, they demonstrated that a gene called TRPV1 played an essential role in detecting changes in balancing the body's fluids. Two years later, researchers discovered that the same gene was involved in detecting body temperature. However, the type of protein produced by the TRPV1 gene was still unknown. ""Collaborating with Dr. Bourque's group led to identification of a long sought-after TRPV1 ion channel that functions in neurons, making them sense osmotic pressure and temperature ,"" explains senior co-author Dr. Wolfgang Liedtke, associate professor of neurology, anesthesiology and neurobiology at Duke University. ""This ion channel becomes active during dehydration, switching on the neurons in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which instructs the body to act in order to maintain its fluid balance. This can be achieved by triggering a sense of thirst, and also by the secretion of vasopressin -- an antidiuretic hormone that acts to promote the retention of water by the kidneys -- to maintain body fluid balance."" ""Interestingly, our work also shows that the ion channel is an alternate product of the gene TRPV1 that normally codes for the capsaicin receptor that detects ""hot'' chilli peppers, adds Dr. Bourque. It is like nature has engineered a salt receptor out of a pepper receptor.""

DLB is the second-most common type of age-related dementia after Alzheimer's disease and is characterized by the accumulation of a protein called alpha-synuclein that collects into spherical masses called Lewy bodies -- which also accumulate in related disorders, including Parkinson's disease. This pathology, in turn, impairs the normal function of neurons, leading to alterations in critical brain chemicals and neuronal communication and, eventually, to cell death. The UCI researchers, led by associate professor of neurobiology & behavior Mathew Blurton-Jones and doctoral student Natalie Goldberg, hope that one day transplantation of neural stem cells into human patients might help overcome the motor and cognitive impairments of DLB. To test this idea, they transplanted mouse neural stem cells into genetically modified mice exhibiting many of the key features of DLB. One month later, the mice were retested on a variety of behavioral tasks, and significant gains in both motor and cognitive function were observed. For example, these mice could run on a rotating rod for much longer and recognize novel objects far better than untreated DLB mice. Neural stem cells (green) migrate throughout an injured brain site in DLB mice and begin to differentiate into astrocytes (red), leading to improved motor and cognitive function. Credit: Blurton-Jones lab, UCI  To understand how stem cell transplantation alleviated impairments, Goldberg and colleagues examined the effects of the stem cells on brain pathology and circuitry connecting neurons. They found that functional improvements required the production of a specific growth factor -- called brain-derived neurotrophic factor -- by neural stem cells. The team examined two of the key brain structures that become dysfunctional in DLB -- dopamine- and glutamate-making neurons -- to determine how BDNF might drive recovery. ""Our experiments revealed that neural stem cells can enhance the function of both dopamine-and glutamate-producing neurons, coaxing the brain cells to connect and communicate more appropriately. This, in turn, facilitates the recovery of both motor and cognitive function,"" Goldberg said. To further confirm the importance of BDNF in these effects, the researchers modified the stem cells so that they could no longer produce the growth factor. When these modified cells were transplanted, they failed to improve behavioral function and no longer enhanced dopamine and glutamate signaling. Testing the possibility that BDNF alone might be an effective treatment, Goldberg used a virus to deliver the growth factor to the brains of DLB mice. She found that this treatment resulted in good recovery of motor skills in the test rodents but only limited recovery of cognitive function. This, Goldberg said, suggests that while BDNF is critical to stem cell-mediated motor and cognitive recovery, it does not achieve this outcome alone. These results imply that transplantation of BDNF-producing neural stem cells may one day offer a new approach for treating DLB, and Blurton-Jones and Goldberg are cautiously optimistic. ""Many important questions remain before we could envision moving forward with early-stage trials,"" Blurton-Jones said. ""For example, we'll need to identify and test human neural stem cells first."" Nevertheless, if this approach holds up, BDNF-producing neural stem cells might also be beneficial for several other diseases. ""BDNF, dopamine and glutamate are implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions, including Huntington's and Alzheimer's disease,"" Goldberg noted.

In that time, the process has achieved almost 100 percent efficiency in transporting the energy of sunlight from receptors to reaction centers where it can be harnessed   a performance vastly better than even the best solar cells. One way plants achieve this efficiency is by making use of the exotic effects of quantum mechanics   effects sometimes known as  quantum weirdness.  These effects, which include the ability of a particle to exist in more than one place at a time, have now been used by engineers at MIT to achieve a significant efficiency boost in a light-harvesting system.  Surprisingly, the MIT researchers achieved this new approach to solar energy not with high-tech materials or microchips   but by using genetically engineered viruses.This achievement in coupling quantum research and genetic manipulation was the work of MIT professors Angela Belcher, an expert on engineering viruses to carry out energy-related tasks, and Seth Lloyd, an expert on quantum theory and its potential applications; research associate Heechul Park; and 14 collaborators at MIT and in Italy. Lloyd, a professor of mechanical engineering, explains that in photosynthesis, a photon hits a receptor called a chromophore, which in turn produces an exciton   a quantum particle of energy. This exciton jumps from one chromophore to another until it reaches a reaction center, where that energy is harnessed to build the molecules that support life.  But the hopping pathway is random and inefficient unless it takes advantage of quantum effects that allow it, in effect, to take multiple pathways at once and select the best ones, behaving more like a wave than a particle. This efficient movement of excitons has one key requirement: The chromophores have to be arranged just right, with exactly the right amount of space between them. This, Lloyd explains, is known as the  Quantum Goldilocks Effect.  That s where the virus comes in. By engineering a virus that Belcher has worked with for years, the team was able to get it to bond with multiple synthetic chromophores   or, in this case, organic dyes. The researchers were then able to produce many varieties of the virus, with slightly different spacings between those synthetic chromophores, and select the ones that performed best.  In the end, they were able to more than double excitons  speed, increasing the distance they traveled before dissipating   a significant improvement in the efficiency of the process. The project started from a chance meeting at a conference in Italy. Lloyd and Belcher, a professor of biological engineering, were reporting on different projects they had worked on, and began discussing the possibility of a project encompassing their very different expertise. Lloyd, whose work is mostly theoretical, pointed out that the viruses Belcher works with have the right length scales to potentially support quantum effects. In 2008, Lloyd had published a paper demonstrating that photosynthetic organisms transmit light energy efficiently because of these quantum effects. When he saw Belcher s report on her work with engineered viruses, he wondered if that might provide a way to artificially induce a similar effect, in an effort to approach nature s efficiency.  I had been talking about potential systems you could use to demonstrate this effect, and Angela said,  We re already making those,  Lloyd recalls. Eventually, after much analysis,  We came up with design principles to redesign how the virus is capturing light, and get it to this quantum regime.  Within two weeks, Belcher s team had created their first test version of the engineered virus. Many months of work then went into perfecting the receptors and the spacings. Once the team engineered the viruses, they were able to use laser spectroscopy and dynamical modeling to watch the light-harvesting process in action, and to demonstrate that the new viruses were indeed making use of quantum coherence to enhance the transport of excitons.  It was really fun,  Belcher says.  A group of us who spoke different [scientific] languages worked closely together, to both make this class of organisms, and analyze the data. That s why I m so excited by this.  While this initial result is essentially a proof of concept rather than a practical system, it points the way toward an approach that could lead to inexpensive and efficient solar cells or light-driven catalysis, the team says. So far, the engineered viruses collect and transport energy from incoming light, but do not yet harness it to produce power (as in solar cells) or molecules (as in photosynthesis).

The contract manufacturing organization (CMO) will increase floor space at its Scotland-based site by 20%, adding a new controlled temperature storage area and further room for its growing quality and project management teams. The extension comes just a year after the company was granted a commercial manufacturer s / importers license by the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for the GMP-manufacture of aseptically-filled licensed commercial products to complement its existing investigational medicinal product license. Its core business remains the sterile fill/finish of biologic and small molecule products into vials for clinical trials but the CMO has branched into providing a solution for increasing numbers of small scale commercial manufacturing projects. Colin MacKay, CEO at Symbiosis Pharmaceutical Services, said:  The decision to expand our facility comes both as a result of growing client demand for our small-scale sterile manufacturing services and also in line with the latest guidelines from the MHRA. This year s CPhI in Madrid is the ideal platform to communicate this news to the industry.  As we scale-up and regularly manufacture both commercial and clinical drug products, it s essential for us to plan ahead with regards to product segregation and storage to ensure we continue to meet the gold standard regulatory compliance guidelines demanded by the MHRA both now and in the future.  We are proud of our growing reputation in the global market for providing clients with rapid access to sterile manufacturing slots and quick release of drug products to ensure that our clients  tight timelines are met. With this in mind, it s important we accurately forecast to ensure we have the capacity to meet customers  needs and to underpin the strong relationships we have built with our clients.  Symbiosis has thrived in the last year as a consequence of wider industry trends such as the increased number of injectable drugs in development, increased biotech funding, and from more oncology and orphan drugs demanding the specialist manufacturing strengths of Symbiosis. The CMO specializes in injectable medicines, which are either liquid or lyophilized formulations filled into vials. Its specialist capabilities include the ability to handle and fill antibodies, proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, cytotoxic, cytostatic and highly potent APIs including ADCs along with conventional small molecules.","Published: October 16, 2015"

At least one in every two intensive care patient displays Systematic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). This clinical picture resembles sepsis but without any identifiable bacterial or fungal infection being present. Until now the exact cause of this syndrome was unknown. Researchers at MedUni Vienna Department of Internal Medicine II have now discovered a possible cause of this ""pseudo-sepsis"": the immune system mistakes the mitochondria that find their way into the blood following circulatory collapse or cardiac arrest for bacteria and so attacks them. The explanation for this goes back 1.5 billion years and is based on the so-called endosymbiotic theory.  The endosymbiotic theory states that, over the course of evolution, single-celled organisms have joined forces symbiotically to form a higher organism (endosymbionts). In this case, single-celled organisms absorbed bacteria, which then became their mitochondria, also known as the powerhouses of the cells, because it is here that the energy-providing molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is produced.  In the case of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), the results obtained by the MedUni Vienna researchers suggest that the immune system ""mistakes"" the mitochondria for the bacteria from which they originally arose (since the DNA structure of the mitochondria is the same as that of the bacteria) and so responds to them with an inflammatory reaction. ""When patients suffering from shock and organ damage release higher levels of mitochondrial DNA and this bonds to special signal-transmitting molecules, TLR 9 receptors, the risk of organ failure increases and the chances of surviving the disease decrease,"" explains Walter Speidl of the University Department of Internal Medicine II (cardiology department). Researchers now want to find out whether this ""pseudo-sepsis"" can be prevented by inhibiting TLR 9 receptors.","Published: October 16, 2015"

For artery cells, many Notch molecules need to be activated, whereas for hematopoietic cells many fewer are needed. According to Dr. Anna Bigas, the coordinator of the group on stem cells and cancer at IMIM ""to reach these levels of activation, we have proven that there is a competition between two proteins that activate the Notch molecule, i.e. between two ligands, in a way that one limits the activation generated by the other to form hematopoietic stem cells"". Until now it was known, thanks to the studies conducted by this same group and others, that the Notch activation was essential to form arteries and hematopoietic stem cells. It was also known that the proteins responsible for this activation were ligands Delta4 and Jagged1, respectively. With this study, researchers have shown how this signal works to reach a certain level of activation and form the two different types of cells. This is important to determine the signals that are necessary to generate hematopoietic stem cells in a laboratory, whether this is done with embryonic stem cells or from other sources. "" Currently stem cells are being obtained from laboratory with the features of stem cells, but the process is still not very efficient or reproducible. This study will help to improve the quality and efficiency in obtaining hematopoietic stem cells and this could mean that, in the future, it may be possible for many patients with no compatible donors to get a transplant"", the researcher comments. Researchers carried out this study using mice cells. Now, the next step will be to reproduce the study using human embryonic cells or programmed endothelium cells, where researchers are confident it will work in a similar way. Moreover, it is highly possible that similar mechanisms will also work to generate other types of cells. ""Although this is not immediately applicable because not all signals are known, nor how to regulate them, we are gradually drafting a more precise protocol to learn how to generate cells that can then be transplanted"", the researchers conclude.","Published: October 16, 2015"

And climate change is only making it harder for farmers to meet the global demand for food, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). By 2030, the IPCC expects climate change to reduce crop and pasture yields by as much as 14 percent in some parts of the world. Adapting crops, livestock and fisheries will be critical for global food security.  Simply adding more fertilizers and water to crops will not help farmers meet the demands for environmentally sustainable and improved yields,  said plant biologist Julian Schroeder, Novartis Chair and Distinguished Professor in the UC San Diego Division of Biological Sciences.  Growing more food with limited land for agriculture will require innovative approaches to improving crops.  To this end, the new Center for Research On Plant Transporters (CROPS) at UC San Diego, funded by a $6 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), aims to help develop the molecular tools necessary to grow the hardier crop varieties that farmers need now and will increasingly need in coming years   corn, wheat and rice that are more tolerant to heat, drought, salinity and other adverse conditions. CROPS will be led by Geoffrey Chang, professor in the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at UC San Diego and Department of Pharmacology in the UC San Diego School of Medicine. Plants are a completely new field of study for Chang   his biomedical research lab is known for determining the structure of transporter proteins embedded in the outer membranes of bacterial cells, where they play a role in multidrug resistance. Now, in collaboration with Schroeder, transporter bioinformatics expert Milton Saier, professor in the UC San Diego Division of Biological Sciences, and others, Chang will be applying the techniques usually used to study medically relevant bacteria to studying transporter proteins in crop plants. Transporter proteins direct the passage of virtually every molecule across plant cell membranes, including water, nutrients and heavy metals. Natural variations in transport proteins allow farmers to selectively breed crops for a variety of desirable traits. In one example, Schroeder s research team identified a sodium metal transporter gene that protects plants from salt stress, a factor that causes large crop losses in irrigated fields around the world, including California s Central Valley. Crop breeders in Australia and Asia are using natural genetic variants in this type of sodium transporter to breed salt-tolerant wheat and rice. To drive more advances like this, CROPS will be devoted to the functional and structural characterization of plant transporters. The CROPS team will provide transformative resources for the entire plant research community by producing purified plant transporters on a large-scale and generating antibodies that target transporter proteins. In addition, CROPS researchers will determine molecular structures of key plant membrane transporters and their natural variants, providing a new framework for understanding how transporters function and contribute to agriculturally important crop traits.  Food and health are interrelated,  said Chang.  By understanding how natural genetic variation translates into plant transporter structural and functional changes, we hope to find ways to better exploit these variations to improve crops, and, ultimately, improve well-being and quality of life for billions of people worldwide.

While many previous studies proposed ways M1 might contribute to strep virulence, researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine and Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences have uncovered a new explanation that may trump all others: M1 s ability to hold off antimicrobial peptides   natural antibiotics that comprise one of the immune system s front lines of defense. The study underscores the importance of antimicrobial peptides and hints at a new therapeutic approach to helping the immune system get a leg up on this crafty pathogen. The famous strep M1 protein has been shown to have numerous virulence properties that aid in bacterial colonization, fool the immune system or provoke inflammation,  said senior author Victor Nizet, MD, professor of pediatrics and pharmacy.  We found that a major contribution of M1 protein to severe invasive infections can be explained by its ability to inactivate antimicrobial peptides.  Group A strep is responsible for more than 700 million infections worldwide each year, most notably strep throat and  flesh-eating  skin infections. In response to strep and other bacterial infections, the body unleashes small antimicrobial peptides. These short chains of amino acids are lethal to bacteria in several ways   for example, by poking holes in bacterial membranes and by summoning reinforcements in the form of infection-fighting cells. Nizet s team examined M1 strep s ability to resist killing by one critical antimicrobial peptide called cathelicidin. They found that Group A strep lacking M1 protein were easily killed by cathelicidin, but were rescued when they were armed with added M1 protein. What s more, in a mouse model of M1 strep skin infection, it didn t matter if cathelicidin was present or not   the bacteria were just as virulent either way. In contrast, M49, a less virulent strain of strep, caused larger skin lesions in mice lacking cathelicidin than in normal, cathelicidin-producing mice. This suggests that M49 is unable to stiff-arm antimicrobial peptides the way M1 can, making the immune response more effective and the M49 bacteria less virulent. Other research groups previously reported that the M1 protein contributes to strep virulence because it makes it harder for immune cells to engulf the bacteria, or bind and inhibit other components of the immune system, such as antibodies. While those factors may apply to all Group A strep bacteria, it may be M1 s ability to keep antimicrobial peptides at bay that makes strains with this version of M protein so deadly. The findings underscore the need to fortify or optimize antimicrobial peptides in order to improve the immune system s odds of successfully fending off an infection, Nizet said. Understanding the interaction between M1 and antimicrobial peptides also provides a potential new approach to treating Group A strep infections.  It s conceivable that we could find a drug that breaks the M1-antimicrobial peptide connection, unlocking the immune system s ability to fight the infection on its own,  said first author Christopher LaRock, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Nizet s lab.","Published: October 16, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/fighting-pain-with-ketamine-194535,Fighting Pain with Ketamine Researchers at the Texas A M Health Science Center are using ketamine  a drug that already exists as an anesthetic  to treat pain  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The process to create an entirely new pharmaceutical is an arduous one. It can take years, or even decades, and billions of dollars to move a drug from development through the approval pipeline and into clinical use. To help overcome this obstacle, many scientists across the nation have begun rethinking the approach to pharmaceutical creation. Rather than starting from a blank slate, it has become much more efficient in both time and money to repurpose drugs that have already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), using them in novel ways to fight disease. And it s one of the reasons researchers at the Texas A&M Health Science Center are using ketamine, a drug that already exists as an anesthetic, to treat pain. It s a lot more economical to repurpose drugs than to take a new drug and make it from scratch,  said David E. Potter, Ph.D., professor and chair of pharmaceutical sciences at the Texas A&M Rangel College of Pharmacy,  not only in terms of dollars, but also in terms of time.  And because a treatment is less costly to develop, it should also be more affordable for the patient.  I think repurposing drugs is a good idea, because it is more rapid in terms of translation,  added Michelle Hook, Ph.D., an assistant professor at the Texas A&M College of Medicine,  and because you already know the side effects to some extent.  In the case of ketamine, some of those side effects have led to it being utilized as a  club drug.  Although ketamine has been used as a fast-acting anesthesia in clinical settings for the last five decades, its mind-altering side effects at higher doses, including hallucinations and the feeling of floating, make it a popular street drug. Researchers, including Potter and Hook, are now interested in using ketamine to treat pain, depression and tinnitus (or ringing in the ears), and they believe that it can be safe and effective at the correct doses.  We re doing this principally for pain, but when people have chronic pain, they also commonly develop varying degrees of depression,  Potter said.  Ketamine treats two diseases with one drug.  It may also be helpful for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and has been shown to be helpful for tinnitus.  It seems the more severe the tinnitus, the better it works,  Potter said,  because many of the same problems pain and phantom noises can predispose to depression and PTSD.  No approved drug currently exists on the market for tinnitus, so it s an unmet need, Potter said.  The group that suffers from tinnitus the most is soldiers out on the battlefield,  he continued.  We hope that ketamine will relieve pain, depression and if they suffer from it tinnitus as well.  Although there are numerous existing drugs for treating pain and depression, they re not adequate in all cases. Antidepressants can be slow to work, if they work for a patient at all. Pain relievers tend to be effective, but morphine can actually make a spinal cord injury worse, and all opioids carry the risk of dependency.  We do need other treatments for pain and depression,  Hook said. Ketamine acts quickly. Instead of the two or more weeks of a standard antidepressant like Prozac, Zoloft orEffexor, ketamine acts within minutes to hours which is vitally important in preventing suicide, especially as a single dose of the drug can significantly reduce suicidal thoughts. It can also help prevent opioid addiction.  Ketamine will prevent the sensitivity to pain that opioids produce when used chronically,  Potter said.  If you give this drug prior to surgery, it will actually lower the amount of opioids required to control pain after surgery, which helps lower the risk of opioid dependence, addiction and adverse effects.  The downside of ketamine is that it essentially disassociates parts of the brain from each other, which is what leads to the feeling of floating at high enough doses.  The hope is that the doses that are used for appropriate purposes will be low enough to not cause these effects,  Potter said. As with any drug, there is always more to learn. It is unclear whether there might be unintended side effects in certain populations, such as those with traumatic injuries.  If they want to use ketamine in the battlefield and the battlefield is a spinal cord injury-laden environment we really want to make sure that it s not going to kill cells and impede recovery,  Hook said.  We need to have science catch up and make sure that it is safe.  She is cautiously optimistic, but said that more testing is needed to see if these drugs will really work as expected. The researchers also plan to test ketamine in combination with another existing drug, brimonidine, which is currently approved to treat glaucoma. Potter hopes that the drugs will produce additive effects for treating pain while cancelling out the negative side effects of each other. For example, brimonidine will lower pressure in the eye and brain while ketamine tends to raise pressure, so in theory, giving them together should keep pressure stable.  We think that depression, pain and tinnitus use multiple (but similar) neurological mechanisms,  Potter said,  so it makes sense that you would need to use multiple drugs that act at multiple sites in order to control these conditions.

The new findings show that this molecule, named Vasotide in this paper, can be delivered in the form of eye drops, a discovery that offers a promising alternative to current therapies for these retinal diseases, which require monthly injections of large molecules directly into the eyeball. ""Angiogenesis, the abnormal overgrowth of blood vessels, underlies many severe diseases, and when angiogenesis develops in the eye's retina it causes decreased vision and can even lead to blindness,"" said the study's corresponding author Richard L. Sidman, MD, an investigator in the Department of Neurology at BIDMC and Bullard Professor of Neuropathology (Neuroscience), Emeritus, at Harvard Medical School. Sidman is a leader in the field of mammalian brain development whose studies have focused on disease mechanisms in mouse neuro-genetic disorders, including disorders of the retina, the light-sensitive layer of brain tissue at the inner surface of the back of the eye that transmits image information to other parts of the brain via the optic nerve. AMD develops in approximately 14 million older individuals throughout the U.S. This overgrowth of blood vessels damages the photoreceptor cells near the center of the eye's retina, resulting in the loss of central vision so that individuals can no longer see objects directly in front of them. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) occurs in premature infants, who develop a similar retinal disease as a side effect of high-level oxygen treatments used until their lungs develop sufficiently to handle the much lower oxygen levels in room air. In previous investigations, the study's co-senior authors Renata Pasqualini, PhD, and Wadih Arap, MD, PhD, of the University of New Mexico, had developed a laboratory screening technique called in vivo phage display and used it to identify an early version of this peptide. (A peptide is a short chain of linked amino acids, a small version of a protein.) In this new study, Sidman and his coauthors tested Vasotide in three separate animal models - two forms of AMD and one form of ROP. Their results showed that Vasotide led to decreased blood vessel growth in all three models when the agent was administered by either systemic injection, or through eye drops. ""Under normal circumstances, a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] binds to pertinent endothelial cell receptors lining the blood vessels, causing these cells to multiply, migrate, and form new blood vessels,"" he noted. ""Vasotide is the only external agent that uniquely blocks VEGF from binding to two different endothelial receptor molecules -- VEGF receptor-1 and neuropilin-1 -- to keep excessive blood vessels from forming."" Although a few other anti-VEGF drugs have been approved for therapy of AMD, they must be delivered directly into the eye through monthly intravitreal injections. ""These treatments are costly, require highly skilled professional execution, and, in rare cases, can cause bleeding or infection in the eye,"" said Sidman. Furthermore, he added, not all patients respond to these agents and, for many patients, responsiveness decreases after about six months. ""In addition to future clinical trials on AMD and ROP, we think that diabetic retinopathy and certain forms of cancer may also prove to be responsive to Vasotide,"" said Sidman. ""This is a very exciting development in that it has the potential to allow the self-administration of a sight-saving drug to patients with AMD,"" said Harold F. Dvorak, MD, Mallinckrodt Distinguished Professor of Pathology at HMS and BIDMC, whose laboratory first identified the VEGF signaling protein nearly 30 years ago.","Published: October 16, 2015"

Therapeutic strategies in Crohn's disease range from therapeutic diets to immunosuppressant drugs and antibiotics. However, effects of these treatments on the imbalanced, or dysbiotic, intestinal microbiome remain unclear.  The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America estimates that as many as 80,000 children in the United States may have inflammatory bowel disease, a broader term for Crohn's disease and the related disease ulcerative colitis. Crohn s disease is a debilitating disorder for all patients, but its early onset in children can cause additional problems such as stunted growth and delayed puberty, making the identification of effective treatments even more vital. Because immunsuppressant drugs can cause serious side-effects, there is great interest in developing new treatments that target the microbes living in the gut. This requires a better understanding of how gut microbes respond to different therapeutic approaches, the main objective of the current study. ""While antibiotics, inflammation and diet each impacted the composition of the gut microbiome, the effects were largely independent of each other,"" said co-first author James D. Lewis, MD, a professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. ""From this we concluded that the dysbiosis in Crohn s has many origins.""  The researchers used genomic sequencing to analyze fecal samples from 90 children with Crohn's disease as well as from 26 healthy children, tracking symptoms, inflammation, and microbial changes over eight weeks. The Crohn's patients were all undergoing treatment with a diet formula or immunosuppressant medications.  ""In all, we collected more than half a trillion bases of DNA sequence information, then used the data to characterize the behavior of gut microbes over time,"" said co-senior author Frederic Bushman, PhD, chair of the department of Microbiology. Each treatment had a distinct effect on the gut microbial community. The use of antibiotics, for example, suppressed bacterial growth but consequently facilitated the growth of fungi. The formula diet helped to reduce symptoms and decrease inflammation, but not by correcting the imbalance of the bacterial population. Under immunosuppressant therapy, inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis were reduced, but fungal dysbiosis persisted.  ""The formula-based diet helped the children to improve their symptoms and inflammation despite making the microbiota initially more dysbiotic,"" explained co-senior author Gary Wu, MD, a professor of Gastroenterology.  This is an intriguing finding implying that it may not be necessary to completely restore a healthy microbiome to provide a beneficial effect.  The study confirms that while dysbiosis is an important part of Crohn's disease, the reaction of gut microbes to different treatments can vary significantly. The discovery identifies important new research avenues to find novel treatment approaches and biomarkers that could be used to choose the right therapy for the right patient.  ""We are currently conducting a study designed to assess the impact of diet, including formula-based diets, and gut microbiome on metabolites found in feces and blood,"" Lewis said. The new insights on mechanisms of dysbiosis and their interactions with treatments promise better therapies and symptom management to find a better quality of life for children and adults with Crohn's disease.","Published: October 16, 2015"

Right now, there is no way to reverse this condition, largely because auditory hair cells, which sense sound and relay that information to the brain, do not regenerate. A new study led by scientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UM SOM) has found a key clue to how these hair cells develop. The current study identified a new role for a particular group of proteins, known as RFX transcription factors, in the development and survival of the hair cells. ""This discovery opens up new avenues, not only for understanding the genetics of hearing, but also, eventually for treating deafness,"" said the principal investigator, Ronna P. Hertzano, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at the UM SOM. The work was done in collaboration with scientists at several institutions, among them Ran Elkon, PhD, an Assistant Professor and computational biologist at the Sackler School of Medicine at Tel Aviv University in Israel. Hertzano and her colleagues used mice whose auditory hair cells glow with a green fluorescent protein, allowing the cells to be identified from other kinds of cells. They then used next generation sequencing - a state-of-the-art method to rapidly measure gene expression - to sequence and quantify the thousands of genes that are expressed in hair cells, in comparison with other cells in the ear. As they generated this catalogue of genes, they were searching for key regulators of genes for hair cells. Such regulators could help researchers eventually develop techniques to regenerate hair cells. The key regulator they identified were the RFX transcription factors. The scientists then moved on to study mice which had been genetically altered so that their hair cells lacked two of the RFX transcription factors. In these mice, hair cells initially developed normally, but then died quickly, leading to rapid hearing loss. By three months of age, the mice were profoundly deaf. Although the experiments were done in mice, Hertzano says that it is likely that these genes work similarly in humans. Eventually, she says, it might be possible to use our increased understanding of RFX transcription factor to treat hearing loss, by either protecting hair cells from death or fostering their growth. In addition, she and her colleagues think that they will be able to identify other genes that have an important role in hair cell function. Hertzano first got interested in the genetics of hearing as an MD-PhD student at Tel Aviv University, and then pursued residency training at the UM SOM Department of Otorhinolaryngology, where she now works as a scientist and a surgeon whose practice is focused on diseases of the ear and hearing restoration.","Published: October 16, 2015"

Gekara, research leader at MIMS, Molecular Infection Medicine Sweden at Ume  University. Our innate immune system is activated when our body needs to protect itself against pathogens, for instance bacteria and viruses, as well as for tissue healing. In some people, the immune system overreacts which can cause chronic inflammatory diseases and result in tumour development. The innate immune system is activated by receptors that recognise certain molecular patterns found on microbes or dead cells. These receptors are called pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs).  Most infectious or inflammatory situations are associated with the simultaneous or sequential activation of multiple PRR pathways. Therefore, it is essential to avert a disproportionate self-destructive immune response in a synchronised fashion once activated. How this is accomplished has been unclear,  says Nelson O. Gekara. Nelson O. Gekara s at Ume  University and his doctoral student Swarup Panda are now closing in on a solution. For years, they have been searching for possible genes required for the regulation of the immune system. Together with Professor Jonas A Nilsson at Sahlgrenska Cancer Center at the University of Gothenburg, the Ume  researchers have now identified MYSM1   a molecule in the cell core (nucleus) of resting cells. For the first time, the researchers are now able to show that during infection or inflammation MYSM1 accumulates outside of the nucleus, in the cytoplasm where it disrupts the function of signalling molecules involved in activation of PRR pathways, thereby terminating inflammation.  MYSM1 can be said to act like a molecular switch that can turn off several inflammatory pathways. Therefore lack of MYSM1 in animal results in unrestrained activation of the innate immune system, leading to inflammatory diseases  says Nelson O. Gekara. His research team is now screening for small molecule compounds that are able to modulate the MYSM1 molecule activity. The hope is to find new therapeutics against infections and other inflammatory diseases.","Published: October 16, 2015"

A sleep deficit of just four hours affects by as much as 50 percent the ability of stem cells of the blood and immune system to migrate to the proper spots in the bone marrow of recipient mice and churn out the cell types necessary to reconstitute a damaged immune system, the researchers found. Although the research was done in laboratory mice, the findings have possible implications for human stem cell transplants. Tens of thousands of these procedures, often referred to as bone marrow transplants but more properly called hematopoietic stem cell transplants, are performed each year to rescue patients with immune system disorders or cancers.  Considering how little attention we typically pay to sleep in the hospital setting, this finding is troubling,  said Asya Rolls, PhD, a former postdoctoral scholar at Stanford.  We go to all this trouble to find a matching donor, but this research suggests that if the donor is not well-rested it can impact the outcome of the transplantation. However, it s heartening to think that this is not an insurmountable obstacle; a short period of recovery sleep before transplant can restore the donor s cells  ability to function normally.  Rolls, who is now an assistant professor at the Israel Institute of Technology, shares lead authorship of the study with Stanford postdoctoral scholar Wendy Pang, PhD, and Ingrid Ibarra, PhD, the assistant director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute.Luis de Lecea, PhD, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, and Irving Weissman, MD, director of the Stanford Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, share senior authorship. Rested mice yield more effective stem cells Rolls studied laboratory mice that had been gently handled for four hours to prevent them from sleeping while their comrades dozed. She and her colleagues then collected stem cells from the bone marrow of drowsy and of well-rested mice and injected them into 12 mice that had received what would normally be a lethal dose of radiation. (The recipient mice also received an injection of their own bone marrow cells collected prior to radiation to make it possible to quantify the relative abilities of the donated stem cells to engraft successfully.)  The researchers then assessed the prevalence of a kind of immune cell called a myeloid cell, which were derived from the donated stem cells in the blood of the recipient mice, at eight and 16 weeks after transplantation. They found that, although stem cells obtained from well-rested donors made up about 26 percent of the myeloid cells in the animal over time, stem cells from sleepy donors made up only about 12 percent of the recipients  myeloid cells. We go to all this trouble to find a matching donor, but this research suggests that if the donor is not well-rested it can impact the outcome of the transplantation. Rolls and her colleagues compared the ability of fluorescently labeled stem cells from sleepy and from rested mice to migrate properly from the recipients  blood into the bone marrow. After 12 hours, 3.3 percent of stem cells from spritely mice were found in the bone marrow, versus only 1.7 percent of stem cells from sleepy mice. Further testing in the laboratory dish showed that hematopoietic stem cells from the sleep-deprived mice responded less strongly than their peers to naturally occurring chemical signals that trigger cellular migration. They also expressed lower levels of an RNA message that controls the expression of a family of proteins called SOC, known to inhibit the migration of hematopoietic stem cells. Letting tired mice catch up on sleep Although the effect of sleep deprivation was stark in this study, Rolls and her colleagues found that it could be reversed by letting the drowsy mice catch up on their ZZZs. Even just two hours of recovery sleep restored the ability of the animals  stem cells to function normally in the transplantation tests.  Everyone has these stem cells, and they continuously replenish our blood and immune system,  said Rolls.  We still don t know how sleep deprivation affects us all, not just bone marrow donors. The fact that recovery sleep is so helpful only emphasizes how important it is to pay attention to sleep. ","Published: October 16, 2015"

The Phase 3 study, which is expected to begin in the first half of 2016, will be co-funded by Incyte and Merck.  We are very pleased to expand our collaboration with Merck and to move the clinical development program for epacadostat in combination with Keytruda into Phase 3,  said Herv  Hoppenot, President and Chief Executive Officer of Incyte.  We believe the combination of these two immunotherapies shows promise and, if successfully developed, may help to improve clinical outcomes for patients with metastatic melanoma.   The initiation of this large Phase 3 study with Incyte in the first-line advanced melanoma treatment setting is an important addition to our robust immunotherapy clinical development program for Keytruda,  said Dr. Roger Dansey, senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories.  We continue to explore the benefit that Keytruda brings to patients suffering from advanced melanoma when used alone, and we are pleased to be able to add this important combination study with epacadostat to our Keytruda development program.  Under the terms of the agreement Incyte and Merck have also agreed, for a period of two years, not to initiate new pivotal studies of an IDO1 inhibitor in combination with a PD-1/PD-L1 antagonist as first-line therapy in advanced or metastatic melanoma with any third party. During this time, the companies will each offer the other the opportunity to collaborate on any new pivotal study involving an IDO1 inhibitor in combination with a PD-1/PD-L1 antagonist for types of melanoma and lines of therapy outside of the current collaboration agreement. The agreement is between Incyte and certain subsidiaries and Merck through its subsidiaries. Epacadostat and Keytruda are part of a class of cancer treatments known as immunotherapies that are designed to enhance the body s own defenses in fighting cancer; the two therapies target distinct regulatory components of the immune system. IDO1 is an immunosuppressive enzyme that has been shown to induce regulatory T cell generation and activation, and allow tumors to escape immune surveillance. Keytruda is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Preclinical evidence suggests that the combination of these two agents may lead to an enhanced anti-tumor immune response compared with either agent alone. Safety and efficacy data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study evaluating the combination of epacadostat with Keytruda in patients with advanced malignancies is scheduled to be highlighted as a late-breaking oral presentation (Abstract #142) at the upcoming Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer 30th Anniversary Annual Meeting & Associated Programs, November 4 8, 2015 at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, MD.","Published: October 16, 2015"

The contaminants are more prevalent in populated areas in the San Francisco Bay, suggesting that human impacts on nutrient input or other changes in water quality may enhance natural production. The study by an international team of researchers was led by the University of Minnesota. Collaborators on the project include the San Francisco Estuary Institute, Science Museum of Minnesota s St. Croix Watershed Research Station, ETH Zurich, and Pace Analytical.The contaminants studied are hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-BDEs) and are found around the world from the U.S. to Sweden to China. Recent evidence shows that the production of OH-BDEs occurs naturally from marine bacteria and algae. Levels of these chemicals have been increasing over time and have been detected in Baltic salmon, polar bears, bald eagles and human plasma. Previous studies have shown disruption of thyroid function and neurological development due to OH-BDEs.  Even though OH-BDEs are produced naturally, it shows that natural does not equal safe,  said lead researcher William Arnold, a professor in the University of Minnesota Department of Civil, Environmental and Geo- Engineering.  We need to find out why they are increasing.  The researchers looked at whether there might be a tie to flame retardants used extensively since the 1970s called polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Manufacturing facilities, sewage/wastewater, and precipitation are all known sources of PBDE pollution. Researchers also analyzed the popular antibacterial agent triclosan, which is chemically similar to OH-TriBDE. Because the onset of production of triclosan and PBDEs followed a similar timeline, the researchers hypothesized that the study would indicate common human-related pollution as the cause of OH-BDEs. From 2012-14, the researchers analyzed surface sediment and sediment cores in the San Francisco Bay, Point Reyes National Seashore and Minnesota lakes to determine a possible source for the increasing OH-BDEs. They found higher concentrations in San Francisco Bay compared to Point Reyes National Seashore, a marine system with limited human impact. They found no OH-BDEs in the freshwater lakes of Minnesota. The findings suggest that higher nutrients and water temperatures in the urban area of San Francisco Bay may influence microbial activity and increase OH-BDE levels. Small amounts of OH-BDEs were detected in the less populated Point Reyes National Seashore area, which accounted for a normal level of natural production.  We were surprised to find no OH-BDEs in the freshwater of Minnesota because flame retardants are used in Minnesota. This showed us that this is likely not the cause of OH-BDEs,  Arnold said.  But that s not the end of the story. There were still more OH-BDEs in the populated areas of San Francisco Bay, which highlights the complicated nature of human activity and how it affects our aquatic systems.

Cell Guidance Systems has developed a range of successful products used by medical researchers to study, maintain and direct the behaviour of cells and cell secretions. It has a loyal customer base, including pharmaceutical companies such as Astra Zeneca, as well as almost all major UK universities and many in Europe and the US. Revenues have increased by 40% to date in 2015, and now the company is seeking investment to scale up manufacturing, accelerate R&D and hire new scientists. It is also looking to play a more direct role in the development of regenerative medicines by continuing to develop its revolutionary Pods  (polyhedral delivery system) technology, which has the potential to transform medical care for a range of untreatable diseases with an urgent unmet medical need. Pods  enables growth factors, the chemicals currently in use to artificially stimulate cell growth, to persist in the body for months, transforming their therapeutic efficacy. In their current form, growth factors are unstable and stop working after minutes or hours making them unsuitable for use outside of lab experiments. The clinical potential of this technology is significant, offering real hope for individuals suffering from a myriad of conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson s and motor neuron disease, as well as stroke, cardiac diseases, organ failure and spinal injury. The technology also has potential for the delivery of oral vaccines. Pods  is covered by a set of four granted patents to which Cell Guidance Systems has exclusive, global rights in all fields, including therapeutics. Cell Guidance Systems is seeking further investment primarily to accelerate its research in this exciting area. It is looking to increase the numbers of growth factors that are available, scale up production and, alongside collaborators, test the growth factors in models of disease to demonstrate pre-clinical proof of concept. The lead investor on the funding round is Dr Steve Chambers, a founding partner of Adgen Ltd, a company which was sold to Nasdaq listed Neogen Corporation. Steve has remained with Adgen for the past 12 years, and is an angel investor focused on life sciences and biotechnology.

However, we might soon see them overflying crop fields with a very different purpose: a joint project by the James Hutton Institute, the University of Dundee and Survey Solutions Scotland is investigating the potential of drones for speeding up the development of new potato varieties. Potato breeding is not an easy task, due to the complexity of the crop s genetic system, yet significant progress has been made in the last century, notably for resistance and quality traits. Recent developments in genomics have radically altered the landscape for conducting genetic analysis, and have great prospects for impacting significantly on crop improvement. Dr Ankush Prashar, part of the James Hutton Institute s Enhancing Crop Productivity and Utilization research theme, said:  With the onset of climate change and increasing unpredictability across the UK, improved adaptation and yield responses of potato crops require accurate measurement of crop development under different climate scenarios. This evaluation relies on a combination of 'visual selection' as well as extensive and detailed genetic assessment, performed over several tuber generations.  Traits routinely assessed include yield, dry matter and multiple quality and resistance attributes. What is striking is that very few traits are measured in the field, and there is no systematic evaluation of traits such as canopy development and architecture, leaf area, responses to water and nutrient stress, and so it is impossible to estimate the effects of these variables on overall crop performance. It is possible that these traits may be highly correlated with yield or other important traits normally assessed after harvest.  Dr Prashar, in collaboration with Dr Hamlyn Jones from the University of Dundee and commercial partner Survey Solutions Scotland, is using a Trimble UX5 Aerial Imaging rover equipped with ground-based panoramic sensors to explore the feasibility of using 3D imaging for comprehensive assessment of complex traits like yield. Jock Souter, from Survey Solutions Scotland, commented:  We are very excited to be partnering the James Hutton Institute in this innovative project. The UX5 aerial imaging rover and the V10 360  terrestrial imaging rover deliver a comprehensive photogrammetric and geospatial dataset which the James Hutton scientists can use to assess the plant growth characteristics. Who d have thought the humble tattie could be so interesting?  The UAV uses the latest sensor and imaging technologies to collect large volumes of  in field  data at different developmental stages, to potentially increase both the efficiency of potato breeding and crop monitoring programmes. Trimble software is being used to create the mosaics by photogrammetric processing of both aerial and ground-based data, and will help monitor crop growth, development and final yield.  This technological platform will form a useful basis for a well-informed precision management practice. When combined with optimized breeding schemes this technology has the potential to substantially accelerate the development of new varieties for resilient and sustainable agriculture,  Dr Prashar added.","Published: October 16, 2015"

In the study, the vaccine elicited the expression of very high levels of polyclonal antibodies targeting multiple epitopes on Her2/neu. These epitopes include those two which are recognized by current blockbuster monoclonal antibodies Herceptin and Perjeta and which lead to ADCC (antibody dependent cytotoxicity). In addition, antibodies against Her2/neu epitopes so far not targeted by any licensed therapy were induced. These new epitopes allow tumor cell killing through complement activation (CDC), confirming the superior mode of action of polyclonal responses over current monoclonal treatments. Importantly, on top of the antibody response, OQR200 simultaneously induced polyclonal cellular immune responses to the breast cancer antigen, activating both helper T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells. Thus, OQR200 mobilizes and boosts the patient s complete immunological repertoire to combat the cancer cells. No adverse reactions were observed.  We are very pleased that this study has proven that OQR200 induces both high levels of antibodies and T-cell responses to Her2/neu-cancer cells , commented Dr. Geert C. Mudde, CSO of OncoQR.  The results of this study show that compared to other drugs OQR200 is capable of mobilizing and boosting both arms of the immune system against cancer cells: cellular and humoral immunity. Such a two-pronged approach is considered critical to prevent  tumor escape , a major limitation of current antibody treatments.  Dr. Mudde continued:  As an immunologist I am extremely excited that we could show that with our S-TIR  technology underlying OQR200, an autologous antigen can overcome immune tolerance. This has been a longstanding challenge for active cancer immunotherapy. Equally important for the clinical potential of our technology is the fact that the strong and broad immune reaction OQR200 induces is reversible, as the body will return to its natural state of tolerance for the auto-antigen after the end of the vaccination schedule, when immunization pressure is released. In addition, this also means that the immune response can be fined-tuned on a patient-by-patient basis to reach the individually desired optimal levels by shortening or increasing the time period between immunizations of the patient.   This study with OQR200 is the third indication in which our proprietary and highly versatile S-TIR  technology has shown proof of concept again in the absence of side effects , commented Christof Langer, MBA, CEO of OncoQR.  We are delighted that we could move OQR200 from drawing-board to pre-clinical proof of concept in just eight months. Our next goal is to find adequate partners that will help bring this promising breast cancer vaccine to the clinic as fast as possible.  Discussions with potential partners have already started, Langer added. Over the next months, OncoQR plans to use the versatile S-TIR   technology underlying OQR200 to initiate the development of further Adjustable Cancer Immunotherapies against undisclosed clinically validated targets.","Published: October 16, 2015"

These neurons, which are male-specific, are required for sex-based differences in learning, suggesting that sex differences in cognitive abilities can be genetically hardwired. This is important as very little is known about how brains vary to give the two sexes different preferences, aptitudes and judgments. The study by University College London (UCL, UK) and Albert Einstein College of Medicine (USA), published in Nature shows a direct link between contrasting behavior of male and female worms and differences in brain development and structure in areas involved in higher order processing. Senior author Dr. Arantza Barrios, UCL Cell & Developmental Biology, said: ""Areas of the brain involved in learning display sex differences in many animals, including humans, but how these differences directly affect behavior is not clear. ""We've shown how genetic and developmental differences between the two sexes lead to structural changes in the brain of male worms during sexual maturation. These changes make male brains work differently, allowing males to remember previous sexual encounters and prioritize sex in future situations."" The team were surprised to find previously unidentified cells are responsible for the behavioral change, as worms are an extremely well studied model organism. They were able to show that the cells from which these male brain neurons are born share common characteristics to the cells that give rise to human brain neurons. They are glial cells -- companion and support cells of neurons. Co-senior author Dr Richard Poole, UCL Cell & Developmental Biology, said: ""This is the first well-described example of glia making neurons outside vertebrates and is particularly exciting as we find that the glial cells in question are fully differentiated cells, an issue that has been tricky to address in higher organisms. ""We can now exploit this system to understand how fully differentiated glia can re-enter the cell cycle and generate neurons. This could have important therapeutic implications in the future."" The newly identified pair of neurons -- called 'mystery cells of the male' or 'MCMs' -- create behavioral differences between the sexes by changing a brain circuit common to both. Whether the neurons are born or not depends on the genetic sex of the glial cells from which they arise and not on the sex of the animal or on hormones. The MCM neurons are only made from glial cells that have male chromosomes. Dr Barrios added: ""Our findings suggest that differences in learning and perception depend not just on the sex of the animal but also on the sex of the individual neural progenitor cells. This means that different aspects of an animal's behavior may well develop independently of each other in some circumstances, instead of through the co-ordinated action of hormones. Of course not all behavioral differences are genetically hardwired, environment can also play an important role."" The worm species used in the study, Caenorhabditis elegans, has two sexes: males and hermaphrodites. These hermaphrodites are essentially modified females that carry their own sperm and do not need to have sex in order to reproduce. The MCMs were identified using fluorescently tagged markers and their function could be probed by surgically removing them using a laser microbeam. The effect of the cells on the worms' behavior was tested using classic conditioning behavioral assays in which worms learn to associate aversive or pleasant experiences (such as starvation or mates) with another stimulus (salt) and change their behavioural responses to that stimulus. Worms that were previously starved in the presence of salt, learned to move away from areas with high concentrations of salt when placed in a new environment that had various different salt concentrations. This indicated that worms had learned to perceive salt as a sign for the absence of food. Both males and hermaphrodites perform this type of learning. In contrast, when males were starved in the presence of salt and mates (i.e. sexual partners), and then placed in a new environment that had different salt concentrations, males sought areas of high concentrations of salt. This indicated that the association of salt with sex was stronger than and preferred over the association of salt with lack of food. This change in behavior does not occur in hermaphrodites. Importantly, it also does not occur in males whose MCM neurons were surgically removed--demonstrating that these neurons are required for sex-based differences in learning. The team at Albert Einstein College of Medicine used electron micrographs of serial sections to reconstruct and analyze the connections made by the MCMs with other neurons in the male brain. They found that the MCMs connected with neurons that are present in both sexes and that the presence of MCMs only in males remodeled these circuits to change the way information is processed. Co-author Professor Scott Emmons, from the Departments of Genetics and Neuroscience at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said: ""Only in C. elegans, at the moment, is it possible to identify every synapse in a neural circuit in the way we have done here. Though the work is carried out in a small worm, it nevertheless gives us a perspective that helps us appreciate and possibly understand the variety of human sexuality, sexual orientation, and gender identification."" The scientists hope to discover how glial cells make neurons, as it is a promising avenue for repairing damaged areas of the brain. They also want to determine what specific properties of brain circuits regulate the acquisition and retention of information in order to understand how learning occurs.

Neurosurgeons use their best judgment in the operating room but often must guess exactly where the edges of the tumor are while removing it. Even the state-of-the-art imaging equipment in today s operating theater still doesn t make the process much easier. But a new laser-based microscopic technology may help surgeons see the difference between tumor tissue and normal brain in real-time. Called a stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope, it s now being tested at the University of Michigan (U-M) Health System. Researchers have used the SRS microscope to image more than 60 patient samples since June   the first clinical test of the technology.  It allows the surgical decision-making process to become data driven instead of relying on the surgeon s best guess,  said Daniel Orringer, MD, the U-M neurosurgeon piloting the technology in collaboration with the Pathology Department at the University of Michigan Medical School. The team s latest research is published in Science Translational Medicine. Working with experts from several institutions including Harvard University, where SRS microscopy was developed, to the U-M team uses SRS microscopes to image brain tissue from neurosurgical patients.  We re able to visualize tumor that otherwise would be invisible to the surgeon in the operating room,  Orringer said. If the current test goes well, the technology could be submitted to the FDA for approval within two years. The team developing the SRS microscope hopes to create a product about the size of a microwave and more affordable than the imaging systems currently used, such as intraoperative MRI. Orringer believes removing the cost and space-capacity barriers will make this technology appealing to many surgeons.  This technology has the potential to resolve a long-standing issue in cancer surgery, which is the need for faster and more effective methods to assess whether a tumor has been fully removed,  said Richard Conroy, Ph.D., director of the Division of Applied Science & Technology at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering at the National Institutes of Health, which provided funding for the development of the technology. As U-M s Orringer and his colleagues continue testing the SRS microscope at U-M, they are building a second-generation system that can easily be operated during surgery. The next version of the device would sit close to the operating table. Surgeons could readily insert a fresh tissue sample into the device, which would generate microscopic images on the spot. The entire medical team would be able to use and understand the device easily and the images produced would help determine immediately whether more surgery is required. To get microscopic images today similar to what SRS produces, surgeons have to wait a half hour or more for tissue to be frozen, sectioned, stained and interpreted by expert pathologists trained to spot the difference between cancer cells and normal brain cells.  The ability to determine tumor margins without having to send samples to a pathologist could increase patient safety and improve outcomes by shortening the length of surgeries and reducing the number of cases where cancer cells are left behind,  Conroy said.  By optimizing surgical results, we re ensuring that the patients will have the best possible outcomes after brain tumor surgery,  Orringer said.

Now, neuroscientists at the university clinic Bergmannsheil in Bochum have further decoded the phenomenon, demonstrating that the optical illusion is linked to specific brain activation patterns. The study results have been published in the journal Cortex. One dress -- two perceptions. For some, it is black-blue, for others, it is white-gold. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, the neuroplasticity group headed by Prof. T. Schmidt-Wilcke solved the riddle of the illusion. In no time at all, the dress had captured the attention of media and scientists worldwide. Many renowned research institutes have explored the phenomenon from various angles, by analyzing the psychophysics or details of the image components. The Bochum researchers Lara Schlaffke, Lauren Haag and Anne Golisch now expanded the previous findings by providing insights into the differences in human brain activity caused by the contrasting perceptions. The Bochum study tested participants who perceived the dress as white-gold or black-blue, respectively. In an MRI scanner, brain activation of all participants was measured while they looked at the photo of The Dress via a computer-based presentation system. In the control condition, participants looked at colored squares with the same color properties as the photo of The Dress. In this control condition, no differences between the groups were identified in correctly naming the colors of the squares, nor in brain activation during the presentation of the colored squares. Subsequently, the researchers analyzed the brain activation in both groups during presentation of The Dress. They demonstrated that in a direct comparison of groups the photo triggered differential brain activation, depending on their perception. All participants who saw the dress as white-gold presented additional activation, mainly in frontal and parietal brain areas. Frontal regions are particularly involved in higher cognitive processes such as selective attention and decision making, while parietal areas process visual information from the occipital lobe. The phenomenon of The Dress provides a unique approach to researching visual illusions: for the first time, scientists had the opportunity to study a control group in a case of ambiguous perception. Before, no optical illusion existed with exactly two competing perceptions which could not be deliberately manipulated. By means of this phenomenon, the Bergmannsheil research group succeeded in identifying brain areas which cause optical illusions. ""These results expand our knowledge of illusion processing in the brain. Based on the research findings, we were able to quantify the brain areas involved in the process, thus we have laid a foundation for further research in the field of visual processing,"" conclude the successful women researchers, who otherwise deal with dresses in a different context.

The researchers inserted an optogenetic switch into a group of nerve cells located in the ancient part of the brain called the medulla, allowing them to activate or inactivate the neurons with laser light. When the neurons were activated, sleeping mice entered REM sleep within seconds. REM sleep, characterized by rapid eye movements, is the dream state in mammals accompanied by activation of the cortex and total paralysis of the skeletal muscles, presumably so that we don t act out the dreams flashing through our mind. Inactivating the neurons reduced or even eliminated a mouse s ability to enter REM sleep.  People used to think that this region of the medulla was only involved in the paralysis of skeletal muscles during REM sleep,  said lead author Yang Dan, a UC Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator.  What we showed is that these neurons triggered all aspects of REM sleep, including muscle paralysis and the typical cortical activation that makes the brain look more awake than in non-REM sleep.  While other types of neurons in the brainstem and hypothalamus have been shown to influence REM sleep, Dan said,  Because of the strong induction of REM sleep   in 94 percent of the recorded trials our mice entered REM sleep within seconds of activating the neurons   we think this might be a critical node of a relatively small network that makes the decision whether you go into dream sleep or not.  The UC Berkeley team report their results this month in the journal Nature. The discovery will not only help researchers better understand the complex control of sleep and dreaming in the brain, the researchers said, but will allow scientists to stop and start dreaming at will in mice to learn why we dream.  Many psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, are correlated with changes in REM sleep, and some widely used drugs affect REM sleep, so it seems to be a sensitive indicator of mental and emotional health,  said first author Franz Weber, a UC Berkeley postdoctoral fellow.  We are hoping that studying the sleep circuit might lead us to new insights into these disorders as well as neurological diseases that affect sleep, like Parkinson s and Alzheimer s diseases.  The researchers also found that activating these brain cells while the mice were awake had no effect on wakefulness, but did make them eat more. In normal mice, these neurons   a subset of nerve cells that release the neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), and so are called GABAergic neurons   are most active during waking periods when the mice are eating or grooming, two highly pleasurable activities. When a laser triggers an optogenetic switch in neurons in the medulla of a sleeping mouse, the animal goes from non-REM sleep (NREM) into REM or dream sleep. The axons of these neurons (green) reach into distant parts of the primitive brain, such as the hypothalamus, broadly affecting brain function. Credit: Franz Weber  Dan suspects that these GABAergic neurons in the medulla have the opposite effect of stress neurons, such as the noradrenergic neurons in the pons.  Other people have found that noradrenergic neurons, which are active when you are running, shut down when eating or grooming. So it seems like when you are relaxed and enjoying yourself, the noradrenergic neurons switch off and these GABAergic neurons in the medulla turn on,  she said. The GABAergic neurons project from the ventral part of the medulla, which sits at the top of the spinal cord, into many regions of the brainstem and hypothalamus, and thus are able to affect many bodily functions. These regions   more primitive than the brain s cortex, the center of thinking and reasoning   are the seat of emotions and many innate behaviors as well as the control centers for muscles and automatic functions such as breathing. Dan, Weber and their colleagues chose to use optogenetics to study these REM-related GABAergic neurons in the medulla. To target the virus to GABAergic neurons, the researchers used a genetically engineered mouse line that expresses a marker protein in these specific neurons only. Once present, the ion channel can turn on the activity of neurons when stimulated by laser light through an optical fiber inserted in the brain. Alternatively, inserting an inhibitory ion pump into the GABAergic neurons allowed the researchers to turn off the activity of these neurons through laser stimulation. Using this genetically engineered strain of mice, the researchers mapped the activity of these neurons in the medulla and then recorded how activating or inactivating the neurons for brief periods affected sleep and waking behavior. They also used a drug to inactivate the same set of neurons and found a reduction of REM sleep, though not as immediate and lasting for a longer period of time, since the drug required about half an hour to take effect and wore off slowly. They also inserted the light-sensitive ion channels into a different set of neurons in the medulla: glutamatergic neurons, which release the neurotransmitter glutamate. Activating these neurons immediately awakened the animals, the opposite effect of activating the GABAergic neurons. Dan is continuing her studies of the neurons that affect not only REM sleep, but also non-REM sleep. University of California, Berkeley   Original reporting by: Robert Sanders Dan Y et al.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/gaze-hinders-expression-283683,The gaze that hinders expression Autism  Altered connections between eye contact and facial mimicry  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Autism: Altered connections between eye contact and facial mimicry -It is not enough to observe what abilities are altered in those with autism, we also need to understand how each function interacts with the others. In fact, whereas in typical subjects, joint attention appears to facilitate facial mimicry (both are skills relevant for human social interaction), the opposite holds true for those with autism. That is what a new study, just published in Autism Research, suggests. Empathy -- the ability to identify and understand other people's emotions -- has many components, some sophisticated and involving complex thought processes, others basic but essential nonetheless. The latter include joint attention -- which is activated by direct eye contact between two or more individuals, and allows them to focus their attention on the same object; and facial mimicry -- the tendency to reproduce on one's own face the expressions of emotion seen in others. Subjects suffering from autism have difficulty with both these abilities, but according to the new research, it is also important to study how these two functions interact. ""Empathy is an essential human trait in social relations,"" explains Sebastian Korb, a researcher at the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) in Trieste, Italy and one of the study authors. ""According to embodied cognition theories, to better understand the facial expression of the person in front of us we reproduce the same expression on our face."" This does not necessarily mean that if we see someone smiling we smile as well, even though this does happen sometimes. More often, however, the facial muscles involved in smiling are indeed activated, but so subtly that the movement is invisible to the naked eye. The known difficulty autistic people have in interpreting other people's emotions could stem from reduced facial mimicry, since many studies have demonstrated that this function is defective in these subjects. Other studies have shown that joint attention is also impaired in autism, and this is another function that has huge relevance for social interaction. Nevertheless, the impairments in facial mimicry and joint attention in autism remain controversial and poorly understood. For this reason, ""we believe the interaction between these two abilities deserves plenty of attention,"" explains Korb. ""In our experiments, we saw that in persons with more pronounced autistic traits, joint attention tended to 'disturb' facial mimicry, whereas in normal subjects it facilitated it."" It should be noted that the 62 subjects who took part in the experiment were not individuals with a clinical diagnosis of autism. Instead, researchers used a questionnaire measuring the autistic tendencies of normal persons. In fact, it has been demonstrated that everyone has more or less autistic traits, although in most cases these tend to be mild and therefore do not lead to a diagnosis. During the experiment, the subjects interacted with an ""avatar,"" a three-dimensional interactive face (in the sense that it responded to the subject's gazing behavior). At the beginning of each trial, the avatar looked down, but as soon as the subject's gaze (monitored by means of an eye-tracking system) moved towards the avatar's eye region, the avatar looked up and he could either make eye contact with the subject (condition of joint attention) or avert his gaze and look up (condition of no joint attention). Subsequently, the avatar shifted his gaze to focus on one of two objects to the side, while the eye-tracker recorded whether or not the subject's gaze followed that of the avatar. At that point, the avatar could either smile or make an expression of disgust. During the trial, the subject's facial mimicry was measured by facial electromyography (a method used for recording muscle activation). ""What we observed is that in conditions of joint attention and where the avatar smiled, the subjects with more pronounced autistic traits tended to show less activation of the major smile muscle, whereas those with milder or no autistic traits showed a much more amplified expressive response,"" explains Korb. ""Individuals without autism tend to display a stronger empathic response (and facial mimicry) to persons with whom they have established eye contact and joint attention. However, if the subject has autistic tendencies then the eye contact can disturb and diminish facial mimicry."" ""In order to understand both the mechanisms underlying normal social interaction and the altered processes involved in autism, it is therefore important to observe not only which functions are impaired but also how these functions work together,"" concludes Korb.

Four leading experts on the global pharma outsourcing industry give their perspectives on the unique challenges that lie ahead in the near and medium term. The overall findings reveal that our experts see a continued growth in this sector, and predict further consolidation amongst players, as well as a transforming manufacturing environment with biologics increasingly taking a larger and larger share of global sales. The end result of which will be a smaller number of more flexible and adaptable CMOs and CDMO. All four experts agree that we are entering a crucial period, whereby the ability to move with changing regulatory standards and acquire new niche technologies will be integral in establishing strategic partnerships with pharma. Gil Roth, President, Pharma and Biopharma Outsourcing Association, states that unlike previous industry consolidations that were chiefly concerned with reaching a critical size and global reach. What we are now seeing is CMOs and CDMOs looking ahead for technologies that either enable them to work with clients earlier in the drug development chain or for solutions that help increase bioavailability   as this remains key challenge across most emerging drug targets. Moreover, a consequence of these processes being essential to a drug s manufacture, Hedley Rees (Managing Consultant at PharmaFlow Ltd) believes we will increasingly see pharma  locked-in  to certain partners as they are unable to source key platforms elsewhere. This is going to be especially true for biologics, as the regulatory approval is entwined with manufacturing process used during the clinical trial   although QbD may offer more flexibility, despite the high initial set-up costs. Another factor is the changing storage needs and volumes with biologics, which Hedley warns is at risk of breaking as new biologics, biosimilars and ATMPs arrive. Fiona Withey, Managing Director, UK Clinical Services, PCI Pharma Services, however, argues this is both an opportunity and a threat for the outsourcing community   particularly as many biologic targets are coming from virtual companies with no experience of managing the supply chain. This means that cold chain distribution amongst the CDMO community is going to be absolutely vital to those looking to garner an increasing share of the biologics market coming through into clinical and commercial production. And, in fact, new technologies for real time monitoring of the integrity of the supply chain are going to be sought as a means of competitive advantage. Additionally, market trends for custom parenteral delivery forms such as the auto-injector   to aid patient convenience for injectable medicines   will further complicate the global supply chain. Biocon CEO & Joint Managing Director, Dr. Arun Chandavarkar foresees a much wider global role for biosimilars in making biologics affordable and accessible, but is imploring Government and regulatory agencies to develop smarter and abridged regulatory processes to enable  speed to market  so that low and middle income countries can receive benefits sooner. He argues that regulators in these jurisdictions will also need to develop capability and confidence to operationalize their biosimilar guidelines if adoption is to be increased rapidly. Some of the challenges that the industry needs to address are:  Interchangeability  of biosimilars with their original biologic drugs, the recent naming convention guidelines and the long drawn patent litigations, which will determine th e future course. The new substitution policies in Australia and crucially, the FDA s impending guidelines on interchangeability. These will hopefully lead to simpler processes and faster adoption. However,  Emerging market regulators should be empowered to make the risk-benefit decisions that are most appropriate for the healthcare system in their country, and in many cases, to carve out faster clinical pathways than used in other countries with different risk-benefit equations. However, in all cases, they will need to ensure that the standards of quality and compliance for biosimilar products are at par with the best in the world.  states Dr Chandavarkar. Finally, Gil Roth also identified the upcoming GDUFA reauthorization in 2017 as a key moment for CDMO prospects in the medium term, as many are struggling with an overly stringent fee burden. And, his feedback from industry watchers is that they are skeptical U.S. regulations under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act will be implemented on time, but no one doubts that serialization will become the norm in the years ahead. Chris Kilbee, Group Director Pharma at CPhI:  Outsourcing is continuing to grow, but as the drug pipeline is shifting towards biologics and complex formulations we are seeing both the regulatory and business environment evolve. It is crucial that CMOs and CDMOs meet at ICSE to explore new partnerships, new ways of working, and technological collaborations that will be essential in formulating new targets. The short and medium prospects for contract services remain highly positive for those companies that can adapt to market and conditions. But it is clear that information and contacts are doing to essential for companies to remain pro-active rather than reactive and I would encourage all our exhibitors to study our experts findings closely.","Published: October 15, 2015"

They began to trace how some of these abnormalities affect the course of the disease and its susceptibility to treatment. And they started tracking the evolutionary path of CLL, as its ever-churning genome spawns new groups and subgroups of tumor cells in a single patient. This type of information is critical as the treatment of CLL is increasingly geared to the unique genetic features of each patient s tumor. Traditional chemotherapy regimens are now being supplemented by drugs that target the specific set of delinquent genes within cancer cells. Sequencing the DNA of CLL has taught us a great deal about the genetic basis of the disease,  said Catherine Wu, MD, of Dana-Farber, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and Brigham and Women s Hospital, a senior author of the study, which is being published today by the journal Nature.  Previous studies, however, were limited by the relatively small number of tumor tissue samples analyzed, and by the fact that those samples were taken at different stages of the treatment process, from patients treated with different drug agents.  In our new study, we wanted to determine if analyzing tissue samples from a large, similarly-treated group of patients provides the statistical power necessary to study the disease in all its genetic diversity   to draw connections between certain mutations and the aggressiveness of the disease, and to chart the emergence of new mutations and their role in helping the disease advance,  she continued.  Our results demonstrate the range of insights to be gained by this approach.   This study also provides a vision of what the next phase of large scale genomic sequencing efforts may look like,  said Dan Landau MD, PhD, of Dana-Farber, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and Brigham and Women s Hospital, a first author of the study.  The growing sample size allows us to start engaging deeply with the complex interplay between different mutations found in any individual tumor, as well as reconstructs the evolutionary trajectories in which these mutations are acquired to allow the malignancy to thrive and overcome therapy.  Wu and her team collected tumor and normal tissue samples from 538 patients with CLL, 278 of whom had participated in a German clinical trial that helped determine the standard treatment for the disease. They performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on each sample, reading the genetic code letter by letter in sections of DNA that hold the code for making proteins. An analysis of the data yielded a broad range of insights:  Researchers identified dozens of genetic abnormalities that may play a role in CLL, including 44 mutated genes and 11 genes that were over- or under-copied in CLL cells. Two of the mutated genes   RPS15 and IKZF3   have not previously been associated with human cancer.  Nearly 9 percent of the patients had mutations in the MAPK-ERK pathway, a network of proteins that relay growth signals. In some patients, researchers identified new types of molecular errors that allow the MYC cancer gene to become overactive.  Many of the mutations found in the BRAF gene occurred near, but not at, the spot most commonly involved in other cancers.  Certain gene mutations were found to be especially common in tumor tissue from patients who had already undergone treatment, suggesting that these mutations help the disease rebound after initial therapy.  Researchers compiled a rough draft of a  molecular biography  of CLL by determining which mutations tend to arise early or late in the course of the disease. They also identified mutations that often occur in pairs, one followed by the other.  The investigators found that therapy tends to produce shorter remissions in patients whose tumors carry mutations in the genes TP53 or SF3B1.  By comparing tumor samples collected prior to treatment and after relapse,  we found that genomic evolution after therapy is the rule rather than the exception,  Wu remarked.  Certain mutations were present in a greater number of leukemia cells within a sample after relapse, showing that these mutations, presumably, allow the tumor to persevere.  Wu and her colleagues observed three general patterns in these shifting mutations.  The breadth of our findings shows what we will be able to achieve as we systematically sequence and analyze large cohorts of tumor tissue samples with defined clinical status,  remarked Gad Getz, PhD, of the Broad Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital, co-senior author of the paper.  Our work has enabled us to discover novel cancer genes, begin to chart the evolutionary path of CLL, and demonstrate specific mutations affect patients  response to therapy. These discoveries will form the basis for precision medicine of CLL and other tumor types. ","Published: October 15, 2015"

The Cell Therapy Catapult is a global leader in the development of cell therapies with the goal of accelerating the delivery of these therapies to patients, rapidly, effectively and efficiently. The Cell Therapy Catapult has assembled best-in-class scientists, engineers and facilities in the UK to provide technical resources to ensure cell therapy products can be manufactured scalably and cost effectively. AST-VAC2 is an immunotherapy product that contains mature dendritic cells derived from pluripotent stem cells. AST-VAC2 is engineered to express telomerase, a protein widely expressed in tumor cells, but rarely found in normal cells. The AST-VAC2 dendritic cells are designed to instruct the immune system to generate responses against telomerase and hence tumor cells. To accelerate advancement of AST-VAC2, Asterias has an ongoing partnership with Cancer Research UK to execute the first stage of AST-VAC2 clinical development. As part of this partnership, Cancer Research UK will sponsor and manage a phase 1/2a clinical trial of AST-VAC2 in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. The clinical trial will examine the safety, immunogenicity and activity of AST-VAC2 in these patients and CR-UK will undertake the manufacture of the immunotherapeutic cells in support of this trial. Pluripotent stem cells, the source material for AST-VAC2, uniquely have expanded proliferative capacity in their stem cell state, yet they can be induced to form mature cell types of the body when specific culture conditions are used. These properties enable the use of pluripotent stem cells for the large-scale production of therapeutic cell types allowing manufacturing and distribution of cell-based products analogous to that of protein-based biologics. The joint program with the Cell Therapy Catapult will take advantage of these properties of pluripotent stem cells and will focus on the development of scaled production procedures for AST-VAC2 to supply future advanced clinical trials and commercialization of the product. The program will utilize the know-how and resources assembled at the Cell Therapy Catapult along with expertise in pluripotent stem cells at Asterias to industrialize production of pluripotent stem cell-based therapeutics.  The clinical trial being performed in partnership with Cancer Research UK is designed to establish the safety and activity of AST-VAC2 and will serve as a launch point for clinical development in lung cancer and other cancer indications alone and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors,  said Jane S. Lebkowski, Ph.D, Asterias  President of R&D and Chief Scientific Officer,  The new collaboration with the Cell Therapy Catapult will strategically fit with Asterias  objectives for advanced clinical development of AST-VAC2 by providing scaled manufacturing procedures enabling supplies for multiple clinical trials.  The collaboration with the Cell Therapy Catapult will trigger the initiation of an Asterias subsidiary in the UK.  The establishment of a subsidiary in the UK provides Asterias with the ability to effectively collaborate with both Cancer Research UK and the Cell Therapy Catapult Center at a low cost in the medium term while providing a base from which to grow our AST-VAC2 platform and maximize its value,  stated Pedro Lichtinger, Asterias  Chief Executive Officer.  This partnership with the Cell Therapy Catapult allows Asterias to accelerate its development of manufacturing processes that will be compatible with the commercial needs of our cell based products,  stated Katy Spink Ph.D., Asterias  Chief Operating Officer.  The collaboration also enhances our strategic relationships in the UK, an environment which facilitates and supports the development of regenerative medicine products.   Working with Asterias to scale up manufacturing of AST-VAC2 with our know how in pluripotent manufacturing technology is a project that the Cell Therapy Catapult relishes.

In addition, the only current treatment for JMML, a bone marrow transplant to replace the hematopoietic stem cells that become blood cells, is effective in only 50 percent of patients. This has further spurred efforts to understand related disease mechanisms as a step toward designing better treatments. ""By studying an inherited human cancer syndrome, our study clarified early events in the development of one kind of leukemia,"" said corresponding study author Bruce D. Gelb, MD, Gogel Family Chair and Director of The Mindich Child Health and Development Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. ""More than just creating a model of a disease, we were able to prove that mechanisms seen in our model also happen in the bone marrow of people with this kind of leukemia. The work also provided new targets for the field to develop new drugs against in JMML."" To better understand diseases with a genetic component, a popular approach is to take skin cells from patients with a disease and use enzymes to coax the cells back along the differentiation pathway to become induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs. Such cells can then be programmed to mature into cells, including hematopoietic (blood) cells, which re-create a specific version of each person's genetic disease in a petri dish for study. In the current publication, the study authors report that hematopoietic cells produced from induced stem cells with PTPN11 mutations known to cause JMML indeed act like cells seen in these patients. Researchers found that ""gain of function"" genetic changes that happen to increase this protein's expression were enough to cause leukemia-related changes in cells. ""Going into the current study, experts in the field had tended to lump all forms of JMML together, but the new study was able to isolate biological changes specific to hematopoietic cells with PTPN11 mutations, which causes more severe JMML,"" said Dr. Gelb. ""These findings provide a toe-hold in efforts to design specific treatments for this form of the disease."" iPSCs used to model cancers are often created from cancer cells, a process with comes with a great many mutations (changes in the gene code) in genes that are part of the unstable, frequent cell division and multiplication seen in cancer. By starting with skin cells of JMML patients with inherited PTPN11 mutations, researchers were able to create JMML cells with only these mutations, screening out the ""genetic noise"" that can obscure disease mechanisms. ""Our results provide further evidence that the severity of this form of leukemia arises from the degree of changes in the gene PTPN11, altering the protein it codes for, SHP-2, and biologic pathways related to it,"" said Dr. Gelb. ""These proteins promise to become a focus of future drug design efforts.""","Published: October 15, 2015"

The researchers, led by Matthew Freedman, MD, and Mark Pomerantz, MD, said they have identified the  first mechanistic insights into a key set of events  that prods normal prostate cells down the road to cancer. It s been a longstanding question, because few gene mutations have been found in prostate tumors.  This led us to wonder, is there another process going on?  said Freedman, of the Dana-Farber Center for Cancer Genome Discovery and Center Functional Cancer Epigenetics. The investigators spotted evidence of the cellular reprogramming when they compared normal and cancerous prostate cells from several patients. It is termed  epigenetic  because it controls how genes operate but doesn t make permanent changes in their DNA code. The androgen receptor is a protein activated by male hormones that turns on or off sets of genes that control prostate cell growth and other functions. The study demonstrated that this epigenetic program is fundamentally altered during prostate cancer formation. Because epigenetic reprogramming can potentially be reversed, the authors say it might be possible in the future to use drugs aimed at epigenetic targets to prevent or treat prostate cancer.  What we have observed is that there is a new epigenetic program occurring as you transition from normal to tumor cells,  said Freedman.  Maybe there will be a way to prevent this pattern from emerging, or perhaps we will be able to switch it back to the program being executed in normal cells.  Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men   except for skin cancer. About 220,800 new cases are expected in 2015, with about 27,540 deaths, according to the American Cancer Society. Because the tumors are fueled by testosterone, patients are often given drugs that prevent testosterone from activating the androgen receptor.  The androgen pathway is the central pathway in prostate cancer   it controls everything from the development of cancer to its progression and treatment,  explained Freedman. The androgen receptor is a transcription factor  a protein that latch onto specific DNA sequences in genes, called binding sites, to control how rapidly the DNA information is made into RNA. Transcription factor binding regulates the activity level of genes that operate the cell. The androgen receptor is like a set of keys that fit into thousands of specific locks   the binding sites   situated on the DNA blueprint of every prostate cell. When the investigators examined the androgen receptor-bound DNA of prostate cancer cells from several patients, they found that the receptor was now binding to a different set of sites, or locks, than in the normal cells.  We observed that the binding pattern in one man s tumor looked a lot more like the pattern in another man s tumor than it did like the pattern in his own normal cells,  said Pomerantz, physician at the Genitourinary Cancer Treatment Center at Dana-Farber. The androgen receptor had been reprogrammed to activate or deactivate genes in a way that spurred the prostate cells to grow and spread abnormally. They also discovered that two other transcription factors, FOXA1 and HOXB13, were critical in driving the androgen receptor reprogramming.  The marked redistribution of androgen receptor binding sites during tumorogenesis represents one of the most recurrent epigenetic or genetic alterations yet discovered in prostate cancer,  the authors wrote. Researchers from the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and from Brigham and Women s Hospital and Harvard Medical School are additional authors of the report.","Published: October 15, 2015"

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent cells that are capable of long-term growth, self-renewal, and can give rise to every cell, tissue and organ in the fetus's body. Thus, ESCs hold great promise for cell therapy as a source of diverse differentiated cell-types. Two major bottlenecks to realizing such potential are allogenic immune rejection of ESC-derived cells by recipients and ethical issues. Two Japanese scientists, Nobel laureate Shinya Yamanaka and Kazutoshi Takahashi, showed, in 2006, that introduction of four genes in skin cells can reprogram fibroblasts into functional embryonic stem-like cells (also termed  induced pluripotent stem cells  ( iPSCs ). The notion that as little as four genes are sufficient to completely change the cell, opened a new avenue where scientists have attempted to convert different adult cells into other somatic cell types. Several subsets of cell types such as blood cells, nerve cells, heart cells and liver cells were converted from different adult cells by employing the direct conversion approach.This discovery opened an attractive avenue that resolves both the ethical issue and the immune rejection problem of ESCs and the need for donor cells. Now, researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, led by Dr. Yosef Buganim at the The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada (IMRIC) in the Faculty of Medicine, have succeeded in converting skin cells into stable and fully functional placenta-generating cells (also termed induced trophoblast stem cells ( iTSCs )). Dr. Buganim is at IMRIC's Department of Developmental Biology and Cancer Research.  The placenta is the least understood human organ, but arguably one of the most important ones. It influences not only the health of a woman and her fetus during pregnancy, but also her lifelong health. Recurrent miscarriage and other placental insufficiency occur when the placenta does not develop properly, or is damaged. Placental dysfunction diseases are associated with low birth weight, premature birth and birth defects. One such disease is fetal growth restriction (FGR, also termed intrauterine growth restriction [IUGR]), that tends to display mild mental retardation and in severe cases causes fetal death. They also carry increased risk of complications for the mother. To date, tools to model or treat these diseases are limited because all attempts to isolate propagate the human placenta precursor cells in the dish have failed. In an attempt to generate full-function placenta-generating cells, Dr. Buganim and colleagues screened for genes that support the development of the placenta in the mouse model. They identified three genes (Gata3, Eomes and Tfap2c) that when introduced into skin cells, they could initiate a cell fate program that completely converted the skin cells into stable and fully functional placenta-generating cells. These skin-derived TSCs look like native TSCs, and function and contribute to developing placenta. Now, the main focus of the Buganim lab is to apply their technology to generate fully functional human placenta-generating cells. The success of this study will grant a real chance for women who suffer from recurrent miscarriage and placental dysfunction diseases to have healthy babies. It is important to note that these cells do not hold any risk since they integrate only into the placenta and not to the embryo itself.","Published: October 15, 2015"

The study also revealed genetic predictors of which patients are less likely to respond to existing treatments, which could help physicians quickly identify children who should be candidates for experimental therapies.  We ve created the most comprehensive portrait yet of how this cancer evolves from first diagnosis through remission or relapse,  said study senior author Mignon Loh, MD, chair of pediatric molecular oncology at UCSF Benioff Children s Hospital San Francisco.  What we found helps make sense of why patients  outcomes have been so wildly different.  JMML is an aggressive, chronic leukemia that mainly affects children under the age of four, and strikes one or two per million children in the United States each year. Currently, the only known treatment for JMML is a bone marrow transplant. This intensive approach, which has long-term side effects, only works in about 50 percent of patients, with relapse being the most common cause of treatment failure, said Loh, who is also a member of the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.   The goal of this study,  she said,  was to identify genetic alterations that we hope can identify targeted medications that can more effectively kill leukemia cells.  The course of JMML is also highly variable: very rare children spontaneously go into remission with minimal treatment, while fully half of JMML patients suffer from a highly aggressive form of the disease that fails to respond to bone marrow transplant. Not having any way to identify which children would respond well to treatment and which would not has been a major challenge for physicians, according to Elliot Stieglitz, MD, an assistant professor of pediatrics at UCSF who trained in Loh s laboratory during his fellowship is co-first author of the new study.  We have personally treated patients with JMML at UCSF with identical  driver  mutations, some of whom survived, while others died,  Stieglitz said.  Our frustration was the main impetus that led us to carry out this study.  Diverse genomics suggest new treatment options In the new study, the researchers used comprehensive whole-exome gene sequencing, assisted by novel computational algorithms, to compare the genomes of healthy blood cells to those of cancer cells at diagnosis and relapse in 27 JMML patients ranging from one month to three years of age. Based on the findings from these patients, they then performed targeted sequencing of suspected mutation hot spots in another 71 patients. Previously, just five defects in the Ras oncogene pathway had been associated with JMML. The new analysis added 10 new mutations of known oncogenes and tumor suppressors to the list of potential causes, including two additional Ras pathway genes. These new disease-associated mutations occurred in genes coding for proteins that function as signaling molecules, transcription factors, epigenetic regulators and elements of the spliceosome complex, a component of cells  DNA transcription machinery. Several of these newly discovered mutations raise the possibility of targeting subpopulations of JMML cases with existing drugs: Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, currently used to treat certain other bone marrow and blood cancers such as polycythemia vera, might inhibit signaling through a hyperactive JAK-STAT pathway identified in some patients, while other agents such as 5-azacytidine, most commonly used as a treatment for a blood disorder known as myelodysplastic syndrome, could be used to reduce excessive epigenetic DNA methylation seen in others. Mutation quantity, not type, predicts outcomes The team also performed a ten-year survival study with the same participants and found that patients  prognosis depended more on the number of mutations they had than on the specific mutations involved. Patients with more than one mutation at the time of diagnosis had a significantly worse long-term prognosis: Of the 34 patients who had at least two mutations, only 29 percent survived for ten years, compared to a 65 percent survival rate for patients who had one or fewer detectable mutations.  We have now shown that while  driver  mutations in the Ras pathway likely cause the leukemia to develop in the first place, it is the presence of these additional mutations that contribute to poor outcome,  Loh said, noting that therapies will likely require targeting multiple pathways at once.  Precisely how these secondary mutations will interact with the Ras pathway is the focus of our ongoing work.  For Loh and Stieglitz, the findings are more than academic.  At the beginning of my fellowship, we treated a delightfully precocious 2-year-old boy who eventually succumbed to JMML, despite world-class care,  Stieglitz said.  His family originally donated leukemia samples to us for research, and it was this patient s sample that led to the first major breakthrough in our study and will possibly impact the way certain patients are treated going forward.  As a result of these breakthroughs, Stieglitz said, their clinical team now offers CLIA-approved testing for the most common mutations seen in the new study, which can be ordered by any physician around the world.","Published: October 15, 2015"

The study demonstrated that the vaccine dramatically lowered cholesterol levels in animals. The study,  A Cholesterol-Lowering VLP Vaccine that Targets PCSK9,  was recently published by Dr. Bryce Chackerian, professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics & Microbiology at UNM, Erin Crossey, an MD/Ph.D. student at UNM, and Drs. Alan Remaley, John Schiller and Marcelo Amar at NIH. Genetic mutations that increase PCSK9 activity are linked to increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C the  bad  cholesterol), which in turn is associated with an increased risk of plaque build-up in the arteries leading to coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. More than 73 million adults in the United States (approximately 32 percent of the population) have elevated LDL-C levels, or high cholesterol.Although lifestyle changes and medication (such as statins) can lower LDL-C, more than 60 percent of at-risk patients on lipid lowering therapy still go on to have a cardiovascular event. Statins have side effects, including increased concentrations of liver enzymes, muscle pain, cognitive loss, increased risk of diabetes, and adverse drug interactions. As an alternative to statins, drug companies have developed monoclonal antibody-based drugs that target PCSK9, such as Alirocumab and Evolocumab that were recently approved by the FDA to treat high cholesterol. While these drugs have been shown to dramatically reduce LDL-C levels (by up to 60 percent) and cardiovascular events, they are extremely expensive, costing over $10,000 per year. This will likely limit the use of this class of drugs for those patients who cannot be effectively managed with statins or some of the other currently used cholesterol-lowering drugs. Additionally, monoclonal antibody therapies must be administered repeatedly for therapeutic effect. The vaccine uses a VLP (virus-like particle) technology developed by Dr. Chackerian and his UNM co-inventors as an immunogenic carrier of an antigenic PCSK9 peptide. VLP s are viruses that have had their DNA removed so that they retain their external structure for antigen display but are unable to replicate; they can induce an immune response without causing infection. VLP based vaccines are effective and safe and can be developed rapidly at low cost. In the study, mice and macaques vaccinated with bacteriophage VLPs displaying PCSK9-derived peptides developed high titer IgG antibodies that bound to circulating PCSK9. Vaccination was associated with significant reductions in total cholesterol, free cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides.  We believe that this vaccine could lead to a widely applicable approach for controlling hypercholesteremia and cardiovascular disease,  Chackerian said. The patent pending vaccine is good news not only for patients but UNM s technology-transfer organization, STC.UNM (STC) as well.  This technology is a strong candidate for successful commercialization and could be an entirely new and effective way of treating diseases that are a result of untreated high cholesterol,  added STC CEO Lisa Kuuttila.","Published: October 15, 2015"

The Warrington site worked closely with a forensic quality and validation expert, formerly with the UK Forensic Science Service, who confirmed its adherence to the proposed ISO 18385 guidelines. Thermo Fisher is the first company in the DNA forensics industry to demonstrate compliance with the proposed standard, which is designed to minimize human DNA contamination in the manufacture of reagents and consumables used for forensic DNA analysis.  My assessment has shown that there is a good correlation between the production of consumables at the Thermo Fisher Scientific sites in Warrington - Kingsland Grange and Newton House - and the requirements stipulated in the draft standard ISO18385,  Minimizing the risk of human DNA contamination in products used to collect, store and analyze biological material for forensic purposes,    said Kevin Sullivan, Ph.D., director at Principal Forensic Services, an internationally recognized and respected forensic scientist with more than 25 years of experience in validation and quality assurance gained through working for the Forensic Science Service. As part of its commitment to customers, Thermo Fisher collaborated with forensic practitioners and industry experts to define the draft manufacturing standard. Although uncommon, DNA contamination in a forensic DNA analysis laboratory can lead to erroneous results and thereby negatively affect the outcome of criminal investigations.  As a global leader in the forensics space, Thermo Fisher remains focused on serving its customers with products that meet the highest standards in the industry,  said Rosy Lee, vice president and general manager of human identification for Thermo Fisher.  Our decision to raise the bar and comply with the draft manufacturing standard is in line with our heritage of providing high-quality tools that enable forensic labs to trust the results when using our products.

The Mount Sinai study focuses on epigenetics, the study of changes in the action of human genes caused by molecules that regulate when, where and to what degree our genetic material is activated, rather than focusing on genetic changes in the DNA code we inherit from our parents. While scientists have traditionally focused on finding individual genes responsible for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), recent research has found links between epigenetic regulation and ASD in human patients.  Such regulation derives, in part, from the function of specialized protein complexes that bind to specific DNA sequences and either encourage or shut down the expression of a given gene. Mount Sinai researchers found that BETs, a family of epigenetic regulators that bind to many different genes and contribute to the copying of these genes into messenger RNA, the template used by the cell to make proteins, play a key role in the regulation of normal neuronal development and function.  The Mount Sinai study was conducted using a new type of pharmacological compound that does not inactivate BET proteins but, rather, prevents them from binding to the genes. The research team developed a novel, highly specific, brain-permeable inhibitor of BET proteins called I-BET858. The compound was initially tested on in vitro cultured mouse neurons.  The researchers found that it affected the function of a particular group of genes with known links to neuron development and synaptic functions.  Importantly a significant number of the affected genes have been linked to ASD in humans.  Subsequently, the study team evaluated the effect of I-BET858 when injected into mice. They found the compound was able to trigger selective changes in neuronal gene expression in the brain followed by development of an ASD-like syndrome.    We found that chronic daily administration of I-BET858 in young mice led to the development of behavioral abnormalities consistent with an autism-like syndrome, including reduced sociability and preference for social novelty   says Anne Schaefer, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor in the Department of Neuroscience and Psychiatry at the Friedman Brain Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who led the study.  One of the most important outcomes of our study is that we found a link between I-BET858-induced ASD and the altered function of a rather limited group of genes,  says Dr. Schaefer.  Furthermore, our findings reinforce the idea that ASD could be caused not only by genetic alteration, but by environmental factors that reduce the efficiency of gene transcription into full length RNA during brain development.   These studies also suggest that pharmacological modeling of ASD in mice provides a valuable tool for the identification of genes that may play a pivotal role in the disease pathology or for the development of novel drugs targeting ASD.

These events are directed by specialized proteins called ion channels that allow the flow of calcium ions in and out of cells and among cell compartments. For years, scientists have been unsure how calcium ion channels function. New atomic scale images of the structure of calcium's gatekeeper, IP3R, could go a long way toward solving this mystery and lead to treatments for the many diseases tied to channel malfunctions. The IP3R channel was imaged by scientists in the Department of Biochemisty and Molecular Biology at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth). Their findings appear in the journal Nature. ""We now know the structure of the gating machinery of IP3R,"" said Irina Serysheva, Ph.D., the study's senior author and an associate professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at UTHealth Medical School. ""This work will fuel many functional and translational studies and allow for new drug design venues."" When the IP3R calcium channel receives signals, it creates a pathway for calcium ions to move across cell membranes. While it works flawlessly most of the time, serious health issues occur when everything does not go to plan. ""Those health issues include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, cancer and stroke,"" she said. The study involved IP3R channel proteins that were purified from rat brain. The researchers used electron cryomicroscopy and computer reconstruction techniques to visualize the channel at near-atomic resolution. They then built a model representing the protein's atomic 3-D arrangement as it may exist in the cell. ""Knowledge of the 3-D structure of these channels is required to understand the molecular basis of channel opening and closing, and how this process is controlled by a wide variety of endogenous molecules and pharmacological modifiers,"" said Rodney Kellems, Ph.D., professor and chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at UTHealth Medical School.

In two separate studies, they show that the so-called dopamine stabilizer OSU6162 can reduce the craving for alcohol in alcohol dependent people and normalizes the level of dopamine in the brain reward system of rats that have consumed alcohol over a long period of time. However, thorough clinical studies are needed to determine if the OSU6162 also can help alcohol dependent people drink less alcohol. ""The results of our studies are promising, but there is still a long way to go before we have a marketable drug,"" says Pia Steensland, PhD, Associate Professo at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience of Karolinska Institutet, and co-author of both studies. ""The socioeconomic costs of alcohol are huge, not to mention the human suffering. It is inspiring to continue working."" Roughly a million Swedes over 15 years of age drink so much alcohol that they risk damaging their health, and it is estimated that some 300,000 of these people are dependent. Despite the pressing need, there are only a few approved drugs for the treatment of alcohol dependence, but their effects vary from person to person and the prescriptions rates are low. Consequently the hunt for new, more efficacious drugs for alcohol dependence continues. The studies of OSU6162 are based on the knowledge of how the brain reward system stimulates us to act in the interests of our own survival. Since dopamine creates a feeling of wellbeing, such as when we exercise or eat good food, the memory associates the two so that we will repeat the behavior. Alcohol makes the brain reward system release more dopamine than normal, creating a pleasant euphoric sensation. However, the more alcohol drunk, the more the reward system is desensitized and the less dopamine is released. With time, greater volumes of alcohol are needed to cause intoxication and eventually to attain a state of physical and emotional normality -- addiction has set in. In the clinical study, which is published in the scientific journal European Neuropsychopharmacology  the scientists examined for the first time if OSU6162 can reduce the craving for alcohol in people with alcohol dependence. Half the participants were treated with OSU6162 and half with placebo for a fortnight, after which both groups were exposed to different situations that could be assumed to elicit a craving for alcohol. The results show that the experimental group experienced less of a craving for alcohol after drinking one glass of an alcoholic beverage. ""At the same time, the OSU6162 group reported not enjoying the first zip of alcohol as much as the placebo group,"" says Dr Steensland. ""One interesting secondary finding was that those with the poorest impulse control, that is those thought to be most at risk of relapse after a period of abstinence, were those who responded best to the OSU6162 treatment."" A study of rats published at the same time in the scientific journal Addiction Biology adds to the understanding of how OSU6162 works, as it shows that rats that voluntarily consumed alcohol for almost a year had lower levels of dopamine in their brain reward system than rats that had never drunk alcohol. However, when the ""alcohol rats"" were treated with OSU6162 it was found that the substance counteracted the low concentrations of dopamine in the brain reward system. ""We therefore think that OSU6162 can reduce the alcohol craving in dependent people by returning the downregulated levels of dopamine in their brain reward system to normal,"" says Dr Steensland.

Headed by Nat lia Carulla, a specialist in biomedical chemistry at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), the study focuses on the number of molecules and shape that this protein has when it begins to aggregate, a process that leads to the so-called Abeta fibrils, the main components of the plaques observed in the brains of those suffering from Alzheimer s disease.  Comprehensive knowledge of the number of units and conformation of Abeta at the initial stages of aggregation is crucial for the design of drugs capable of breaking them up or preventing their formation,  explains Nat lia Carulla. The team at IRB Barcelona has studied the aggregation of two of the most common variants of Abeta, namely Abeta 40 and Abeta 42, with 40 and 42 amino acids, respectively, the latter being the variant most closely associated with Alzheimer s disease. The literature reports that while Abeta 40 self-aggregates to sequentially form dimers (two units), trimers (three units) and tetramers (four units), Abeta 42 self-aggregates to form pentamers (five units) and hexamers (six units). These findings have been cited more than 1000 times and consequently numerous studies have been based on this premise. However, IRB Barcelona researchers Rosa Pujol-Pina and S lvia Vilapriny -Pascual, the first two authors of the study, have observed that Abeta 40 and Abeta 42 goes through exactly the same aggregation states. The authors uphold that the results published to date are biased by the technique most widely used to study A  aggregates. The technique in question, SDS-PAGE, is characterized by the need for a small amount of sample and therefore is used for more straightforward studies. Using a new approach based on mass spectrometry and computational modeling and in collaboration with the IRB Barcelona groups headed by Marta Vilaseca and Modesto Orozco, respectively, Dr. Carulla s team has observed that both Abeta 40 and Abeta 42 form dimers, trimers and tetramers and that in these initial stages these aggregates are spherical lacking defined structure.  The structure that we have observed challenges the kind of structure accepted until now, the so-called beta-sheet. It should be noted that up to now drug design has been based on the premise of interfering with the beta-sheet structure. We believe that this strategy should be reconsidered and recommend caution when using SDS-PAGE to study Abeta oligomers,  states S lvia Vilapriny -Pascual. The experiments on aggregation have been performed with several techniques, including SDS-PAGE.  This study will lead to reservations on the part of the scientific community and that is why we have been thorough and present methodologically robust data,  says Nat lia Carulla.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-brain-controls-sleep-283682,How the brain controls sleep Brain structure generates pockets of sleep within the brain  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Brain structure generates pockets of sleep within the brain -Sleep is usually considered an all-or-nothing state: The brain is either entirely awake or entirely asleep. However, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) neuroscientists have discovered a brain circuit that can trigger small regions of the brain to fall asleep or become less alert, while the rest of the brain remains awake. This circuit originates in a brain structure known as the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which relays signals to the thalamus and then the brain's cortex, inducing pockets of the slow, oscillating brain waves characteristic of deep sleep. Slow oscillations also occur during coma and general anesthesia, and are associated with decreased arousal. With enough TRN activity, these waves can take over the entire brain. The researchers believe the TRN may help the brain consolidate new memories by coordinating slow waves between different parts of the brain, allowing them to share information more easily. ""During sleep, maybe specific brain regions have slow waves at the same time because they need to exchange information with each other, whereas other ones don't,"" says Laura Lewis, a research affiliate in MIT's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and one of the lead authors of the new study, which appears in the journal eLife. The TRN may also be responsible for what happens in the brain when sleep-deprived people experience brief sensations of ""zoning out"" while struggling to stay awake, the researchers say. The paper's other first author is Jakob Voigts, an MIT graduate student in brain and cognitive sciences. Senior authors are Emery Brown, the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering and Computational Neuroscience at MIT and an anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, and Michael Halassa, an assistant professor at New York University. Other authors are MIT research affiliate Francisco Flores and Matthew Wilson, the Sherman Fairchild Professor in Neurobiology and a member of MIT's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory. Until now, most sleep research has focused on global control of sleep, which occurs when the entire brain is awash in slow waves -- oscillations of brain activity created when sets of neurons are silenced for brief periods. However, recent studies have shown that sleep-deprived animals can exhibit slow waves in parts of their brain while they are still awake, suggesting that the brain can also control alertness at a local level. The MIT team began its investigation of local control of alertness or drowsiness with the TRN because its physical location makes it perfectly positioned to play a role in sleep, Lewis says. The TRN surrounds the thalamus like a shell and can act as a gatekeeper for sensory information entering the thalamus, which then sends information to the cortex for further processing. Using optogenetics, a technique that allows scientists to stimulate or silence neurons with light, the researchers found that if they weakly stimulated the TRN in awake mice, slow waves appeared in a small part of the cortex. With more stimulation, the entire cortex showed slow waves. ""We also found that when you induce these slow waves across the cortex, animals start to behaviorally act like they're drowsy. They'll stop moving around, their muscle tone will go down,"" Lewis says. The researchers believe the TRN fine-tunes the brain's control over local brain regions, enhancing or reducing slow waves in certain regions so those areas can communicate with each other, or inducing some areas to become less alert when the brain is very drowsy. This may explain what happens in humans when they are sleep-deprived and momentarily zone out without really falling asleep. ""I'm inclined to think that happens because the brain begins to transition into sleep, and some local brain regions become drowsy even if you force yourself to stay awake,"" Lewis says. Understanding how the brain controls arousal could help researchers design new sleep and anesthetic drugs that create a state more similar to natural sleep. Stimulating the TRN can induce deep, non-REM-like sleep states, and previous research by Brown and colleagues uncovered a circuit that turns on REM sleep. Brown adds, ""The TRN is rich in synapses -- connections in the brain -- that release the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Therefore, the TRN is almost certainly a site of action of many anesthetic drugs, given that a large classes of them act at these synapses and produce slow waves as one of their characteristic features."" Previous work by Lewis and colleagues has shown that unlike the slow waves of sleep, the slow waves under general anesthesia are not coordinated, suggesting a mechanism for why these drugs impair information exchange in the brain and produce unconsciousness.

The work is reported by Woo June Choi and Ruikang Wang of the UW Department of Bioengineering, in the Journal of Biomedical Optics, published by SPIE, the International Society for Optics and Photonics. ""The paper shows significantly enhanced imaging depth using a noninvasive laser-enabled technique for deep tissue imaging. In the brain, the imaging depth is almost doubled,"" said journal editorial board member Martin Leahy of the National University of Ireland, Galway. ""The authors demonstrate for the first time an application in which this capability opens up a whole new window into the live intact hippocampus, for discovery in brain research."" From the experimental findings, the authors envision that this new optical coherence tomography (OCT) approach to brain study may enable examination of acute and chronic morphological or functional vascular changes in the deep brain, which has been rarely attempted before in the OCT community. Choi and Wang used swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) powered by a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL). In ""Swept-source OCT powered by a 1.3  m vertical cavity surface emitting laser enables 2.3 mm-deep brain imaging in mice in vivo,"" they describe how this technique could allow researchers to monitor morphological changes caused by diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and even to study the effects of aging on the brain. The authors suggest that refining a VCSEL SS-OCT system may make it possible to do things that have been barely attempted in the OCT community, such as full-length imaging of a human eye from cornea to retina. OCT is used to obtain sub-surface images of biological tissue at about the same resolution as a low-power microscope. An OCT camera can instantly deliver cross-section images of layers of tissue without invasive surgery or ionizing radiation. Widely applied over the past two decades in clinical ophthalmology, it recently has been adapted for brain imaging in small animal models. Scientists have used OCT imaging to study the structure, neural activity, and blood flow in the cerebral cortex of live mice. Its application in neuroscience has been limited, however, because conventional OCT technology hasn't been able to image more than 1 millimeter below the surface of biological tissue. OCT images are based on reflected light directly reflected at sub-surface. At depths greater than 1 mm, the proportion of light (ballistic photons) that escapes without scattering became too small to be detected, so conventional OCT systems have not been able to image deeper tissues such as the hippocampus, where many pathologies originate. Recently, swept-source OCT powered by VCSELs has been developed, dramatically improving the usable imaging range because of its markedly improved system sensitivity. This new system offers a constant signal sensitivity to greater depths in tissue, extending the imaging range to more than 2 millimeters.

Children with the disease lose significant muscle strength early in life. The discovery stems from the persistence of a father -- Scott Frewing -- whose two sons were diagnosed with a rare and severe form of muscular dystrophy and his search for and partnership with the genetic scientist -- Dr. Elizabeth McNally -- who studies the disease. The rare form of the disease is Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2C.  McNally is director of the Center for Genetic Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and the former director of the Institute of Cardiovascular Research at UChicago, which is where she began the research. She also is a physician at Northwestern Medicine. The new therapy has been licensed to the Kurt+Peter Foundation, which supports Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 2C research and is being developed with the goal of clinical trials and eventual commercial treatments. The boys  family and friends started the foundation in 2010 to apply promising research to Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2C. Originally developed to treat Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, another form of muscle disease, exon skipping coaxes cells to  skip  over abnormal sections of the genetic code, so that the body can make a functional protein, which in this case, governs muscle function and development.  In the paper, lead investigator McNally summarizes her research in fruit flies and mouse models. Her team, which included Quan Gao a University of Chicago graduate student and Dr. Eugene Wyatt, a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern, demonstrated that protein made from exon skipping was functional to stabilize and slow progress of the disease. Working with human cells obtained from individuals with the disease, the team showed that exon skipping can be successfully induced with antisense compounds.  We recognize that this is version 1.0,  McNally said.  But if this can stabilize individuals with this disease, even if it gave them 10 more years of walking, that s huge. That would also mean 20 to 30 more years of breathing, and that is hugely beneficial for the patients and for their parents who are caring for them. And, of course, we re interested in developing version 2.0 that will be even better.  Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy is caused by mutations in any of at least 15 different genes and affects 1 in 14,500 to 1 in 123,000 annually. Individuals with Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2C have detrimental mutations in a key protein, gamma sarcoglycan, which is necessary for normal muscle development and function. The disease is an inherited disorder that is found in patients around the world and is prevalent in France, northern Africa and parts of South America. Although children with the disease are able to live normally at young ages, over time their deteriorating muscles prevent them from engaging in a number of typical childhood activities. Many of the children with the disease are in a wheelchair in their mid-to-late teenage years. Scott Frewing s sons, Kurt and Peter, were diagnosed with the disease in 2009 and 2010 respectively. The boys  family and friends started the Kurt+Peter Foundation in 2010 to apply promising research to Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2C. In 2010, Frewing, president of the Kurt+Peter Foundation, began proactively looking for scientists researching Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2C and similar forms of muscular dystrophy, with hope of supporting research to find a treatment. When Frewing approached McNally in 2010, she was one of the only researchers worldwide working on the disease. Frewing had heard of exon skipping and wondered if it would work for his boys. McNally didn t think that exon skipping would make the tiny relevant protein in the disease functional. But, after Frewing persisted, she did a predictive analysis, which showed that that less than half of the protein would be left, but that three key parts of the protein remained. The Kurt+Peter Foundation has provided annual grants to fund further evaluation and development of this potential therapy.  There are always new ways to treat a disease, and sometimes it is the patients and families who push us to think of these,  McNally said.  This partnership is a perfect example of how precision medicine can help address very rare diseases.  A new partnership among the University of Chicago, Northwestern University and The Kurt+Peter Foundation will support the development of therapies for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2C. The Kurt+Peter Foundation is licensing McNally s research and hopes to turn her discoveries in the laboratory into treatments that could help to slow the decline in muscle function. The Foundation will continue to partner with McNally to further test exon skipping in Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2C and develop the therapy. McNally and Frewing are looking to clear the hurdles necessary to begin clinical trials. Obstacles remain to commercialize the treatment, including the high cost of manufacturing the antisense oligonucleotides, the molecules that function to regulate gene expression that are necessary to make the treatment.   We are thrilled to be able to continue development of this promising treatment technique,  Frewing said. ""This is a terrible disease affecting children worldwide, and we hope to soon be able to provide families with treatment techniques that can lessen the disease s severity.  The agreement among the Kurt+Peter Foundation, UChicago and Northwestern is the first license UChicago has executed with a foundation.   This arrangement is a great example of how research institutions and foundations can bring their respective strengths and resources to the table and work together to develop new therapeutics for small groups of patients,  said Thelma Tennant, assistant director at UChicagoTech, the University of Chicago s Center for Technology Development & Ventures, the organization that negotiated the agreement between the foundation and institutions.  In a purely market-driven world, these patients would have very few options. ","Published: October 14, 2015"

While exploring why pregnant women are particularly susceptible to malaria, they found that the mosquito-borne parasite produces a protein that binds to a particular type of sugar molecule in the placenta. That discovery led to another: that same sugar molecule is also found in most cancers. This commonality is understandable, because both cancers and placentas grow rapidly, often pushing aside other tissues in the process. The Copenhagen and Vancouver researchers realized that the sugar molecule could be a target for anti-cancer drugs, and that the malarial protein, called VAR2CSA, could provide the tool for carrying such drugs to tumours.  Scientists have spent decades trying to find biochemical similarities between placenta tissue and cancer, but we just didn t have the technology to find it,  said project leader Mads Daugaard, an assistant professor of urologic science at UBC and a senior research scientist at the Vancouver Prostate Centre, part of the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute.  When my colleagues discovered how malaria uses VAR2CSA to embed itself in the placenta, we immediately saw its potential to deliver cancer drugs in a precise, controlled way to tumours.  To test that theory, Daugaard and colleagues enlisted the expertise of John Babcook and his team at The Centre for Drug Research and Development (CDRD). They attached a novel toxin to VAR2CSA and treated hundreds of normal and cancer cell lines. The drug compound specifically targeted and killed more than 95 per cent of the cancer cell lines. The drug was then tested on mice that were implanted with three types of human tumours. With non-Hodgkin s lymphoma, the treated mice s tumours were about a quarter the size of the tumours in the control group. With prostate cancer, the tumours completely disappeared in two of the six treated mice a month after receiving the first dose. With metastatic breast cancer, five out of six treated mice were cured from metastatic disease. The mice showed no adverse side-effects, and their organs were unharmed by the therapy.   This is an extraordinary finding that paves the way for targeting sugar molecules in pediatric and adulthood human cancer, and our groups are vigorously pursuing this possibility together,  said Poul Sorensen, a UBC professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and distinguished scientist with the BC Cancer Agency and co-senior investigator on the study.  There is some irony that a disease as destructive as malaria might be exploited to treat another dreaded disease,  said Ali Salanti, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the Centre for Medical Parasitology, at University of Copenhagen. Two companies, Vancouver-based Kairos Therapeutics and Copenhagen-based VAR2 Pharmaceuticals, are developing the compound for clinical trials in humans, which will take another three to four years.","Published: October 14, 2015"

Dr. Gallo s team includes his IHV co-workers George Lewis, PhD and Anthony DeVico, PhD, and Tim Fouts, PhDof Baltimore-based Profectus Biosciences, Inc., a spinoff company from IHV. Enrollment for the clinical trials began October 1, 2015. The candidate immunogen, denoted as the Full-Length Single Chain (FLSC), is designed to elicit strongly protective antibody responses across the spectrum of HIV-1 strains.  Maryland is one of the top science, bio-health, and research regions in the country and is home to some of the most brilliant minds in the world,  said Lt. Governor Rutherford.  I am especially proud to help announce this first phase of a potential HIV vaccine that is being developed by a talented team at UMD. The Hogan administration will continue to place a priority on supporting the Maryland universities, start-ups, and institutions that are making these groundbreaking discoveries.  The FLSC is distinguished by its potential ability to induce broad antibody responses to HIV-1. The antibodies induced by the experimental vaccine bind to common HIV regions that are exposed when the virus attaches to target cells, rather than to specific characteristics of the HIV envelope protein that may not be present in all virus strains. This strategy could potentially overcome limitations of previous vaccine candidates that responded to a narrower range of HIV strains.  Our HIV/AIDS vaccine candidate is designed to bind to the virus at the moment of infection, when many of the different strains of HIV found around the world can be neutralized,  said Dr. Gallo, widely known for his discovery of the first human retroviruses (including one which causes a specific kind of leukemia), co-discovery of HIV as the cause of AIDS, and the development of the HIV blood test.  We believe this mechanism is a major prerequisite for an effective HIV preventive vaccine.  This study is the first time the FLSC vaccine candidate will be tested in humans following the clinical product development of the vaccine construct led by Profectus Biosciences, Inc. These clinical trials are the next step in a program at the IHV to develop a preventive HIV vaccine funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the U.S. Army s Military HIV Research Program (MHRP), and other research funding from a variety of sources including the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

Some anti-leukemia treatments work by inhibiting Shp2 or other enzymes involved in the same cellular systems, but researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have now found that mice lacking both of these enzymes   Pten and Shp2   can t produce and sustain enough red blood cells. The study helps explain why anemia is a common side effect of anti-cancer drugs that target enzymes involved in tumor growth.   Based on this unexpected finding, we might want to think about screening cancer patients  genetic backgrounds for loss of Pten or Pten-regulated signals before prescribing anti-cancer drugs that might do more harm than good,  said senior author Gen-Sheng Feng, PhD, professor of pathology at UC San Diego School of Medicine.  In addition, this information could help guide better design of pharmaceuticals for leukemia and other types of cancer in the era of precision medicine. Feng and his team genetically engineered mice to lack either Pten, Shp2 or both enzymes. The Pten-deficient mice had elevated white blood cells counts, consistent with leukemia. The Shp2-deficient mice experienced the opposite   lower white blood cell counts. Mice lacking both Pten and Shp2 had relatively normal white blood cell counts. Yet the researchers were surprised to find that despite the apparent reversal of leukemia, the mice lacking both enzymes had shorter lifespans than normal mice or mice lacking just one of these enzymes. It turns out that combined deficiency of Shp2 and Pten induces lethal anemia. The researchers determined that the anemia they observed was due to two factors   red blood cells failed to develop properly from bone marrow and red blood cells that did form didn t last as long as they should. Without red blood cells, the body s organs and tissues don t receive the oxygen they need. To confirm these genetic studies, the researchers also treated the Pten-deficient leukemic mice with a Shp2 inhibitor or trametinib, a drug that inhibits another enzyme in the same cellular communication network as Shp2. Trametinib is widely used to treat pancreatic and other types of cancer, and it s known for frequently causing anemia in patients who receive the drug. Feng s team found that trametinib treatment had an effect similar to removing the Shp2 gene or chemical inhibition of Shp2   the mice were severely anemic.  What we ve learned is that even if we know a lot about how individual molecules function in a cell, designing effective therapeutics that target them will require a more comprehensive understanding of the cross-talk between molecules in a particular cell type, and in the context of disease,  said Feng, also a professor of biological sciences.","Published: October 14, 2015"

Tamoxifen treatment in mice also enhances clearance of the antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogen MRSA and reduces mortality.  The threat of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens is growing, yet the pipeline of new antibiotics is drying up. We need to open the medicine cabinet and take a closer look at the potential infection-fighting properties of other drugs that we already know are safe for patients,  said senior author Victor Nizet, MD, professor of pediatrics and pharmacy.  Through this approach, we discovered that tamoxifen has pharmacological properties that could aid the immune system in cases where a patient is immunocompromised or where traditional antibiotics have otherwise failed. Tamoxifen targets the estrogen receptor, making it particularly effective against breast cancers that display the molecule abundantly. But some evidence suggests that tamoxifen has other cellular effects that contribute to its effectiveness, too. For example, tamoxifen influences the way cells produce fatty molecules, known as sphingolipids, independent of the estrogen receptor. Sphingolipids, and especially one in particular, ceramide, play a role in regulating the activities of white blood cells known as neutrophils.  Tamoxifen s effect on ceramides led us to wonder if, when it is administered in patients, the drug would also affect neutrophil behavior,  said first author Ross Corriden, PhD, project scientist in the UC San Diego School of Medicine Department of Pharmacology. To test their theory, the researchers incubated human neutrophils with tamoxifen. Compared to untreated neutrophils, they found that tamoxifen-treated neutrophils were better at moving toward and phagocytosing, or engulfing, bacteria. Tamoxifen-treated neutrophils also produced approximately three-fold more neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a mesh of DNA, antimicrobial peptides, enzymes and other proteins that neutrophils spew out to ensnare and kill pathogens. Treating neutrophils with other molecules that target the estrogen receptor had no effect, suggesting that tamoxifen enhances NET production in a way unrelated to the estrogen receptor. Further studies linked the tamoxifen effect to its ability to influence neutrophil ceramide levels. The team also tested Tamoxifen s immune-boosting effect in a mouse model. One hour after treatment with tamoxifen or a control, the researchers infected mice with MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), a  superbug  of great concern to human health. They treated the mice again with tamoxifen or the control one and eight hours after infection and monitored them for five days. Tamoxifen significantly protected mice   none of the control mice survived longer than one day after infection, while about 35 percent of the tamoxifen-treated mice survived five days. Approximately five times fewer MRSA were collected from the peritoneal fluid of the tamoxifen-treated mice, as compared to control mice. There are two caveats, the researchers said. First, while tamoxifen was effective against MRSA in this study, the outcome may vary with other pathogens. That s because several bacterial species have evolved methods for evading NET capture. Second, in the absence of infection, too many NETs could be harmful. Some studies have linked excessive NET production to inflammatory disease, such as vasculitis and bronchial asthma.  While known for its efficacy against breast cancer cells, many other cell types are also exposed to tamoxifen. The  off-target effects  we identified in this study could have critical clinical implications given the large number of patients who take tamoxifen, often every day for years,  Nizet said. Tamoxifen is taken daily by hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide for the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. The World Health Organization considers tamoxifen an  essential medicine,  due to its cost-effectiveness and safety profile. According to the breast cancer organization Susan G. Komen, generic tamoxifen cost patients about $100 per month in 2010.","Published: October 14, 2015"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/building-a-better-liposome-189434,Building a Better Liposome Computational models suggest new design for nanoparticles used in targeted drug delivery  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Using computational modeling, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, the Colorado School of Mines and the University of California, Davis have come up with a design for a better liposome. Their findings, while theoretical, could provide the basis for efficiently constructing new vehicles for nanodrug delivery. Liposomes are small containers with shells made of lipids, the same material that makes up the cell membrane. In recent years, liposomes have been used for targeted drug delivery. In this process, the membrane of a drug-containing liposome is engineered to contain proteins that will recognize and interact with complementary proteins on the membrane of a diseased or dysfunctional cell. After the drug-containing liposomes are administered, they travel through the body, ideally connecting with targeted cells where they release the drug.This packaging technique is often used with highly toxic nanodrugs, like chemotherapy drugs, in an attempt to prevent the free drug from damaging non-cancerous cells. However, studies of this model of delivery have shown that in many cases less than 10 percent of the drugs transported by liposomes end up in tumor cells. Often, the liposome breaks open before it reaches a tumor cell and the drug is absorbed into the body s organs, including the liver and spleen, resulting in toxic side effects.  Even with current forms of targeted drug delivery, treatments like chemotherapy are still very brutal. We wanted to see how we could make targeted drug delivery better,  said Markus Deserno, professor of physics at Carnegie Mellon and a member of the university s Center for Membrane Biology and Biophysics. Deserno and colleagues propose that targeted drug delivery can be improved by making more stable liposomes. Using three different types of computer modeling, they have shown that liposomes can be made sturdier by incorporating a nanoparticle core made of a material like gold or iron and connecting that core to the liposome s membrane using polymer tethers. The core and tethers act as a hub-and-spoke-like scaffold and shock-absorber system that help the liposome to weather the stresses and strains it encounters as it travels through the body to its target. Francesca Stanzione and Amadeu K. Sum of the Colorado School of Mines conducted a fine-grained simulation that looked at how the polymer tethers anchor the liposome s membrane at an atomistic level. Roland Faller of UC Davis did a meso-scale simulation that looked how a number of tethers held on to a small patch of membrane. Each of these simulations allowed researchers to look at smaller components of the liposome, nanoparticle core and tethers, but not the entire structure. To see the entire structure, Carnegie Mellon s Deserno and Mingyang Hu developed a coarse-grained model that represents groupings of components rather than individual atoms. For example, one lipid in the cell membrane might have 100 atoms. In a fine-grain simulation, each atom would be represented. In Deserno s coarse grain simulation, those atoms might be represented by only three pieces instead of 100.  Its unfeasible to look at the complete construct at an atomistic level. There are too many atoms to consider, and the timescale is too long. Even with the most advanced supercomputer, we wouldn t have the power to run an atom-level simulation,  Deserno said.  But the physics that matters isn t locally specific. It s more like soft matter physics, which can be described at a much coarser resolution.  Deserno s simulation allowed the researchers to see how the entire reinforced liposome construct responded to stress and strain. They proposed that if a liposome was given the right-sized hub and tethers, its membrane would be much more resilient, bending to absorb impact and pressure. Additionally, they were able to simulate how to best assemble the liposome, hub and tether system. They found that if the hub and tether are attached and placed in a solution of lipids, and solvent conditions are suitably chosen, a correctly sized liposome would self-assemble around the hub and tethers. The researchers hope that chemists and drug developers will one day be able to use their simulations to determine what size core and polymer tethers they would need to effectively secure a liposome designed to deliver a specific drug or other nanoparticle. Using such simulations could narrow down the design parameters, speed up the development process and reduce costs.","Published: October 14, 2015"

""The evolution of these key virulence determinants doesn't occur in the same way as in other pathogens. Instead of gradually changing by mutation, like the flu virus, these malaria parasites exchange intact gene segments, like shuffling a deck of cards,"" said Caroline Buckee, assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard Chan School and senior author of the study. Malaria kills more than 500,000 people a year, mostly children in Sub-Saharan Africa. Severe disease syndromes in human malaria--including severe malarial anemia, pregnancy-associated malaria, and cerebral malaria--have been linked with the malaria parasite's ability to cause infected red blood cells to bind to the inner lining of blood vessels. This ability of the infected cells to adhere in this way--which is key to malaria's virulence--is linked with certain genes called var genes. Looking at hundreds of var sequence fragments using network analysis, the researchers discovered that short segments of these genes are shared across many different malaria parasites affecting humans, apes, and chimps. These segments are not recent adaptations, but rather reflect an ancient genomic structure. ""Astonishingly, we have found the very same shared sequence mosaics in these highly divergent species, implying that these short mosaic sequences, in spite of continual diversification, have an ancient origin,"" Buckee said. ""The origin of human malaria virulence factors is actually much older than previously thought.""","Published: October 14, 2015"

ITP is an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks platelets and blood fails to clot as it should.  Four in every 100,000 children develop the disorder each year globally.  The symptoms of ITP include bleeding and bruising more easily.  Frequent nose bleeds and bleeding from the gums can be common, and bruising often appears as purple patches or tiny red spots on the skin. On rare occasions bleeding can be life threatening. The condition may resolve by itself, but for one in every four of the affected children, the condition becomes chronic persisting after primary intervention and lasting for more than twelve months.  For eight-year-old George, a patient from Royton near Rochdale who was involved in the study, having chronic ITP meant frequent visits to A&E for nose bleeds that wouldn t stop and he would also miss out on social activities. George s mum, Joanne, explains:  George was diagnosed when he was four years old. I d find myself chasing after George trying unsuccessfully to wrap a very active little boy in cotton wool.  On this new treatment, George can make the most of his childhood and he recently celebrated his eighth birthday with friends in style at a trampoline park.  Historically, second-line treatment options for children with ITP have been scarce and, one of the earliest options, surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy) was associated with a high risk of sepsis and thrombosis.  A better understanding about the underlying cause of ITP led to the development of the use of newer immunosuppressant agents, including rituximab.  More recently, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (e.g. eltrombopag) have been approved for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic ITP who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to other treatments. Chief investigator, Dr John Grainger, Consultant Paediatric Haematologist and Honorary Lecturer at The University of Manchester, explains:  The studies, funded by GlaxoSmithKline, provide clinicians with much needed evidence to help decide when eltrombopag would benefit paediatric patients and provide dosage regimens suitable for paediatric patients.    The studies demonstrate that eltrombopag is well tolerated and effective, consistently stabilising the platelet count to over 50 X 109 per litre within 2 6 weeks for 40 per cent of children receiving the treatment, compared with 0 per cent on the placebo arm.  Life Sciences Minister George Freeman MP said:  This important research has the potential to bring real benefits to children suffering from rare and life threatening bleeding disorders. By investing more than  1 billion a year through the National Institute for Health Research we are giving our world leading life sciences sector the ability to trial the latest 21st century medical breakthroughs.  Professor Nick Webb, Director of the NIHR / Wellcome Trust Manchester CRF adds:  The first ever patient to be recruited to a clinical trial at our clinical research facility in Manchester was also the first patient globally to be recruited into the ITP study.  This research will enable patients to be more actively involved in school and social activities, and is also an historical milestone for the clinical research facility   affirming the value of having a dedicated children s research facility to test and tailor treatments to children s needs.  On the back of these studies eltrombopag was licenced by the FDA for use in children >1 year old.  EU licencing for this application is currently in progress.","Published: October 14, 2015"

This drug-triggered relationship induces the expression of the oncogene c-Myc, leading to reduced sensitivity to the cancer drug and eventually relapse.   We found that an epigenetic pathway is crucial for growth of HER2+ cells and this epigenetic factor reduces sensitivity of the cancer cells to lapatinib, a HER2 inhibitor,  said senior author Xianxin Hua, MD, PhD, a professor of Cancer Biology.  We need to understand how the body initially responds to these drugs and why there is a relapse and devise a new tool to fix that.  Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is upregulated in a subset of human breast cancers. The HER2 pathway is mutated in many cancers, which drives tumors, but inhibitors of this pathway, such as lapatinib, have only limited success because cancer cells quickly adapt. FOXO was normally thought of as the  good guy  molecule that controls cancerous cell growth, while c-Myc, the cancer-promoting molecule, the  bad guy.  However, FOXO becomes the agent that desensitizes cells to cancer drugs, so this  good guy  molecule is converted to a  bad guy,  during the treatment of the cancer cells with the anti-cancer drug.  Now that we know about this triangle among FOXO, c-Myc, and the epigenetic pathway, we can stop c-Myc with an epigenetic inhibitor,  Hua said.  Multiple epigenetic regulators participate in the drug-desensitizing pathway, so they could serve as new targets to improve therapy for this type of cancer.  The findings uncovered an adaptation pathway comprising the normally antagonizing molecules FOXOs and c-Myc, which are regulated by epigenetic compounds. Unraveling this complex interaction now gives researchers another point in the HER2 cancer pathway to hit. ","Published: October 14, 2015"

Nevertheless, a systematic characterization of these segments, called long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and their alterations in human cancer, is still lacking. Most studies of genomic alterations in cancer have focused on the miniscule portion of the human genome that encodes protein. An international team, led by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, has now changed all of that and published their findings this week. A team led by Lin Zhang, MD, the Harry Fields Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Chi V. Dang, MD, PhD, director of the Abramson Cancer Center, has mined these RNA sequences more fully to identify non-protein-coding segments whose expression is linked to 13 different types of cancer. Zhang first took this approach in 2014 to identify targets for ovarian cancer. Both of these studies are supported by the Basser Center for BRCA at Penn.  With non-coding RNA sequences constituting almost three quarters of the human genome, there is a great need to characterize genomic, epigenetic, and other alterations of long non-coding segments,  Zhang said.  The present study fills this significant gap in cancer research.  The team analyzed lncRNAs at transcriptional, genomic, and epigenetic levels in over 5,000 tumor specimens across the different cancer types obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and in 935 cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). They found that lncRNA alterations are highly tumor- and cell line-specific compared to protein-coding genes. In addition, lncRNA alterations are often associated with changes in epigenetic modifiers that act directly on gene expression.  We believe that the results from this multidimensional analysis provide a rich resource for researchers to investigate the dysregulation of lncRNAs and to identify lncRNAs with diagnostic and therapeutic potential,  Zhang said. The team also developed two bioinformatics-based platforms to identify cancer-associated lncRNAs and explore their biological functions. One is a searchable database that incorporates clinical information with lncRNA molecular alterations to generate  short lists  of candidate lncRNAs to study.  The molecular profiling data we used for this are linked to clinical and drug response annotations in the TCGA because of its high-quality, multiple-level profiles of human primary tumor specimens and detailed clinical notes for a broad selection of human cancer specimens, along with the CCLE, the best available resource for molecular profiles of cancer cell lines and details about their responses to drugs,  Zhang explained. The second approach they developed   predicting the biological function of lncRNAs --successfully identified a novel oncogenic lncRNA called BCAL8. They found that BCAL8, when overexpressed, works to promote the cell cycle, which controls cell division. This part of the study provided not only a proof of concept for their lncRNA search strategy, but also a customizable database for other investigators to look for lncRNAs of interest and investigate their function. This database is called the Cancer LncRNome Atlasand is administered by the Abramson Cancer Center at Penn.","Published: October 14, 2015"

By investing in liquid biopsy research and developing the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 for use with either plasma or tissue samples, Roche is helping to remove these common barriers from molecular testing.

Current methods used in food, water or clinical applications rely on labor and time-intensive culturing techniques while activities such as dairy farming, wastewater and runoff treatment necessitates real-time monitoring of pathogens in environment samples.  The study defines an accurate, inexpensive, high-throughput, and rapid alternative for screening of pathogens from various environmental samples.  This is the first study to comprehensively assess pathogen concentrations in such a broad variety of environmental sample types while achieving multiple pathogen detection with complete parallel testing by standard (or traditional) methods,  Orlofsky explains.   We accurately identified Salmonella (S. enterica) in environmental soil samples within 24 hours, while traditional methods take four to five days and require sorting,  Orlofsky says.  We also successfully identified a sometimes-fatal infection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in aerosols generated by a domestic wastewater treatment system. The results suggest that the developed method presents a broad approach for the rapid, efficient and reliable detection of relatively low densities of pathogenic organisms in challenging environmental samples.  To evaluate the technology, a variety of environmental samples, including aerosols, various soil types, wastewater and vegetable surface (tomato), was concurrently spiked with Salmonella enterica and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The researchers chose these pathogens because they are leading causes of illness,have high survival potential in the environment and are considered difficult to detect accurately at low concentration.   When applied to non-spiked field samples, our method outperformed the standard methods substantially, while detecting pathogens within a day of receiving the samples,  says Orlofsky.  Since this focused and economical screening procedure tells us exactly where to look within a day, we don t need to monitor hundreds of samples and sub-samples over several days.  The two techniques used concomitantly are an evolved  MPN-type enrichment  (""Most Probable Number"") used in microbiology testing, coupled with  qPCR,  (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) widely used in molecular biology to monitor the amplification of DNA in real time.    We considerably shortened previous protocols, do not use any name-brand expensive re-agents for DNA extraction and purification, and increased the procedure and workflow to segue easily from raw sample to qPCR assays,  says Orlofsky.  While detection in soil, water and vegetable samples was highly sensitive (as low as one cell per test), the researchers believe additional steps are required to further improve the detection levels such that they reflect low pathogen concentrations (especially ones with low infective doses) in aerosols.   The researchers recommend applying this method in the future to other pathogens such as Legionella pneumophilia, (Legionnaire s Disease),Staphylococcus aureus (Staph infection) and Campylobacter jejuni, the second most common cause of foodborne illness.

Finnish researchers found that obesity surgery and concomitant weight loss normalized brain s opioid neurotransmission, which is involved in generating pleasurable sensations. Obesity surgery provides an effective means for rapid weight loss, and the research also shows that obesity surgery also normalizes brain circuits triggering pleasurable sensations when eating. The research outcome was recently published in Molecular Psychiatry journal. ""Our findings highlight how obesity is associated with brain-level molecular changes, and how weight loss influences appetite control at the molecular level in the brain. It is possible that the lack of brain s opioid receptors predisposes the obese individuals to overeating to compensate decreased hedonic responses in this system. Obesity surgery however recovers this bias in the brain,"" says Professor Lauri Nummenmaa from Aalto University. ""Because [the] brain s opioid system recovers following weight loss, it is likely that their lower levels in the obese are due to weight gain. Altered neurotransmitter levels are thus a consequence rather than a cause of obesity. These results help us to understand the mechanisms involved in weight loss and appetite, and provide new insight into behavioral and pharmacological treatment,"" continues researcher Henry Karlsson from Turku PET Centre. Obesity is a great challenge to human health worldwide because it is associated with serious medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Obesity is also associated with alterations in the brain circuits that generate pleasurable sensations when eating, thus predisposing individuals to overeating.

That can mess with the human brain and affect the way people move and think in space. An investigation on the International Space Station seeks to understand how the brain changes in space and ways to deal with those changes. Previous research and first-hand reports suggest that humans have a harder time controlling physical movement and completing mental tasks in microgravity. Astronauts have experienced problems with balance and perceptual illusions -- feeling as if, for example, they are switching back and forth between right-side-up and upside down. The Spaceflight Effects on Neurocognitive Performance: Extent, Longevity, and Neural Bases (NeuroMapping) study is examining changes in both brain structure and function and determining how long it takes to recover after returning from space. Researchers are using both behavioral assessments and brain imaging. Astronauts complete timed obstacle courses and tests of their spatial memory, or the ability to mentally picture and manipulate a three-dimensional shape, before and after spaceflight. The spatial memory test also is performed aboard the station, along with sensory motor adaptation tests and computerized exercises requiring them to move and think simultaneously. Astronauts are tested shortly after arriving aboard the station, mid-way through and near the end of a six-month flight. Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of the brain are done pre-flight and post-flight. ""We are looking at the volume of different structures in the brain and whether they change in size or shape during spaceflight,"" said principal investigator Rachael D. Seidler, director of the University of Michigan's Neuromotor Behavior Laboratory. According to Seidler, both the behavioral assessment and brain imaging are important to help identify the relationship between physical changes in the brain and those in behavior. ""On Earth, your vestibular -- or balance -- system tells you how your head moves relative to gravity, but in space, the gravity reference is gone,"" Seidler said. ""That causes these perceptual illusions, as well as difficulty coordinating movement of the eyes and head."" These difficulties could have serious consequences for astronauts, especially when changing between gravitational environments, such as landing on Mars. In those cases, astronauts will need to be able to perform tasks such as using tools and driving a rover, and they must be capable of escape in a landing emergency. Identifying the physical mechanisms behind changes in behavior and how much time it takes to adapt will help researchers determine how best to help space explorers compensate. The study results could also reveal whether astronauts return to ""normal"" post-flight because the brain changes back, or if the brain instead learns to compensate for the changes that happened in space. Scientists know that brain changes and adaptations happen here on Earth as well. As people age, for instance, they use more brain networks than a younger person does to perform the same task. Chemotherapy, injury and illness also can trigger such adaptation. Co-investigator Patricia A. Reuter-Lorenz, chair of psychology at the University of Michigan, said a major benefit of this study is that the subjects are fit, healthy astronauts. That will make it possible to apply the findings across a range of causes. Learning more about how the human brain changes in space will help scientists better understand the ways it can recover and adapt in space, and on Earth. At least here on Earth, people can usually tell which way is up. NASA/Johnson Space Center   Original reporting by: Melissa Gaskill","Published: October 13, 2015"

Researchers at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center say their computer program determines how specific regions of the brain respond to auditory stimulus tests that hearing-impaired infants and toddlers receive before surgical implantation. With additional research and development, the authors suggest their computer model could become a practical tool that allows clinicians to more effectively screen patients with sensori-neural hearing loss before surgery. This could reduce the number of children who undergo the invasive and costly procedure, only to be disappointed when implants do not deliver hoped-for results. ""This study identifies two features from our computer analysis that are potential biomarkers for predicting cochlear implant outcomes,"" says Long (Jason) Lu, PhD, a researcher in the Division of Biomedical Informatics at Cincinnati Children's. ""We have developed one of the first successful methods for translating research data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of hearing-impaired children into something with potential for practical clinical use with individual patients."" When analyzing results from pre-surgical auditory tests, the researchers identified elevated activity in two regions of the brain that effectively predict which children benefit most from implants, making them possible biomarkers. One is in the speech-recognition and language-association areas of the brain's left hemisphere, in the superior and middle temporal gyri. The second is in the brain's right cerebellar structures. The authors say the second finding is surprising and may provide new insights about neural circuitry that supports language and auditory development in the brain. Lu's laboratory focuses on designing computer algorithms that interpret structural and functional MRIs of the human brain. His team uses this information to identify image biomarkers that can improve diagnosis and treatment options for children with brain and related neurological disorders. Along with Scott Holland, PhD, a scientist in the Pediatric Neuroimaging Consortium at Cincinnati Children's, and other collaborators from Cincinnati Children's and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, the researchers were able to blend human biology and computer technology in their current study. The mix produced a model in which computers learn how to extract and interpret data from pre-surgery functional MRIs that measure blood flow in infant brains during auditory tests. After data is collected from the functional MRIs, the computer algorithm uses a process called Bag-of-Words to project the functional MRIs to vectors, which were subsequently used to predict which children are good candidates for cochlear implants. The study included 44 infants and toddlers between the ages of 8 months and 67 months. Twenty-three of the children were hearing impaired and underwent auditory exams and functional MRIs prior to cochlear implant surgery. Twenty-one children had normal hearing and participated in the study as control subjects, undergoing standardized hearing, speech and cognition tests. Two years following cochlear implant surgery, the language performance was measured for the cochlear implant recipients, which was used as the gold standard benchmark for the computational analysis. The authors report that they tested two types of auditory stimuli during pre-surgical tests that are designed to stimulate blood flow and related activity in different areas of the brain. The stimuli included natural language speech and narrow-band noise tones. After analyzing functional MRI data from pre-surgery auditory tests and the two-year, post-surgery language tests, the researchers determined that the brain activation patterns stimulated by natural language speech have greater predictive ability.

The discovery, they say, offers clues about how flies, and probably other creatures, navigate complex environments and use odors to guide important behavioral decisions.  We didn t know flies could rapidly deposit pheromones in response to odors, but now we have evidence that that s the case with at least three such food odors,  says Christopher Potter, Ph.D., assistant professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Specifically, he says, experiments by him and his colleagues show that the pheromone known as 9-tricosene  flags a location as an ideal place for flies to mate, settle down and have kids, so to speak. It s a way to help them associate mating with a food source that will give their offspring a good start in life.  According to Potter, the pheromone s role was discovered serendipitously by graduate student Chun-Chieh Lin, who was testing a new experimental setup for use in other fly research. The setup involved placing flies in an enclosure shaped like a square that s been  pinched  on the sides, forming four pointed quadrants, with a glass top and bottom. The enclosure is kept dark but is bathed in infrared light, which reflects off the fly bodies and allows their movements to be tracked by a special camera. Lin infused apple cider vinegar fumes, which flies  love,  he says, into one quadrant and confirmed that they were attracted to it. He then switched off the odor infusion and switched on  clean air.   Much to our surprise, we found that the flies were still attracted to the quadrant that previously contained the apple cider vinegar odor,  says Lin. The smell of apple cider vinegar attracts fruit flies to the upper right quadrant of this experimental enclosure. Credit: Chun-Chieh Lin, Johns Hopkins Medicine  Knowing that flies can use pheromones to encourage grouping and aid the search for mates, the team suspected that the flies were laying down a pheromone on the glass plate. To figure out if that was the case, along with what was inducing the flies to release the pheromone, the researchers tested a variety of other substances known to get flies to get together. Only food odors, like banana and yeast paste, got the flies to come together after the odor had been replaced with clean air. The team then tested different combinations of flies during the apple cider vinegar phase and the clean air phase, and found that males alone were the ones depositing the pheromone, and that it was attractive to both males and females. To learn whether the flies were indeed smelling the pheromone or just tasting it, the researchers used a series of mutant flies that lacked one set of sensory detectors   taste or smell   or the other. It turned out that the fruit flies  aggregation behavior depended on their sense of smell. Potter says identifying the specific pheromone itself was  a bit trickier,  but the team relied on what was known about pheromones generally and guessed that they could dissolve it off the plates using a solvent called hexane. The researchers then made sure that the hexane wash contained the pheromone by painting an E on the bottom of the enclosure with it and watching the flies  behavior. They then captured on video (below) the flies recreating the E by spending more time along that letter-shaped  paint  than anywhere else in their enclosure. Potter says that a recent study showed that male fruit flies make four different airborne pheromones whose chemical makeup dissolves in hexane. To pinpoint which one was responsible for the phenomenon they were seeing, the research team used a technology called gas chromatography mass spectrometry to figure out the molecular makeup of the hexane wash. The result was 9-tricosene, whose fruit fly function was unknown at the time. But when they painted 9-tricosene in an E shape on the enclosure s floor, the flies aggregated in a similarly patterned way to what the researchers had seen with the hexane wash. Intrigued by the finding, Potter says, the research team wondered if 9-tricosene could be stimulating more than just fly get-togethers, since other critical behaviors   such as courtship and egg laying   also occur at food sources. To find out, the researchers modified their fly enclosure slightly by adding a thin layer of gel to the bottom so that females could lay eggs. After males laid down 9-tricosene in response to food odors, females laid five times more eggs in the same quadrant. Further experiments found that 9-tricosene activates the receptor protein Or7a that is found on about 20 olfactory (smell) neurons in the fly s antennae.  The activated receptor sends a signal to the brain, which can trigger behavioral responses,  says Potter.  What s interesting is that these olfactory neurons, because of where they are found on the fly s  nose,  were previously considered unlikely suspects to respond to pheromones, so this finding opens up a whole new set of questions about how animals behave and react to their environments.  One potentially practical application of its findings, the team says, depends on whether mosquitoes use a similar type of odorant signaling. If so, Potter says, it s possible that the mosquito-borne disease malaria could be fought by exploiting pheromone signals to decrease the number of mosquitoes in affected areas. Johns Hopkins Medicine   press release Potter CJ et al. Food odors trigger Drosophila males to deposit a pheromone that guides aggregation and female oviposition decisions.  eLife, Published September 30 2015. doi: 10.7554/eLife.08688","Published: October 13, 2015"

The two companies are known for their best-in-class prediction tools for selection and optimisation of potential therapeutics, where it is essential to recognise and resolve potential problems as early as possible. Computer software for  virtual design  of drug candidate molecules prior to synthesis and testing is ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry and an important time-saver in research. As part of the agreement, both companies will exchange their proprietary technologies; the first phase will incorporate a suite of high-quality predictive models of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) and physicochemical properties from Optibrium's StarDrop  platform as an optional feature within BioSolveIT's SeeSAR  package. This will be followed by the integration of SeeSAR's capabilities to work with 3D structural information into StarDrop's unique environment that guides the design of high quality compounds. Dr. Matt Segall, CEO of Optibrium, commented:  Our customers tell us that they want to understand the relationship between the SAR in their data and the 3D structures of their compounds and protein targets. BioSolveIT's state-of-the-art and scientifically rigorous approach is unparalleled when it comes to visualising and predicting 3D binding - it was an obvious first choice to work with them. There is great synergy between our platforms' capabilities that needs seamless integration to provide the most value. The strongest binding molecule is of no use if it doesn't achieve sufficient exposure in a patient. Therefore, the discovery of a new drug is a multi-faceted optimisation challenge. The adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) behaviour, as well as the toxicity of compounds need to be always at the forefront of drug discovery - alongside target inhibition.  BioSolveIT's Director of Application Science, Dr. Marcus Gastreich, said:  Having an integrated solution for the researcher is like a head-up display: The impact of easy-to-use software accompanying the research process must be non-obstructive but always there: All parameters nicely organised, plus a powerful and minimalistic alerting system are the keys to avoid costly failure.  Dr. Christian Lemmen, CEO of BioSolveIT, said:  Both companies share a passion for intuitive and clean user interfaces - an aspect which is widely neglected in scientific software. Management has realised that users need easily accessible functionality besides scientific value in software. For both, we are proud to have Optibrium as a like-minded partner, their ADME property predictions are highly regarded by the industry.  Optibrium is a world leader in the prediction of compound properties, such as solubility, metabolism, or penetration of the blood-brain-barrier, and the use of these predictions alongside experimental data to guide the selection and design of high quality compounds. Optibrium's StarDrop platform includes ground-breaking features, such as Card View , which provides researchers with highly intuitive ways to explore the structure-activity relationships (SAR) in their data and identify new strategies for optimisation. BioSolveIT is renowned for their extreme speed and accuracy in predicting  inhibition  in 3D - the strength of lock and key-like binding of candidate molecules in their target proteins; their radically simple and visual tools such as SeeSAR and LeadIT  are used worldwide by big pharma and biotech companies.

A relatively recent addition to the university, Park is a  top-talent  educator who was recruited for her leadership in a  high-impact, high-demand area  in which the university wants to continue to position itself as a global leader. The area in which Park has established herself as an expert is the field of study related to the creation and monitoring of delivery vehicles that carry medicine to specific locations within the body.Park was first inspired to pursue this course of study when she saw the side effects of cancer and how the drugs used to kill cancer cells also killed other parts of the body. Regarding chemotherapy she explains,  If you inject the drug intravenously it can go anywhere and everywhere, which is why we get side effects like hair loss.  She hoped to find a way of sending drugs only to the specific area of the body that needed the treatment rather than inadvertently treating (and harming) the whole body. In doing this, the medical treatment would be more effective and the patient could remain stronger during treatment. Describing her work she says,  Usually I use nanoparticles for drug delivery vehicles, and we can attach image and contrast agents to the nanoparticle [to track the particle]. Or the nanoparticle itself is the image and contrast agent which makes a complex of the image and contrast agent with the drug itself.  In the course of time Park began to focus her efforts on those parts of the body that posed a significant challenge or risk to doctors who are trying to reach that locale with medicine. Two areas that have been of particular interest to her are spinal discs and places within the eyeball, both of which can be painful and risky to access with traditional methods. Since April, Park has been working with James Lin, director of the Skeletal Tissue Evaluation and Engineering Laboratory, to specifically focus on the regeneration of spinal disc degeneration. So far the two have been making great strides.  While we are aging, the discs between the bones are wearing out so severely that some patients feel extreme pain, however addressing this pain is challenging,  explains Professor Park. Using vehicles made with perfluorocarbons, Park and Lin have created bio-safe, durable, reliable vehicles that can be inserted into the discs and traced via medical imaging. Lin says that these vehicles, described as  droplets,  enter the bloodstream and are tracked  without opening up the body  to provide real time feedback and manipulation. Park says,  We can see the dosage in our bodies and we can see the drug bio-distribution. So we can minimize the side effects before something happens.  The drug delivery systems Park and Lin have designed can be filled with the prescribed drug and inserted a single time into the spinal disc. Then, using a precisely calibrated ultrasound, the vehicles can be  popped  to systematically release the drug as needed. This technique allows for minimized invasive treatment, thus reducing the risk of harmful side effects, as well as creating a delivery system that can potentially be self-administered by the patient.Lin says that his favorite part of his collaboration with Park has been that studying this drug delivery system has much wider applications and  the potential gives you an additional opportunity to make entire body repair schemes.  In fact, he relates that using the ultrasound technique to burst microbubbles has been used to break up blood clots that might otherwise have led to strokes. Preliminary testing of the drug delivery procedure is being performed at the Laboratory Animal Medical Services (LAMS) facility on UC s East Campus. Currently Park is in the preclinical phase, which she and Lin hope will lead to enough evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of the treatment to convince the FDA to allow them to move to clinical trials. Because this is a new application for an old drug, the two expect less challenges from the FDA than if they were trying to introduce an entirely new drug to the market. Thankfully UC provides all of the necessary facilities, equipment, and resources for Park to pursue her research in tandem to her responsibilities as a professor. In fact, it was the superb medical facilities she would have access to as a professor at UC that aided in her decision to accept the position at the university. At the University of Cincinnati, Park is certain she will be able to go far in her research.  Many people have been trying,  says Park of her attempt to create an effective drug delivery vehicle, and she herself is no stranger to this work, having spent a decade focusing on issues related to this project. Her PhD at Purdue University and her research at Boston s Massachusetts Institute of Technology were both dedicated to studying particle stabilization to avoid clogging arteries with the nanoparticles and drug delivery vehicles; creating a vehicle that could be programmed to travel to specific destinations; tracking this vehicle with medical imaging; and learning how drugs could be time-released at the proper time.","Published: October 13, 2015"

This approach is only made possible by contrasting the DNA of children with severe developmental disorders of unknown genetic cause, with the DNA from individuals without overt developmental disorders. These research participants were drawn from around the globe. There are over 1,000 different genetic causes of developmental disorders that have already been identified, but these only account for about one third of all children with such disorders.Most individual developmental disorders are so rare that they confound efforts to uncover their causes, hence the importance of taking a nationwide approach.In the study the DDD team analysed samples from more than 4,000 families from across the UK and Republic of Ireland with at least one child affected by a developmental disorder and applied a computational strategy to identify clusters of affected children that had similar clinical characteristics and shared damaging genetic variants in the same gene. Comparing the variants observed in these genes in the affected children with genetic variation observed in over 60,000 research participants - who have agreed to share their genetic data to support medical research - allowed the team to identify four previously uncharacterised genetic disorders. The power of the study is built on the contribution of many thousands of people who have agreed to share genetic data to support medical research, and the work of the Exome Aggregation consortium (ExAC) in bringing those data together and making them available widely. ""With the contribution of many thousands of people to medical research, we have the power to uncover mutations behind some devastating conditions,"" says Dr Matthew Hurles, project leader at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. ""Their altruism can unlock the secrets in our genomes, providing answers to families desperate to understand their child's condition and enabling those families to access support and engage in further studies researching possible therapeutic strategies."" The DDD team focused on genetic disorders where a child inherits a damaged copy of a gene from both parents, neither of whom have the disorder because they also carry an undamaged 'back-up' copy of the gene. Defining genetic variants that cause such rare disorders has previously most often relied on studies of extensive family trees, where several people are affected with the same disorder, or of studies of unrelated individuals sharing the same, very distinctive, disorder. For many developmental disorders, these requirements are not met. The team screened genes encoding over 18,000 proteins in the families' genomes, searching for variants that might prevent each protein from working, and uncovered 74 genes in which mutations might play a role. For four of these genes, comparisons with the ExAC dataset revealed that these damaging variants were greatly enriched in the affected children compared to individuals without developmental disorders. The children's conditions were systematically clinically assessed to objectively characterise the disorder. This systematic assessment was essential for large-scale computational analysis. ""It is only by combining large datasets with computational analysis and systematic description of the clinical conditions that we can identify these causative variants,"" says Professor David FitzPatrick from the MRC Human Genetics Unit at the University of Edinburgh. ""The distinctiveness of both genotype and phenotype was used to discover rare recessive disorders. The genotype score was especially useful for those with less specific clinical presentations. The combined score identified ultra-rare but clinically-recognisable syndromes,"" ""This doesn't bring new treatments but, without knowing the underlying genetic cause, we don't even know where to start that search. A genetic diagnosis helps families in their understanding of their child's disorder, can help them to access other support and allow them to engage in further studies researching possible therapeutic strategies."" The damaging variants in children with developmental disorders affected genes involved in brain development, configuring of the heart and other organs in early embryonic development, and bone growth. For each of the four new disorders, additional support came from observing that mice having a mutation in the equivalent gene shared many characteristics that resembled the human condition. ""New strategies for discovering the genetic causes of rare disease are desperately needed,"" says Dr Daniel MacArthur, Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School and the coordinator of the ExAC project, who was not involved in the study. ""This study shows the value of clever analysis methods, together with genetic data from populations around the world from the ExAC project, to find answers for rare disease families.""","Published: October 13, 2015"

By adding different concentrations of growth factors at various times, researchers were able to guide the formation of the mini organ in a process that mimicked normal development. The mini-kidney the team produced is similar to the kidney of embryo developing foetus. Researchers say the advancement will also mean they can now tweak this process to optimise the amount of each cell type present.The breakthrough could allow the use of mini-organs to screen drugs either for the treatment of kidney disease or to find out if a new drug is likely to injure the kidney.  The mini-kidney we have been able to grow is very complex and more like the real organ. This is important for drug testing as we hope they will respond to the drugs as a normal organ might,  Professor Little said.   Creating a model kidney containing many different kidney cell types also opens the door for cell therapy and even bioengineering of replacement kidneys. One day this may mean new treatments for patients with kidney failure.  Importantly, the new method means researchers can make a miniature model kidney from any person, starting with cells such as skin or blood.  Making stem cells from patients with kidney disease, and then growing a mini-kidney that matches the patient, will help us understand that patient s disease and develop treatments for them . The finding will also allow researchers to learn more about how the human kidney forms normally.","Published: October 13, 2015"

The simulations also show the dynamic nature of DNA, which constantly wiggles and morphs into different shapes   a far cry from the commonly held idea of a rigid and static double helix structure. Improving our understanding of what DNA looks like when it is in the cell will help us to design better medicines, such as new antibiotics or more effective cancer chemotherapies. Dr Sarah Harris from the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leeds, who led the computer simulation research side of the study, said:  This is because the action of drug molecules relies on them recognising a specific molecular shape   much like a key fits a particular lock. The double helix shape has a firm place in the public's collective consciousness. It is referenced in popular culture and often features in art and design. But the shape of DNA isn t always that simple. Dr Harris said:  When Watson and Crick described the DNA double helix, they were looking at a tiny part of a real genome, only about one turn of the double helix. This is about 12 DNA  base pairs , which are the building blocks of DNA that form the rungs of the helical ladder.  Our study looks at DNA on a somewhat grander scale   several hundreds of base pairs   and even this relatively modest increase in size reveals a whole new richness in the behavior of the DNA molecule.  There are actually about 3 billion base pairs that make up the complete set of DNA instructions in humans. This is about a metre of DNA. This enormous string of molecular information has to be precisely organised by coiling it up tightly so that it can be squeezed into the nucleus of cells. To study the structure of DNA when it is crammed into cells, the researchers needed to replicate this coiling of DNA. Dr Lynn Zechiedrich, the corresponding author for the study from the Baylor College of Medicine, said:  You can't coil linear DNA and study it, so we had to make circles so the ends would trap the different degrees of winding.  To investigate how the winding changed what the circles looked like, the researchers wound and then unwound the tiny DNA circles   10 million times shorter in length than the DNA contained within our cells   a single turn at a time. The researchers devised a test to make sure that the tiny twisted up DNA circles that they made in the laboratory acted in the same way as the full-length DNA strands within our cells, when it is referred to as  biologically active . They used an enzyme called  human topoisomerase II alpha  that manipulates the twist of DNA. The test showed that the enzyme relieved the winding stress from all of the supercoiled circles, even the most coiled ones, which is its normal job in the human body. This result means that the DNA in the circles must look and act like the much longer DNA that the enzyme encounters in human cells. Dr Rossitza Irobalieva, the co-lead author on the publication, who conducted the work while she was at Baylor, used  cryo-electron tomography    a powerful microscopy technique that involves freezing biologically active material   to provide the first three-dimensional images of individual circular DNA molecules. She saw that coiling the tiny DNA circles caused them to form a zoo of beautiful and unexpected shapes.  Some of the circles had sharp bends, some were figure-8s, and others looked like handcuffs or racquets or even sewing needles. Some looked like rods because they were so coiled,  said Dr Irobalieva. The static images produced by the cryo-electron tomography were then compared to and matched with shapes generated in supercomputer simulations that were run at the University of Leeds. These simulated images provided a higher-resolution view of the DNA and show how its dynamic motion makes its shape constantly change to form a myriad of structures. The cryo-electron tomography of the tiny DNA circles also revealed another surprise finding. Base pairs in DNA are like a genetic alphabet, in which the letters on one side of the DNA double helix only pair with a particular letter on the other side. While the researchers expected to see the opening of base pairs   that is, the separation of the paired letters in the genetic alphabet   when the DNA was under-wound, they were surprised to see this opening for the over-wound DNA. This is because over-winding is supposed to make the DNA double helix stronger. The researchers hypothesise that this disruption of base pairs may cause flexible hinges, allowing the DNA to bend sharply, perhaps helping to explain how a meter of DNA can be jammed into a single human cell. Dr Harris concludes:  We are sure that supercomputers will play an increasingly important role in drug design. We are trying to do a puzzle with millions of pieces, and they all keep changing shape.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/analyzing-protein-structures-in-their-native-environment-186462,Analyzing Protein Structures in Their Native Environment Enhanced sensitivity NMR could reveal new clues to how proteins fold   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Proteins can fold in different ways depending on their environment. These different configurations change the function of the protein; misfolding is frequently associated with diseases such as Alzheimer s and Parkinson s. Until now, it has been difficult to fully characterize the different structures that proteins can take on in their natural environments. However, using a new technique known as sensitivity-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), MIT researchers have shown that they can analyze the structure that a yeast protein forms as it interacts with other proteins in a cell. Using this type of NMR, which is based on a technique known as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), scientists can gain much more insight into protein structure and function than is possible with current NMR technology, which requires large quantities of purified proteins, isolated from their usual environment.  Dynamic nuclear polarization has a capacity to transform our understanding of biological structures in their native contexts,  says Susan Lindquist, a professor of biology at MIT, member of the Whitehead Institute, and one of the senior authors of the paper. Robert Griffin, an MIT professor of chemistry and director of the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory, is also a senior author of the paper. Kendra Frederick, a former Whitehead postdoc who is now an assistant professor at the University of Texas Southwestern, is the paper s lead author. DNP-enhanced sensitivity Traditional NMR uses the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei to reveal the structures of the molecules containing those nuclei. By using a strong magnetic field that interacts with the nuclear spins of carbon atoms in the proteins, NMR measures a trait known as chemical shift for some of the individual atoms in the sample, which can reveal how those atoms are connected.  You look at changes in chemical shift and that tells you, for example, if there is an alpha helix or a beta sheet, which are two different conformations that a protein backbone often takes,  Frederick says. However, traditional NMR is not very sensitive, because it only allows you to obtain information from the carbon-13 nuclei in a sample, which occur at 0.1 percent natural abundance. For the past 20 years, Griffin s lab has been developing dynamic nuclear polarization, which requires transferring polarization from unpaired electrons to protons and then carbon nuclei, using microwaves generated by a gyrotron, a high-frequency microwave oscillator developed in collaboration with Richard Temkin of MIT s Department of Physics and Plasma Science and Fusion Center. In addition, Tim Swager and his group in the MIT Department of Chemistry have developed paramagnetic polarizing agents for the experiments. This allows researchers to boost signal intensities in carbon-13 NMR spectra by factors of 100 to 400, a very significant increase in sensitivity. With traditional solid-state NMR, about 30 milligrams of purified protein are needed to get information within a reasonable amount of time. But with the boost in sensitivity from DNP, the protein no longer needs to be purified, and it can be analyzed in quantities that would normally be found inside a cell.  It s opening up a completely new set of problems that we can access,  Frederick says.  Using the sensitivity enhancement technique allows you to look at the protein at the correct levels, which is really important when you re thinking about its biology.  To make sure they are getting data only on the protein of interest, the researchers label their target protein with carbon-13   a stable isotope of carbon   while the rest of the proteins are unlabeled.  This technique has the potential to really open up a wide range of studies, under physiological conditions, that no one has been able to do before,  says Tim Cross, director of the NMR program at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and a professor at Florida State University.  You don t have to crystallize the proteins, you don t have to put them into a uniform solution. You can study them in their natural environment, and that s tremendously exciting,  says Cross, who was not part of the research team. Protein folding In the Cell paper, the researchers analyzed a yeast protein called Sup35, which Lindquist s lab has been studying for many years. Sup35 is a prion   a type of protein that can form tangled clumps known as amyloids. Its usual function is to help cells terminate protein translation, but when it takes on an amyloid structure, it stops performing that function. These are both normal states for the yeast protein, but when human proteins form amyloids they are usually associated with diseases   especially neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s, Parkinson s, and Huntington s, as well as rheumatoid arthritis. In previous studies using traditional NMR with purified Sup35 protein, scientists have found that a large section of the protein, which forms the amyloid, has a beta-sheet structure, which resembles the folds of an accordion. Another large section is intrinsically disordered and tends to flop around instead of forming a consistent structure. However, in the new study, when the researchers looked at Sup35 surrounded by other cellular proteins, they found that the intrinsically disordered region actually does take on a regular structure, which they believe to be beta sheets. However, more powerful resolution is needed to tell for sure, Frederick says. Frederick plans to continue using this NMR technique to study other yeast proteins, as well as human amyloid proteins. In particular, she wants to study why proteins can take on different conformations in different types of cells, or cells from people with different genetic backgrounds.","Published: October 13, 2015"

It has been described as a  silent killer  because most people are unaware of having the condition, which is one that puts them at greater risk of heart disease. The findings are the latest to emerge from the internationally renowned Dunedin Study, which has tracked more than a 1000 people born in Dunedin in 1972-3 from birth to the present.  Using blood pressure information collected between the ages of 7 to 38 years, researchers identified study members as belonging to one of four different blood pressure groups. They found that more than a third of them were at risk of developing clinically high blood pressure levels by early mid-life. Lead author Dr Reremoana Theodore says she and her colleagues were also able to identify a number of factors in early life that increased the odds of being in a high risk blood pressure group.  These included being male, having a family history of high blood pressure, being first born and being born lower birthweight. This new information is useful for screening purposes to help clinicians identify young people who may develop high blood pressure later in adulthood,  Dr Theodore says. The study also showed that having a higher body mass index (a measure of overweight and obesity) and cigarette smoking over time were associated with increasing blood pressure levels over time, especially for individuals in the higher blood pressure groups. Dunedin Study Director, Professor Richie Poulton, says  encouraging lifestyle changes beginning early in life that include the maintenance of a healthy body weight, weight reduction and stopping smoking may help to lower blood pressure levels over time, particularly among those individuals on a trajectory to developing hypertension . Those individuals in the higher blood pressure groups were also more likely to have other negative health related conditions by age 38 years including higher blood cholesterol levels.  Our findings can be used to inform early detection, targeted prevention and/or intervention to help reduce the burden associated with this silent killer,  Dr Theodore says.","Published: October 13, 2015"

Currently, there are no safe or effective therapies for lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. Cholesterol-lowering medications have had limited success in reducing the progression of the disease and the eventual need for liver transplant. A total of 66 patients were enrolled in the multi-center study, which was designed and supported by Synageva BioPharma, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures the drug. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either sebelipase alfa or a placebo for 20 weeks before entering the open-label period. The investigators evaluated the effectiveness of the therapy through the normalization of the alanine aminotransferase level (ALT), a test used to detect liver damage. They also looked at other disease-related symptoms and possible side effects.

According to Professor Martin Berg , people with cancer or an elevated risk of developing the disease should avoid nutritional supplements that contain antioxidants. Researchers at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, demonstrated in January 2014 that antioxidants hastened and aggravated the progression of lung cancer. Mice that were given antioxidants developed additional and more aggressive tumors. Experiments on human lung cancer cells confirmed the results. Given well-established evidence that free radicals can cause cancer, the research community had simply assumed that antioxidants, which destroy them, provide protection against the disease. Found in many nutritional supplements, antioxidants are widely marketed as a means of preventing cancer. Because the lung cancer studies called the collective wisdom into question, they attracted a great deal of attention.Double the rate The follow-up studies at Sahlgrenska Academy have now found that antioxidants double the rate of metastasis in malignant melanoma, the most perilous type of skin cancer.  ""As opposed to the lung cancer studies, the primary melanoma tumor was not affected,"" Professor Berg  says. ""But the antioxidant boosted the ability of the tumor cells to metastasize, an even more serious problem because metastasis is the cause of death in the case of melanoma. The primary tumor is not dangerous per se and is usually removed."" Confirmed the results Experiments on cell cultures from patients with malignant melanoma confirmed the new results. ""We have demonstrated that antioxidants promote the progression of cancer in at least two different ways,"" Professor Berg  says. The overall conclusion from the various studies is that antioxidants protect healthy cells from free radicals that can turn them into malignancies but may also protect a tumor once it has developed. Avoid supplements Taking nutritional supplements containing antioxidants may unintentionally hasten the progression of a small tumor or premalignant lesion, neither of which is possible to detect. ""Previous research at Sahlgrenska Academy has indicated that cancer patients are particularly prone to take supplements containing antioxidants,"" Dr. Berg  says. Our current research combined with information from large clinical trials with antioxidants suggests that people who have been recently diagnosed with cancer should avoid such supplements."" High mortality rate One of the fastest expanding types of cancer in the developed world, malignant melanoma has a high mortality rate - which is one reason that researchers at Sahlgrenska Academy were so anxious to follow up on the lung cancer studies. ""Identifying factors that affect the progression of malignant melanoma is a crucial task,"" Professor Berg  says. Lotions next The role of antioxidants is particularly relevant in the case of melanoma, not only because melanoma cells are known to be sensitive to free radicals but because the cells can be exposed to antioxidants by non-dietary means as well. ""Skin and suntan lotions sometimes contain beta carotene or vitamin E, both of which could potentially affect malignant melanoma cells in the same way as antioxidants in nutritional supplements,"" Professor Berg  says. Other forms of cancer How antioxidants in lotions affect the course of malignant melanoma is currently being explored. ""We are testing whether antioxidants applied directly to malignant melanoma cells in mice hasten the progression of cancer in the same way as their dietary counterparts,"" Professor Berg  says. He stresses that additional research is badly needed. ""Granted that lung cancer is the most common form of the disease and melanoma is expanding fastest, other forms of cancer and types of antioxidants need to be considered if we want to make a fully informed assessment of the role that free radicals and antioxidants play in the process of cancer progression.""","Published: October 13, 2015"

But now in a landmark study by George Church, Ph.D., and his team at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University and Harvard Medical School, the gene editing system known as ""CRISPR Cas9"" has been used to genetically engineer pig DNA in 62 locations   an explosive leap forward in CRISPR's capability when compared to its previous record maximum of just six simultaneous edits. The 62 edits were executed by the team to inactivate retroviruses found natively in the pig genome that have so far inhibited pig organs from being suitable for transplant in human patients. With the retroviruses safely removed via genetic engineering, however, the road is now open toward the possibility that humans could one day receive life saving organ transplants from pigs. Church is a Wyss Core Faculty member, the Robert Winthrop Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Professor of Health Sciences and Technology at Harvard and MIT. The advance, reported by Church and his team including the study's lead author Luhan Yang, Ph.D., a Postdoctoral Fellow at HMS and the Wyss Institute, was published earlier this month.The concept of xenotransplantation, which is the transplant of an organ from one species to another, is nothing new. Researchers and clinicians have long hoped that one of the major challenges facing patients suffering from organ failure   which is the lack of available organs in the United States and worldwide   could be alleviated through the availability of suitable animal organs for transplant. Pigs in particular have been especially promising candidates due to their similar size and physiology to humans. In fact, pig heart valves are already commonly sterilized and de cellularized for use repairing or replacing human heart valves. But the transplant of whole, functional organs comprised of living cells and tissue constructs has presented a unique set of challenges for scientists. One of the primary problems has been the fact that most mammals including pigs contain repetitive, latent retrovirus fragments in their genomes   present in all their living cells   that are harmless to their native hosts but can cause disease in other species.  ""The presence of this type of virus found in pigs   known as porcine endogenous retroviruses or PERVs   brought over a billion of dollars of pharmaceutical industry investments into developing xenotransplant methods to a standstill by the early 2000s,"" said Church. ""PERVs and the lack of ability to remove them from pig DNA was a real showstopper on what had been a promising stage set for xenotransplantation."" Now   using CRISPR Cas9 like a pair of molecular scissors   Church and his team have inactivated all 62 repetitive genes containing a PERV in pig DNA, surpassing a significant obstacle on the path to bringing xenotransplantation to clinical reality. With more than 120,000 patients currently in the United States awaiting transplant and less than 30,000 transplants on average occurring annually, xenotransplantation could give patients and clinicians an alternative in the future. ""Pig kidneys can already function experimentally for months in baboons, but concern about the potential risks of PERVs has posed a problem for the field of xenotransplantation for many years,"" said David H. Sachs, M.D., Director of the TBRC Laboratories at Massachusetts General Hospital, Paul S. Russell Professor of Surgery Emeritus at Harvard Medical School, and Professor of Surgical Sciences at Columbia University's Center for Translational Immunology. Sachs has been developing special pigs for xenotransplantation for more than 30 years and is currently collaborating with Church on further genetic modifications of his pigs. ""If Church and his team are able to produce pigs from genetically engineered embryos lacking PERVs by the use of CRISPR-Cas9, they would eliminate an important potential safety concern facing this field."" Yang says the team hopes eventually they can completely eliminate the risk that PERVs could cause disease in clinical xenotransplantation by using modified pig cells to clone a line of pigs that would have their PERV genes inactivated. ""This advance overcomes a major hurdle that has until now halted the progress of xenotransplantation research and development,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. ""The real value and potential impact is in the number of lives that could be saved if we can one day use xenotransplants to close the huge gap between the number of available functional organs and the number of people who desperately need them."" The remarkable and newly demonstrated capability for CRISPR to edit tens of repetitive genes such as PERVs will also unlock new ways for scientists to study and understand repetitive regions in the genome, which has been estimated to comprise more than two thirds of our own human genome.","Published: October 13, 2015"

The discovery, they say, offers clues about how flies, and probably other creatures, navigate complex environments and use odors to guide important behavioral decisions. ""We didn't know flies could rapidly deposit pheromones in response to odors, but now we have evidence that that's the case with at least three such food odors,"" says Christopher Potter, Ph.D., assistant professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Specifically, he says, experiments by him and his colleagues show that the pheromone known as 9-tricosene ""flags a location as an ideal place for flies to mate, settle down and have kids, so to speak. It's a way to help them associate mating with a food source that will give their offspring a good start in life.""According to Potter, the pheromone's role was discovered serendipitously by graduate student Chun-Chieh Lin, who was testing a new experimental setup for use in other fly research. The setup involved placing flies in an enclosure shaped like a square that's been ""pinched"" on the sides, forming four pointed quadrants, with a glass top and bottom. The enclosure is kept dark but is bathed in infrared light, which reflects off the fly bodies and allows their movements to be tracked by a special camera. Lin infused apple cider vinegar fumes, which flies ""love,"" he says, into one quadrant and confirmed that they were attracted to it. He then switched off the odor infusion and switched on ""clean air."" ""Much to our surprise, we found that the flies were still attracted to the quadrant that previously contained the apple cider vinegar odor,"" says Lin. Knowing that flies can use pheromones to encourage grouping and aid the search for mates, the team suspected that the flies were laying down a pheromone on the glass plate. To figure out if that was the case, along with what was inducing the flies to release the pheromone, the researchers tested a variety of other substances known to get flies to get together. Only food odors, like banana and yeast paste, got the flies to come together after the odor had been replaced with clean air. The team then tested different combinations of flies during the apple cider vinegar phase and the clean air phase, and found that males alone were the ones depositing the pheromone, and that it was attractive to both males and females. To learn whether the flies were indeed smelling the pheromone or just tasting it, the researchers used a series of mutant flies that lacked one set of sensory detectors -- taste or smell -- or the other. It turned out that the fruit flies' aggregation behavior depended on their sense of smell. Potter says identifying the specific pheromone itself was ""a bit trickier,"" but the team relied on what was known about pheromones generally and guessed that they could dissolve it off the plates using a solvent called hexane. The researchers then made sure that the hexane wash contained the pheromone by painting an E on the bottom of the enclosure with it and watching the flies' behavior. They then captured on video the flies recreating the E by spending more time along that letter-shaped ""paint"" than anywhere else in their enclosure. Potter says that a recent study showed that male fruit flies make four different airborne pheromones whose chemical makeup dissolves in hexane. To pinpoint which one was responsible for the phenomenon they were seeing, the research team used a technology called gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to figure out the molecular makeup of the hexane wash. The result was 9-tricosene, whose fruit fly function was unknown at the time. But when they painted 9-tricosene in an E shape on the enclosure's floor, the flies aggregated in a similarly patterned way to what the researchers had seen with the hexane wash. Intrigued by the finding, Potter says, the research team wondered if 9-tricosene could be stimulating more than just fly get-togethers, since other critical behaviors -- such as courtship and egg laying -- also occur at food sources. To find out, the researchers modified their fly enclosure slightly by adding a thin layer of gel to the bottom so that females could lay eggs. After males laid down 9-tricosene in response to food odors, females laid five times more eggs in the same quadrant. Further experiments found that 9-tricosene activates the receptor protein Or7a that is found on about 20 olfactory (smell) neurons in the fly's antennae. ""The activated receptor sends a signal to the brain, which can trigger behavioral responses,"" says Potter. ""What's interesting is that these olfactory neurons, because of where they are found on the fly's 'nose,' were previously considered unlikely suspects to respond to pheromones, so this finding opens up a whole new set of questions about how animals behave and react to their environments."" One potentially practical application of its findings, the team says, depends on whether mosquitoes use a similar type of odorant signaling. If so, Potter says, it's possible that the mosquito-borne disease malaria could be fought by exploiting pheromone signals to decrease the number of mosquitoes in affected areas.","Published: October 13, 2015"

This finding by researchers at Columbia University Medical Center, New York State Psychiatric Institute, the Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, and New York University is published in Nature Neuroscience. Anorexia nervosa is a serious and puzzling illness. Even as its clinical signs have become increasingly recognized, the mortality rate remains among the highest of any psychiatric disorder. A highly stereotyped feature of this illness is the persistent selection of low-calorie, low-fat food, despite the individual's desire for change. The brain mechanisms underlying this persistent and restrictive eating disorder are unclear. The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging, tracking brain activity in real time, to monitor 21 women with anorexia nervosa and 21 healthy individuals while they made a series of choices about what food to eat. As expected, individuals with anorexia nervosa consistently chose fewer high-fat foods. The brain regions they used to make those choices were also different: for individuals with anorexia nervosa, choices about what to eat were associated with activation in the dorsal striatum, a brain region known to be related to habitual control of actions. Furthermore, activation in fronto-striatal brain circuits during the experiment predicted how many calories they chose to consume in a meal the following day. These are the first data linking abnormalities in brain activity with the salient behavioral disturbance of anorexia nervosa, restrictive food choice. These findings open up entirely new avenues for treatment development and understanding of disease mechanisms. ""We are already developing a new psychotherapy intervention built on principles of habit reversal that helps patients with anorexia nervosa change maladaptive behaviors,"" says Joanna Steinglass, MD, one of the lead authors and associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center. ""As we improve our understanding of brain mechanisms, new medication targets may emerge as well."" ""This study may also help link anorexia nervosa to disorders like substance abuse, gambling and other conditions that may involve choices related to excessive activity in the dorsal striatum,"" added Daphna Shohamy, PhD, author and associate professor of psychology and principal investigator at Columbia University's Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute. ""There is tremendous value in studying how the brain makes decisions in both health and disease.

The findings show how a nanoscale, synthetic  diamond  can light up early-stage cancers in MRI scans Physicists from the University of Sydney have devised a way to use diamonds to identify cancerous tumours before they become life threatening. Their findings reveal how a nano-scale, synthetic version of the precious gem can light up early-stage cancers in non-toxic, non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans.Targeting cancers with tailored chemicals is not new but scientists struggle to detect where these chemicals go since, short of a biopsy, there are few ways to see if a treatment has been taken-up by a cancer. Led by Professor David Reilly from the School of Physics, researchers from the University investigated how nanoscale diamonds could help identify cancers in their earliest stages.  We knew nano diamonds were of interest for delivering drugs during chemotherapy because they are largely non-toxic and non-reactive,  says Professor Reilly.  We thought we could build on these non-toxic properties realising that diamonds have magnetic characteristics enabling them to act as beacons in MRIs. We effectively turned a pharmaceutical problem into a physics problem.  Professor Reilly s team turned its attention to hyperpolarising nano-diamonds, a process of aligning atoms inside a diamond so they create a signal detectable by an MRI scanner.  By attaching hyperpolarised diamonds to molecules targeting cancers the technique can allow tracking of the molecules  movement in the body,  says Ewa Rej, the paper s lead author.  This is a great example of how quantum physics research tackles real-world problems, in this case opening the way for us to image and target cancers long before they become life-threatening,  says Professor Reilly. The next stage of the team s work involves working with medical researchers to test the new technology on animals.  Also on the horizon is research using scorpion venom to target brain tumours with MRI scanning.","Published: October 12, 2015"

Instead, FUS   Fused in Sarcoma s   protein interaction region remains forever squirmy and squiggly, the study reports, performing its healthy functions by assembling into liquid-like droplets with other copies of itself and key molecules such as RNA. The findings may dash hopes that preventing FUS from causing ALS and cancer could be a typical drug development task of resolving its errant forms and then figuring out how to block them. Instead, biologists may have to understand and control variations, or codes, of amino acid sequences in the protein that apparently guide them to engage in certain kinds of assemblies and prevent droplet assemblies from turning into tangled knots. The cell, we know, organizes these structures transiently,  said study senior author Nicolas Fawzi, assistant professor of medical science in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Physiology, and Biotechnology at Brown University.  That code is malleable. If we could understand what holds these things together, we might be able to change the code on the fly the way the cell does.  Huddling up Assemblies of FUS strands, which appear under the microscope to be little droplets, rapidly form and dissipate throughout cells as needed to bind and organize RNA within the cell. For instance, one kind of assembly may form to shepherd mRNA from the nucleus to the ribosome. Another may form to capture RNA and sequester it for a time, Fawzi said. Individual FUS proteins, which are like little noodles, are found all over the place, floating in wait for the moment when they become cued into action.  The formation of these droplets of proteins and RNA together somehow seems to be important for getting RNA through its lifecycle, getting it made, getting it where it needs to be, and getting it transported and processed properly,  Fawzi said. Before this study, scientists knew the protein formed these little droplets to organize RNA and knew that sometimes FUS can go awry and become associated with disease. In the case of ALS they transform into intractable and accumulating knots. In some cancers, like leukemias and sarcomas, Fawzi said, mutated FUS proteins may form droplets in unfortunate locations, leading to misregulated genetic transcription. The new study shows FUS droplets can draw in RNA polymerase II, a major transcriptional protein. Proteins in motion What scientists didn t know until Fawzi s team looked into the little droplets, however, was that the FUS proteins take no characteristic form, even when they are performing their RNA chaperone functions. Instead, they only produce functional droplet structures when many copies of FUS along with RNA combine into these droplets.  If a cell membrane is more like a wall, then a droplet is more like a huddle, where everyone takes their two hands and grabs on to someone else s shoulders in a random array,  Fawzi said.  That would keep it together   the proteins and RNA self-organizing with each other, rather than all being enclosed.  Fawzi, lead author Kathleen Burke, and their co-authors used both nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which can define the structure of biomolecules with atomic resolution, and fluorescence microscopy to make their observations about the perpetually unstructured lives of FUS proteins and their droplet-like huddles. Cracking the code? The protein s propensity to huddle into one kind of spherical arrangement vs. another appears to depend on its sequence of amino acids. Small repeating areas of amino acids work to form little strips of attachment along the protein strand. That s where the proteins can grab each other. Different arrangements of those positions may lead to the different functional formations.  There is some kind of code there, but we don t know how to read that code yet,  Fawzi said.  We can t yet predict what the function of the protein is going to be or who might interact with whom, or which partners might join into droplets together.  In the lab Fawzi is now studying how altering amino acid sequences affects FUS behaviors in hopes that it will lead to a clinically useful strategy against ALS and cancer. His prime targets are the mutations in FUS that are reported to cause some forms of ALS. Fawzi said funding and mentoring through two multidisciplinary biomedical research centers based in Rhode Island were integral to allowing the idea of the study to reach completion. The Center for Biomedical Research Excellence in Skeletal Health and Repair and the Rhode Island IDeA Network for Excellence in Biomedical Research are supported by the National Institutes of Health s Institutional Development Award (IDeA) program under grant numbers P20GM104937 and P20GM103430, respectively. These programsbuild research capacity in states that historically have had low levels of NIH funding by supporting basic, clinical, and translational research; faculty development; and infrastructure improvements.  This is an example of how the infrastructure development and collaborative network formation supported by the program can enable exciting and productive team approaches to address complex questions and move biomedical science forward,  said W. Fred Taylor, who directs the IDeA program at NIH s National Institute of General Medical Sciences.","Published: October 12, 2015"

But as researchers try to sort out the complex relationship between microbial populations and human health and use that information to diagnose or treat disease, they are generating a deluge of microbial sequence data that first needs to be organized and analyzed. To this end, University of California, San Diego School of Medicine s Rob Knight, PhD,and his team built a microbiome analysis platform called QIIME (pronounced  chime  and short for  Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology ). This software will now be more readily accessible to hundreds of thousands of researchers around the world through BaseSpace, a cloud-based app store offered by Illumina, a San Diego-based company that develops life science tools for the analysis of genetic variation.  Previously, we relied on personal contacts and scientific publications to spread the word about QIIME, and then users needed to download several different software packages to their own computers. Users also needed some technical programming skills to use QIIME,  said Knight, professor of pediatrics and computer science and engineering.  By working with Illumina, not only will many more researchers now be able to access QIIME from the cloud, the BaseSpace interface will make it much easier for non-technical researchers to analyze their data. This advancement will significantly ease the bottleneck in a variety of human and environmental microbiome studies.  Two high-profile microbiome studies that rely on QIIME are the Human Microbiome Project, a National Institutes of Health-led initiative akin to the Human Genome Project, and the American Gut Project, a crowdsourced, crowdfunded project in which Knight s team is sequencing as many human microbiome samples as possible, from anyone who wants to participate.  QIIME has proven to be a widely successful open-source project   the original paper our group published on it in 2010 has been cited by more than three thousand other papers since,  said Yoshiki V zquez-Baeza, an incoming UC San Diego Computer Science and Engineering graduate student in Knight s lab.  This collaboration, among many other things, will help us expand our user base and increase the availability of our methods.  Like Knight and more than 25 other members of his lab, V zquez-Baeza relocated from Colorado to UC San Diego this year, in part because of the collaborative spirit and innovative resources found in San Diego s life sciences research and biotechnology community.  BaseSpace is a cloud solution for data repository and analysis options that help streamline the processing of the seemingly ubiquitous genomic and metagenomic sequence data that researchers generate every day,  said Jay Patel, associate product manager of BaseSpace applications at Illumina.  QIIME is a highly utilized tool in metagenomics research and we are excited to make it part of the Illumina ecosystem.  Researchers are already eager to use QIIME in their own studies, including many at UC San Diego. ""We look forward to using QIIME on BaseSpace for our upcoming deep dive into the differences in the human gut microbiome in healthy people compared to people with inflammatory bowel disease,"" said Larry Smarr, PhD, professor and founding director of the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2) at UC San Diego. Here s how Knight, Smarr and their teams plan to apply QIIME to determine if certain microbes are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). They will process fecal samples from a group of IBD patients and a control group of healthy people and send the microbial genetic material they collect to the UC San Diego School of Medicine s Institute for Genomic Medicine for sequencing. When complete, the researchers will receive an email from the facility director indicating that their data are available on BaseSpace. Once they log into BaseSpace and click on the QIIME app, the researchers will see their raw data and ask the program to generate a 3-D scatterplot of the differences and similarities between their IBD and healthy control samples. If there is a significant difference in the microbial populations present in the two groups, then the researchers will go back to the lab to further investigate those differences and what cause-or-effect roles they might play in IBD. Eventually, Knight, Smarr and team hope they will be able to use this information to develop new tests that predict a person s risk of developing IBD and new methods for treating the disease. According to leading genomic and metagenomic assembly expert Pavel Pevzner, PhD, the Ronald R. Taylor Professor of Computer Science at UC San Diego and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the addition of QIIME to BaseSpace adds to a growing collaboration between UC San Diego and Illumina on computational tools.  Our own software   SPAdes Genome Assembler   has been available in the Illumina BaseSpace app store for some time, and has helped thousands of users assemble their genome data in a range of medical and scientific applications,  said Pevzner, who also directs the NIH Center for Computational Mass Spectrometry.  Adding QIIME to the expanding toolbox of world-leading bioinformatics software for genomic and metagenomic analysis paves the way for future innovations and collaborations with Illumina in this space.

These proteases must destroy their specific targets without damaging other proteins, but how this orderly destruction works is unknown in many cases. Now researchers in Peter Chien s group in the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst report finding how an essential bacterial protease controls cell growth and division.  Lead author Kamal Joshi, a doctoral candidate in the Chien lab, conducted experiments in the model bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. In this species, the ability to grow and replicate DNA is regulated by ClpXP, a highly conserved protease that in many bacteria allows them to cope with stressful environments such as the human body. Understanding how ClpXP is controlled could open a path to antibiotics that inhibit harmful bacteria in new ways.Chien explains that one of the long-standing mysteries in the field is how proteolysis controls Caulobacter growth.  The odd thing is that ClpXP is always present during different growth stages, but only destroys its target proteins at a specific time,  he says. This led his group to think,  There must be a missing factor that we couldn t see, because something has to come on the scene to accomplish this. There was some genetic evidence pointing to certain additional proteins, but we didn t know how they worked.  His lab took a biochemical approach to the problem, purifying all available proteins and designing experiments to query how they interacted and what functions were affected in their presence or absence. In this way,  Kamal found that the ClpXP protease could not by itself destroy the target proteins,  Chien says. Instead,  he found that the additional regulatory proteins we had detected were controlling different parts of the process.  Further, Joshi found that these newly identified regulatory adaptors worked in a step-wise hierarchical way. The first adaptor was directly responsible for degrading a handful of proteins, but it could also recruit an additional adaptor that would deliver a different set of proteins and bind even more adaptors. Working with the Viollier lab from the University of Geneva, Switzerland, the researchers found scores of additional protease targets that were destroyed in this hierarchical way. The researchers believe this new fundamental knowledge may offer an entirely new target for developing new antibiotics with a high potential to avoid triggering drug resistance. This is because new compounds could be devised which would not simply target all bacterial growth, but only a specific pathway, such as virulence. Such a protease-based technique would be very specific and less likely to generate the global selective pressure that leads bacteria to develop resistance. Chien points out,  In this approach, you don t force the benign bacteria to develop resistance because their growth isn t threatened. The hope is to target only those pathogenic organisms that are trying to overcome the stressful environment inside the human body.  At present, the researchers do not know if these adaptor factors are common among all bacteria, but they intend to find out.  How proteases selectively destroy their targets is a universal problem,  says Chien.  We think that these same mechanisms also may be found in other bacteria, but won t know until we start testing them. ","Published: October 12, 2015"

Last year, researchers identified a type of pathogen known as a densovirus as the likely cause, but they still can t explain the mass die-off three years ago or why a common ocean virus can wreak havoc on so many starfish species from Alaska to Southern California. Now, a group of young marine-disease researchers from around the country has contributed key information about the sea stars  immune response when infected with this virus. The students, while taking a summer class at the University of Washington s Friday Harbor Laboratories, looked specifically at how genes expressed themselves in both healthy and sick sea stars. It s the first time researchers have tracked how the genes behave when encountering this naturally occurring pathogen, which could help explain how sea stars attempt to fight the virus and why they develop lesions and appear to melt. Doing this study isn t going to save the sea stars, but from an ecological perspective, it provides new information,  said Steven Roberts, a UW associate professor of aquatic and fishery sciences.  This could be a building block for future studies on the evolution of immune repertoires.  Roberts co-taught the five-week course in summer 2014 with the UW s Carolyn Friedman, an associate professor of aquatic and fishery sciences, and Drew Harvell, a professor at Cornell University, with a focus on publishing results, methods and observations online using the Open Notebook Science Network. Students tracked their progress and discoveries through regular blog posts and videos, and all of their code and analyses are available for anyone to see and reproduce. This transparency, combined with the rigorous, all-consuming five weeks at Friday Harbor Labs, made it a useful and memorable experience, students said.  I learned so much about open science and the idea of having open lab notebooks, where everything is available. That has had the biggest impact on how I do my science,  said co-author Sarah Gignoux-Wolfsohn, a doctoral student at Northeastern University.  Open science was really integral to us being able to work on this paper together.  Sharing their results in a paper published in open-access journal PLOS ONE was an added bonus for this particularly driven group of students, Roberts said. The paper-writing and submission process all happened after class ended for the summer.  This was clearly the most experienced, ambitious group we ve had in this course,  Roberts said.  All of them certainly were dedicated to get it done.  The eight students who share lead authorship on the paper met for hours on video conference calls, talking through specific details of the paper. The students   from the University of Texas at Arlington, Pennsylvania State University, University of California, Santa Cruz and others   all contributed equally to writing and editing the manuscript, housed as a shared Google document, which is a rare approach in today s academic publishing world.  I work in smaller groups or with researchers from only one or two institutions for most of my projects,  said co-author Allison Tracy, a doctoral student at Cornell.  This was really interesting because we were able to collaborate across so many different backgrounds and institutions.  Before the students arrived at Friday Harbor Labs, the course instructors and research assistants collected sea stars from four sites in Washington, then infected some with the virus. They sent the samples away to get RNA data for each group of sea stars, then the students analyzed those data during class. The students started by looking at 30,000 genes from healthy and sick sea stars. They found that sick sea stars expressed genes differently than healthy ones, and they saw strong evidence of an immune response at the genetic level among infected sea stars. They also found that some of the genes involved in the nervous system and tissue-building were expressed differently in sick and healthy sea stars, which could help scientists better understand how the disease wreaks havoc on the sea stars  bodies. Researchers now suspect certain environmental conditions or perhaps water temperature contribute to the rate of disease or how effectively the sea stars can fight it off. As scientists around the country shift to monitoring sea star populations as well as studying the genetic code of the densovirus, they hopefully can use this initial characterization of how sea stars respond to disease, Roberts said.  This gives us a bit of insight into what s going on,  Roberts said.  One could argue that in the long term, this information could be used to build upon. ","Published: October 12, 2015"

Sodium channels, also known as VGSCs, exist in the membranes of excitable cells, such as neurons, where they are involved in the transmission of electrical impulses. Also present in breast cancer cells, research indicates they play a significant role in the growth and spread of tumours. Studying tissue specimens taken from patients with breast cancer, Dr Brackenbury found a significantly higher prevalence of Nav1.5 in tumour cells than levels found in normal breast tissue.In a separate study, researchers used a laboratory tool called shRNA to target sodium channels and suppress Nav1.5 production in cancer cells in mice. When using the shRNA in breast cancer cells, Nav1.5 levels were  knocked down , resulting in reduced tumour growth rates and metastasis compared to cells without shRNA. Dr Brackenbury said:  This research into Nav1.5 gives us further mechanistic understanding of this particular molecule s role in a cancer cell. As our separate studies show, this sodium channel is both upregulated in breast cancer and is also seen to play a key role in rates of tumour growth and metastasis.  Gaining a detailed understanding of the presence of Nav1.5 in tumours is significant as it could lead to a potential new diagnostic tool for breast cancer. The sodium channel s effect on tumour growth rates also signifies that Nav1.5 is a useful therapeutic target, perhaps holding a key to the development of future molecular treatments for specific cancers.  Dr Richard Berks, Senior Research Communications Officer at Breast Cancer Now, said:  Dr Brackenbury s findings are particularly fascinating as they suggest that sodium channels   previously only thought to have a role in neurons   could also be involved in the spread of breast cancer.  We re very proud to have supported this work. It is a prime example of the role of the Breast Cancer Now Tissue Bank in enabling scientists to better understand what s happening in real breast tumours, helping to improve both the quality and speed of their research.

Although transplant specialists have been able to reduce its impact, graft-versus-host disease remains a leading cause of death among patients who receive a stem cell transplant from another person, known as an allogeneic transplant. Such transplants are used to treat blood and bone marrow cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma, often as a last resort. Graft-versus-host disease occurs when immune cells from the transplant see the patient's body as foreign and attack it. In previous research, Sophie Paczesny, M.D., Ph.D., professor of pediatrics and of microbiology and immunology, and colleagues reported that patients with a high level of ST2 were more than twice as likely to have graft-versus-host disease that resisted standard treatment with steroids; and nearly four times as likely to die within six months of the transplant.In the new research, Paczesny and colleagues determined that the version, or isoform, of ST2 associated with graft-versus-host disease is produced at high levels in the intestines, where much of the damage from the disease occurs. Using mouse models of the disease, the researchers found that blocking the activity of ST2 resulted in reduced severity of graft-versus-host disease and lower mortality. In addition, blocking ST2 did not reduce the effectiveness of the transplant as a treatment for leukemia. The results, said Dr. Paczesny, ""provide a proof of principle that this molecule and associated pathways are potential targets for new therapies that could provide targeted treatment for patients most at risk for severe graft-versus-host disease."" Approximately 20,000 allogeneic stem cell transplants were performed worldwide in 2012. Thirty to 40 percent of stem cell transplant recipients whose donor is related will experience graft-versus-host disease. The percentage can rise to 60 to 80 percent if the patient and donor are not related. The researchers said the findings could also prove relevant to other immune system disorders where the same molecular pathways are involved.","Published: October 12, 2015"

These are two potential factors that have influenced the lack of take-up of the technology. However, recently, there has been a marked shift: it is not just vendors talking about MS, but also the clinical laboratories themselves. Does this mean that MS is becoming more widely accepted in a clinical setting? This article will explore why this shift has occurred and why it has taken so long.  Why is this a hot topic now?  MS has been in clinical laboratories for years, for example gas chromatography (GC) MS and MALDI-TOF. Tony Lewtas, Senior Marketing Communications Manager at Bruker Daltonics clarifies that  there is one area of clinical medicine where MS has not only been successfully introduced, but is also now established as the technique of choice for routine testing.  It is the application of MALDI-TOF in the clinical microbiology lab   and it may serve as a model for other MS techniques, in other clinical disciplines.  However, users often do not consider these as MS and this may be down to clever branding (for example with Bio-Merieux s VITEK: a MALDI-TOF) and lack of education. When people talk about the lack of MS in this context, they are generally referring to liquid chromatography (LC) MS, which has been shrouded in fear for clinical labs. The Freedom EVO  positive pressure SPE workstation allows complete process automation of SPE workflows in clinical and toxicological laboratories involving industry standard SPE cartridges. The system alleviates the constraints of performing SPE manually providing major time and cost savings as well as offer complete data traceability addressing quality compliance concerns.  Automating time-consuming SPE workflows would allow labs to save time, lower operational costs, ensure total data traceability and achieve faster ROI s on their expensive LCMS investments. Dr. Rohit Shroff, Product Manager, Clinical Diagnostics, Tecan What Are the Perceived Barriers to MS? Perception Fear of MS in clinical laboratories stems from the fact that, until recently, the technology was complex and required specialist skill. Furthermore, current technology, such as immunoassays, were just good enough for the needs of clinical scientists. Therefore, there has been no drive to adopt a new technology such as that seen in the life sciences sector.   Rohit Shroff, Product Manager at Tecan Schweiz AG, explains, however, that  MS offers high sensitivity and specificity  but that  despite the advantages, there has been a slow uptake in the clinics due to the human and capital investment  Skill gap A common factor cited is that most people working in clinical laboratories are not MS specialists. Dr. Scott Kuzdzal, General Manager of Marketing at Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, explains that  extensive training is required which is a barrier for deploying MS . Laboratory directors often have to take on the responsibility of training if they want to introduce MS into the laboratory. Also, as Dr. Kuzdzal points out, ""While HPLC has made huge strides in terms of reliability and robustness, it remains a 'high performance' technology with many parts and scheduled maintenance"". LCMS must become more like automated analyzers, with easier to use software. Jim Edwards, VP Product Manager of Indigo BioAutomation, adds  We've heard some people describe this as a knowledge gap, but it may also be an experience gap. Many people are exposed to the basics of chromatography and mass spectrometry in a variety of educational and work settings. However, not everyone gets the chance to apply those learnings in a 'real world' setting until they find themselves there, and then, it s often 'under the gun' of needing to perform the testing.  Edwards added that  Front-end automation is only half the battle . The volumes of data generated in even a small laboratory are immense.  Taking an admittedly limited case - looking at 100 samples a day for 50 compounds, where each compound is monitored by two ion transitions - means that someone's job is to look through 10,000 chromatographic peaks - individually, manually - just to get through one batch of results. Scaling that up to a more real-world example  thousands of samples a day; 150 compounds - and the volume of work becomes staggering, and difficult to consistently review, every time, on time . Victoria Zhang, the Founding Chair of the newly formed Mass Spectrometry and Separation Sciences (MSSS) Division at AACC , states that  the current labour-intensive and time-consuming process of mass spectrometry is one of the major huddles that have prevented labs from adopting MS at a much faster rate.  Automation of sample preparation, data processing and results reporting will encourage hospitals to view MS as a critical solution for better serving their patients and accelerate integration into their labs. .  Cost Zhang explains that  while it is hard to get a MS capital budget approved in hospitals, alternative means such as leasing have gained traction recently as a viable means for clinical labs to gain access to this powerful platform . The cost, real or perceived, of MS is a major barrier in its deployment. Simplification of the technology, however, is bringing costs down. Randy Julian CEO of Indigo BioAutomation explains that  while the cost of the instrumentation may be perceived as high in an absolute sense, in terms of its relative value and return on investment, there are medically necessary tests, critical to patient care, for which MS is uniquely capable .  Both Tecan and Indigo highlight two major areas where training is lacking: sample preparation and data handling.  Laboratory robotics companies have responded to industry needs for more automated sample preparation, while LC-MS instrumentation vendors have responded to those same needs by developing more performant, reliable, and robust ways to acquire data , comments Julian.  Pairing hardware automation such as this to advanced data handling and software automation is the best way to reduce end-to-end costs, while maximizing productivity and quality.  Kuzdal added that  I believe that mass spectrometry does save a lot of the costs and as users begin to go from one or two applications that s when you really get your moneys worth out of that one platform it s the way you utilize that . Lack of collaboration  Historically, MS vendors have focused on the life science market, such as proteomics, where users were more experienced in using MS and the technology was often the only viable solution to their challenges. In contrast, vendors have had challenges selling to the clinical market due to their lack of knowledge of clinical, or experience in talking to this audience.  Zhang states that  most vendors are not familiar with the clinical market and the unique concerns related to clinical lab operations and underestimate the staff training and regulatory requirements in a clinical setting .  Shroff added  Understanding the customers  value chain and bringing a superior working experience for the customer, along with providing the desired financial value, is key for further adoption of both automation and MS technology in the clinical industry. Vendors need to better understand the business drivers of diagnostic labs and offer solutions to their core business concerns. Today, labs aren t looking for vendors who sell hardware and software, they are looking for partners who can help them be successful in what they do and do so better than their competition . The lack of vendor experience in selling to this market produces the by-product of much less dialogue and collaboration between, not just industry and vendors, but also regulators.  It seems likely that clinicians will continue to hear about its enormous analytical effectiveness, but not embrace MS fully into routine because they know that it comes with complex workflows that do not fit into the typical clinical laboratory or the flow of patient care , explains Lewtas at Bruker. Is this changing?  The lack of collaboration between industry, vendors and regulators is actively being addressed.  Shows like MSACL are critical in getting the word out on connectivity between labs, academics and vendors: bringing them together to bring MS into clinical labs  comments Kuzdzal. In addition, AACC launched the Mass Spectrometry and Separation Sciences Division this year which has facilitated increased dialogue in the clinical market. Zhang explains that the goal at AACC  is to enhance the understanding and awareness of applications of MS in clinical labs, increase knowledge and connect regulatory bodies, different organisations and related institutions with vendors and manufacturers, to make MS a more powerful platform in clinical labs. There has never been a unit to put these together. That s why I think the division is so important. It is really a glue we can get everyone to share their ideas . The AACC division will be live streaming an upcoming debate on this topic, to observe use the following link:  https://aaccspectrometry.veomed.net/ In addition, the market is increasingly unhappy with the performance of existing techniques used in the clinical laboratory. Kuzdzal states that  immunoassays are good, but not perfect . Immunoassays are  prone to wrong results   both false positives and negatives  explains Schroff.  They typically cannot detect analytes at very low levels and cannot offer multi-analyte single assays . Furthermore, whilst MS used to be a large, time-consuming and error prone technique, the advances in bench top models that work at the touch of a button, have resulted in more automation and less skill required.  Developments in sample preparation and data handling, for example, are paving the way for wider adoption of MS in clinical labs. Shroff gave the example of hospitals and toxicology laboratories performing medico legal drug testing using Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) as a standard procedure to prepare clean samples prior to LC-MS analysis. The manual process of SPE is labor intensive and makes operators prone to repetitive strain injury. Human errors lead to lower turn-around-time, more repeat tests and therefore higher costs and overall lowered laboratory efficiency.  With the Freedom EVO  Positive Pressure SPE workstation, Tecan offers an end-to-end full SPE process automation solution which offers multiple benefits   a superior working experience for technicians working in the laboratory, higher profit margins and lower costs for lab managers, better ROIs on LCMS investments and faster results to physicians.  Other developments in MS technology and techniques that are fuelling the uptake in a clinical setting are highlighted below. Tecan: Sold Phase Extraction is a widely used sample preparation technique by which compounds of interest are extracted from complex biological matrices, prior to LCMS analysis. Clinical and toxicological laboratories performing medicolegal and biochemical testing, CRO s doing bio-analysis and bioequivalence studies as well as food labs performing contaminants/adulterants testing   all use SPE cartridges. SPE is typically a time-consuming and manual process prone to human errors leading to additional time and costs for labs to repeat tests. In addition, the slow nature of the SPE process leads to underutilization of expensive LCMS instruments, putting more pressure on lab managers who are already struggling to show faster ROI s and shorter payback times for their lab instrumentation. The Freedom EVO  positive pressure SPE workstation allows complete process automation of SPE workflows involving industry standard 1, 3 and 6mL SPE cartridges. The system offers significant benefits over the manual methods which is the status-quo for most laboratories. Time savings   The end-to-end process automation from primary samples to LCMS ready samples in vials reduces the time needed for sample preparation by at least 60-80% (other manual tasks can be done in parallel). Cost savings   Total process automation means there is a massive reduction in human-error induced repeat tests, thus lowering running costs for labs in terms of solvents, reagents and cartridges/consumables. In short, it enables labs to do more with less. ROI in LCMS investments   Shortened sample preparation time allows labs to analyse more samples on a daily basis on their expensive LCMS investments. This can enable lab managers to demonstrate a faster payback time and ROI for their LCMS investments.  SPE performance - Positive pressure is applied independently via individual liquid handling channels to each sample, allowing much greater control (flow rate) than a vacuum station. This results in reproducible SPE extraction with negligible dead volumes. Data traceability   Use of barcode scanning for samples allows the system to work with LIMS worklists ensuring sample traceability. Additional software features allow for monitoring of all sample transfer and extraction steps providing excellent chain-of-custody to labs working in regulated environments. Health and safety - Limiting direct contact of the technicians with specimens and chemicals also enhances their safety, limiting their exposure to potentially harmful materials. In addition, hands-free automation reduces the risk of repetitive-strain-injury (RSI) for laboratory operators. Simpler training regimes   Laboratories working in regulated environments spend a significant amount of time and money training new lab personnel to operate the instrumentation and maintaining the required training documentation. The Freedom EVO Positive Pressure SPE workstation can be operated via a user-guided software interface called TouchTools . The interface is tailored to individual laboratories application needs meaning running your applications can be as simple as entering the number of samples and pressing  RUN . This ensures that new personnel in labs require minimal training and also reduces the need for extensive training documentation. Employee engagement   Labs are challenged with providing their staff with engaging tasks to enhance their job satisfaction, thus limiting attrition. However, trained scientists and technicians carry out non-engaging, repetitive tasks such as SPE leaving them under-utilized and dissatisfied. Sample preparation automation would allow lab managers to engage their talented staff in more intellectual tasks while the robot takes care of the repetitive sample extraction procedures. This translates to better utilization of talent as well as higher employee satisfaction. Shimadzu: Shimadzu s Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (LCMS-8050 CL) triple quadrupole LCMS/MS incorporates proprietary ultrafast technologies as well as an ion source and collision cell technology. The LCMS-8050 CL features high sensitivity, high data quality and the world s fastest data acquisition rates. It meets the growing demand for trace-level quantitation in clinical in vitro diagnostics and other markets. Acquisition occurs so rapidly that MS/MS scans and MRM measurements can be performed concurrently while maintaining quantitative accuracy. MS/MS scans at 30,000 u/sec, combined with high speed polarity switching equates to higher clinical lab throughput and enables positive and negative analytes to be measured in a single run. This reduces the cost of operation significantly. Indigo BioAutomation: ASCENT is a hosted platform that automates the processing, reviewing, and reporting of LC-MS/MS data.  The software enables an enormous acceleration of certified result release - including auto-release - through a variety of advances.  Proprietary, patented technical insights in peak processing address the complex nature of high-throughput LC-MS/MS analysis in biological fluids.  Review operations, as required, are focused on rapid visualization of relevant exceptions, identified by a customizable quality rules engine.  When finished, ASCENT can securely and automatically make results available to the LIS, as well as present dashboards of laboratory operations and performance. Bruker: Bruker s MALDI Biotyper Microbial Identification system was introduced as a  research use only  product in 2007. Hailed as revolutionary in clinical microbiology, The MALDI Biotyper is a next generation microbial identification system based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. It allows an unbiased identification of microorganisms and delivers MS in an easy to use, rapid, robust, high-throughput, cost-effective and efficient package that matches clinical workflow and meets the needs of patients. Importantly, everything was designed by a team with a singular purpose: no specialist MS knowledge would be required and training and implementation in the lab would be no more complex than other clinical analyzers.  With turn around times of minutes rather than hours (or days) and running costs that can be between 50% and 90% less expensive than traditional tests, this is a perfect match of technology, methodology and cost efficiency.  Trajan: The hemaPEN , a novel prototype blood collection and storage device, is the first product concept from ASTech, the ARC Training Centre for Portable Analytical Separation Technologies   a $5.2 M program part funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC), University of Tasmania (UTAS) and Trajan.  Chief Executive Officer of Trajan, Stephen Tomisich said:  This first iteration of hemaPEN  harnesses the benefits of Dried Blood Spot (DBS) sampling and provides a format tailored and ready for LC-MS. It is the only device of its kind in the world that allows the collection of an uncontaminated and precise volume of blood from the fingertip.  DBS technology is traditionally used in new-born screening but the limitations of current delivery formats have stalled the broader adoption of DBS for routine blood analysis. It can be difficult to correctly place a drop of blood onto the traditional card format; and the amount of blood isn t measured so quantitative analytical work is limited. The card itself can become contaminated through mishandling; and, if the DBS on the card is to be  punched  to create a sample disk for analysis, then the location of the punch within the spot is often not representative of the blood sample. hemaPEN is a hugely exciting development as it directly addresses these limitations. Trials of the device with patients are due to start soon. Conclusion The prevalence of MS is increasing in clinical laboratories due to improved dialogue, simplification of technology, changing perceptions and training. It is an exciting time to be embracing mass spec in a clinical lab that was powerfully summarised by Zhang who described how  fortunate I feel to be able to contribute to this field at this critical moment. I feel that I can make a difference, working with my colleagues at the MSSS Division, AACC, and other related organizations such as ASMS, MSACL, FDA and  NIH to drive not only the next generation of mass spec, but the next generation of clinical labs. It won t be easy, but I am very happy with the progress we are making.  Together, we will make our dreams come true to drive the advancement of MS for the betterment of patient care.

LBBW Venture GmbH, MBG Mittelst ndische Beteiligungsgesellschaft BW and KfW Bankengruppe were the main investors in the Series A round. Together with founding investors High-Tech Gr nderfonds HTGF and Seedfonds BW, who have supported the company since 2010, this fresh capital will be used to develop and market label-free analytical devices for the life sciences sector. The analytical devices developed by Biametrics, which are based on patented 1-lambda RIDe technology, operate on a completely label-free basis, even at very low detection limits. Standard measurement processes using fluorescent dyes can have a significant influence on the activities of the biomolecules being investigated. The new technology can be used, for example, to generate valuable data on the binding properties of biomolecules that are important, among other things, for the development of new pharmacological active ingredients. At the same time, the analytical sequences are robust, fast and low-cost, with measurement results available after just a few minutes. The group of investors consisting of LBBW Venture GmbH, MBG Mittelst ndische Beteiligungsgesellschaft BW, KfW Bankengruppe, High-Tech Gr nder-fonds HTGF and Seedfonds BW was impressed by the performance of the business, which was established five years ago in the STERN BioRegion by technical biologist Dr. G nther Proll and chemist Dr. Florian Pr ll. The spin-off from the University of T bingen has raised a total of 3.1 million euros to develop its innovative analytical devices, which utilize patent-protected surface chemistry that is based on years of development work. 1-lambda-RIDe technology detects the interactions between biomolecules. Materials with different optical properties partially reflect light at layer boundaries while allowing it to pass through at other areas. Where the reflected rays cause interference, i.e. superimpose each other, the reflected pattern changes. The measuring sensor reacts to this process. Light-permeable materials, such as glass or plastic with coated surfaces are used as consumables for the optical biosensors. The Biametrics  b-screen  analytical device is being marketed in collaboration with partner Berthold Technologies GmbH & Co. KG (Bad Wildbad, Germany). As the device can be used to investigate up to 10,000 interactions per square centimetre in the shortest possible space of time, it is primarily ideal for high-throughput screening and for identifying new pharmaceutically relevant molecules on standard microarrays, as already being used in the area of fluorescence microarrays. Meanwhile, the mobile b-portable can be used to take measurements directly at the point of need and obtain a result immediately. The analytical device can thus also be used for on-site monitoring in bioreactors or fermentation plants and in human and animal diagnostics. Passengers at airports can even be checked for virus particles in next to no time using this technology.","Published: October 10, 2015"

GLPG1837 was shown to be safe and well-tolerated and demonstrated favorable drug-like properties in the study. GLPG1837 is a candidate drug for the treatment of the Class III mutation in cystic fibrosis. It is expected that GLPG1837 will be combined with other Galapagos candidate drugs to create a potential triple combination therapy for Class II patients, the largest CF-patient group. Galapagos conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study over a range of single and multiple doses of GLPG1837 in healthy human volunteers in Belgium. In the single ascending dose (SAD) part of the study subjects were exposed to single oral doses of 30 to 2000 mg. In the multiple ascending dose (MAD) part of the study, GLPG1837 was given orally at doses of 125 to 800 mg twice daily for a period of 14 days. On safety, GLPG1837 up to a single dose of 2000 mg and up to 800 mg twice daily for 14 days was generally safe and well tolerated in this study. There were no adverse effects observed on ECG, vital signs, or on laboratory parameters. Treatment-emergent adverse events were rare, with the most common adverse events reported being headache and tiredness. The pharmacokinetics of GLPG1837 also proved favorable in this study. Rapid absorption occurred, with a mean apparent elimination half-life of 6-15 hours. The bioavailability of GLPG1837 was improved with food. Steady state was attained within the second dosing, with no accumulation. The company believes the results from this Phase 1 study support rapid progression into a Phase 2 study in Class III mutation patients, which is expected to commence before year end 2015.","Published: October 10, 2015"

For 10 years, a global initiative called the Blue Brain Project--hosted at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL)--has been attempting to do this digitally with a section of juvenile rat brain. The project presents a first draft of this reconstruction, which contains over 31,000 neurons, 55 layers of cells, and 207 different neuron subtypes, in the journal Cell. Heroic efforts are currently being made to define all the different types of neurons in the brain, to measure their electrical firing properties, and to map out the circuits that connect them to one another. These painstaking efforts are giving us a glimpse into the building blocks and logic of brain wiring. However, getting a full, high-resolution picture of all the features and activity of the neurons within a brain region and the circuit-level behaviors of these neurons is a major challenge. Henry Markram and colleagues have taken an engineering approach to this question by digitally reconstructing a slice of the neocortex, an area of the brain that has benefited from extensive characterization. Using this wealth of data, they built a virtual brain slice representing the different neuron types present in this region and the key features controlling their firing and, most notably, modeling their connectivity, including nearly 40 million synapses and 2,000 connections between each brain cell type. ""The reconstruction required an enormous number of experiments,"" says Markram, of the EPFL. ""It paves the way for predicting the location, numbers, and even the amount of ion currents flowing through all 40 million synapses."" Once the reconstruction was complete, the investigators used powerful supercomputers to simulate the behavior of neurons under different conditions. Remarkably, the researchers found that, by slightly adjusting just one parameter, the level of calcium ions, they could produce broader patterns of circuit-level activity that could not be predicted based on features of the individual neurons. For instance, slow synchronous waves of neuronal activity, which have been observed in the brain during sleep, were triggered in their simulations, suggesting that neural circuits may be able to switch into different ""states"" that could underlie important behaviors. ""An analogy would be a computer processer that can reconfigure to focus on certain tasks,"" Markram says. ""The experiments suggest the existence of a spectrum of states, so this raises new types of questions, such as 'what if you're stuck in the wrong state?'"" For instance, Markram suggests that the findings may open up new avenues for explaining how initiating the fight-or-flight response through the adrenocorticotropic hormone yields tunnel vision and aggression. The Blue Brain Project researchers plan to continue exploring the state-dependent computational theory while improving the model they've built.

Joining the event were more than 50 distinguished participants from the international scientific, clinical and industry community involved in the development of novel cancer treatment modalities. The Symposium, held at 4SC's site in Martinsried/Munich, discussed recent advances in epigenetic drug discovery and the clinical impact of epigenetic and immune therapeutic approaches on personalized medicine. Epigenetic alterations as well as tumour immunity represent key mechanisms in the development of cancer and are therefore considered relevant therapeutic targets. The challenge of treating, and ultimately curing, cancer and as well as the potential of combining immunotherapy with epigenetic approaches was highlighted by Prof. Andreas Mackensen, Director at the Department of Haematology & Internal Oncology at the Erlangen University Hospital, who chaired the conference and paved the way for three scientific talks around epigenetic alterations, their role in health and disease and as modulators of tumour immunity. Prof. Thomas Jenuwein, keynote lecturer from the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology & Epigenetics in Freiburg and the first scientist to identify a histone methylating enzyme, opened the event by highlighting that epigenetic malfunction is key to the development of cancer, as it significantly influences the timing and aggressiveness of the disease. For example, an aberrant chromatin marking of a tumour suppressor gene, which is then silenced, leads to uncontrolled proliferation of the cancer cell. This is where epigenetic therapy comes into play: inhibitors for chromatin-changing enzymes, one prominent example being histone deacetylase, short HDAC inhibitors, possess the ability to reprogram aberrant transcription, i.e. turn on tumour suppression. Epigenetic regulators can also help break the tumour's tolerance towards the immune system, for example by triggering ""anti-tumour"" immune responses via the presentation of neo-antigens or maintenance of T-lymphocyte activation. Furthermore, Prof. Jenuwein presented an Agouti mouse model demonstrating the importance of epigenetic mechanisms for the prevention of cancer. In this Agouti mouse a change in the mother's diet had a significant corresponding influence on the offspring, indicating that epigenetic changes can also propagate to the next generations. The underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood but most likely involve non-coding RNAs that bind their respective (complimentary) DNA sequence in order to transport epigenetic signals. Prof. Angela Risch, Head of the Cancer Genetics/Epigenetics Division at the University of Salzburg, showcased how epigenetic characterization of cancer is already used in the clinic. For instance, epigenetic profiles (e.g. DNA methylation) can be used to predict a patient's therapeutic outcome, which in certain tumours already outperforms standard histopathological classification. She also expanded on the clinical potential for epigenetic profiling to identify risk groups, epigenetic biomarkers for early detection or response to treatment and the inhibition of key epigenetic regulators. Interestingly, 4SC has been able to detect a new biomarker in the blood of patients, called ZFP64, during their clinical studies with its epigenetic agent resminostat in advanced liver cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma. The biomarker's expression prior to resminostat treatment has been shown to correlate with patients' overall survival in both indications. The predictive value of the ZFP64 biomarker, however, needs to be further validated. It is currently under evaluation in ongoing clinical studies. Translating research findings into the clinic remains a challenge. As Prof. em. Roland Mertelsmann, University Medical Center, Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg, pointed out: epigenetic regulation produces a highly variable cancer phenotype that can rapidly adapt to a changing environment and also to treatment. Cancer can only be cured if you kill the last tumour cell. In order to succeed in the fight against cancer, a patient's own defense system must be activated; the inhibition of so-called immune checkpoints (molecules that can turn immunological signals on or off) is thought to be one way to liberate the endogenous immune system (so called ""releasing the break""). ""Two hands will better grab a target than one finger"", Prof. Jenuwein noted. In fact, all three speakers agreed that the most powerful approach would certainly be a combination of checkpoint inhibition and the expression of neo-antigens on cancer cells via epigenetic therapies. In other words, strengthen the immune system and weaken the tumour, thereby rendering it more vulnerable to immune system attack. Things had come full circle when Dr. Daniel Vitt and Dr. Susanne Danhauser-Riedl; Chief Scientic Officer and Chief Medical Officer, respectively, of 4SC elaborated on the epigenetic drug candidates in 4SC's pipeline and how these drugs address cancer therapies. The company identified multiple features of their two clinical stage cancer drugs, i.e. resminostat and 4SC-202, which would prime cancer cells for subsequent immunotherapy. As an example and as shown in preclinical tests, resminostat enhances the immunogenicity of cancer cells as it restores the expression of ligands important for lymphocyte binding (i.e. natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells) and tumour-associated antigens, at the same time reducing unspecific immunosuppressive mechanisms. Enno Spillner, Chief Executive Officer of 4SC AG commented: ""This symposium confirmed 4SC is on a good path in the development of its epigenetic regulators, resminostat as well as 4SC-202. In the US, HDAC inhibitors have already been approved and successfully used in the clinic. 4SC and its partners have been and/or are currently developing resminostat in a number of indications including liver, lung, pancreatic and biliary tract cancer and soon in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). We welcome the participation of so many international experts as well as our Asian development partners for resminostat from Yakult Honsha and Menarini AP in our Symposium."" Summing up 4SC's work in the field, Prof. Jenuwein concluded: ""I am very happy to see the development of smart epigenetic inhibitors has been brought to such a high quality by 4SC. This biotech company is at the forefront in Germany for the successful translation of epigenetic therapy to the clinic and for the patient."" Combination approaches provide ways toward improving existing therapies and developing new ones with the aim to provide survival benefit for larger numbers of patients. To further investigate the properties of resminostat and 4SC-202 as immunomodulators and their potential combination with immunotherapy agents, such as checkpoint inhibitors, 4SC has recently been awarded a grant from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research of up to EUR 450,000 as part of the European Eurostars programme.","Published: October 10, 2015"

That new strategy is based on models that researchers developed to classify cancers caused by KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) mutations, which cause cells to grow uncontrollably. Although KRAS-driven cancer mutations have long been a focus of cancer research, effective targeted therapies are not available.  This work further supports the idea that not all oncogenic KRAS mutations function in the same way to cause cancer. The model we developed may help in subclassifying KRAS-mutant cancers so they can be treated more effectively, using therapies that are tailored to each mutation,  said Dr. Kenneth Westover, Assistant Professor of Radiation Oncology and Biochemistry.  Furthermore, this study gives new fundamental understanding to why certain KRAS-mutant cancers, for example those containing the KRAS G13D mutation, behave as they do.  The findings are available in Molecular Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. KRAS is one of the main members of the RAS family. About a third of all human cancers, including a high percentage of pancreatic, lung, and colorectal cancers, are driven by mutations in RAS genes, which also make cells resistant to some available cancer therapies, according to the National Cancer Institute. Specific KRAS mutations dominate in particular cancer types, giving rise to the notion that certain KRAS mutations may have distinct biological activities. Laboratory and clinical data support this hypothesis. In this study, the researchers evaluated eight of the most common KRAS mutants for key biochemical properties including nucleotide exchange rates, enzymatic activity, and binding activity related to a key signaling protein, RAF kinase. The researchers observed significant differences between the mutants, including about a tenfold increase in the rate of nucleotide exchange for the specific mutant KRAS G13D, highly variable KRAS enzymatic activities, and variability in affinity for RAF. They also determined high-resolution, three-dimensional X-ray crystal structures for several of the most common mutants, which led to a better understanding of some of the biochemical activities observed.  We attempted to use the observed structural changes to explain these differences in biochemical behavior. By integrating our data, we have proposed a biochemical classification scheme to predict the propensity of different KRAS mutants to signal through RAF kinase. If validated, our model could have value for selecting targeted therapies for cancer patients with specific KRAS mutations,  said Dr. Westover. Members of the Westover lab plan to continue this line of work by testing their models in more complex experimental systems, such as genetically engineered cancer cell lines. Dr. Westover works as both a clinician as a member of the Radiation Oncology team at the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, and as a researcher in the Departments of Radiation Oncology and Biochemistry. The Westover laboratory investigates the molecular basis of cancer with a focus on developing tailored cancer therapies.

The new technique, which yields cells resembling those found in older people's brains, will be a boon to scientists studying age-related diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. ""This lets us keep age-related signatures in the cells so that we can more easily study the effects of aging on the brain,"" says Rusty Gage, a professor in the Salk Institute for Biological Studies' Laboratory of Genetics and senior author of the paper, published in Cell Stem Cell. ""By using this powerful approach, we can begin to answer many questions about the physiology and molecular machinery of human nerve cells -- not just around healthy aging but pathological aging as well,"" says Martin Hetzer, a Salk professor also involved in the work. Historically, animal models -- from fruit flies to mice -- have been the go-to technique to study the biological consequences of aging, especially in tissues that can't be easily sampled from living humans, like the brain. Over the past few years, researchers have increasingly turned to stem cells to study various diseases in humans. For example, scientists can take patients' skin cells and turn them into induced pluripotent stem cells, which have the ability to become any cell in the body. From there, researchers can prompt the stem cells to turn into brain cells for further study. But this process -- even when taking skin cells from an older human -- doesn't guarantee stem cells with 'older' properties. ""As researchers started using these cells more, it became clear that during the process of reprogramming to create stem cells the cell was also rejuvenated in other ways,"" says Jerome Mertens, a postdoctoral research fellow and first author of the new paper. Epigenetic signatures in older cells -- patterns of chemical marks on DNA that dictate what genes are expressed when -- were reset to match younger signatures in the process. This made studying the aging of the human brain difficult, since researchers couldn't create 'old' brain cells with the approach. Gage, Hetzer, Mertens and colleagues decided to try another approach, turning to an even newer technique that lets them directly convert skin cells to neurons, creating what's called an induced neuron. ""A few years ago, researchers showed that it's possible to do this, completely bypassing the stem cell precursor state,"" says Mertens. The scientists collected skin cells from 19 people, aged from birth to 89, and prompted them to turn into brain cells using both the induced pluripotent stem cell technique and the direct conversion approach. Then, they compared the patterns of gene expression in the resulting neurons with cells taken from autopsied brains. When the induced pluripotent stem cell method was used, as expected, the patterns in the neurons were indistinguishable between young and old derived samples. But brain cells that had been created using the direct conversion technique had different patterns of gene expression depending on whether they were created from young donors or older adults. ""The neurons we derived showed differences depending on donor age,"" says Mertens. ""And they actually show changes in gene expression that have been previously implicated in brain aging."" For instance, levels of a nuclear pore protein called RanBP17 -- whose decline is linked to nuclear transport defects that play a role in neurodegenerative diseases -- were lower in the neurons derived from older patients. Now that the direct conversion of skin cells to neurons has been shown to retain these signatures of age, Gage expects the technique to become a valuable tool for studying aging. And, while the current work only tested its effectiveness in creating brain cells, he suspects a similar method will let researchers create aged heart and liver cells as well.

Now, researchers at University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in Craig Montell's lab have used fruit flies and mice to make novel discoveries about sensory physiology at both cellular and molecular levels that are important for light processing. Their most recent findings, which improve the scientific understanding of the signaling cascade necessary for phototransduction -- the process by which light is converted into electrical signals in the photoreceptor cells in the retina of the eye -- appear in the journal Cell Reports. More than 25 years ago, Montell discovered TRP channels, which allow animals to detect light, chemicals in food, mechanical force and changes in temperature. These proteins act at the cell surface, but very little was known about the mechanism by which they are transported to the cell surface. Until now, scientists knew of only one protein, XPORT, that was a ""helper protein"" involved in getting TRP proteins to the outer surface of cells. However, using the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), postdoctoral fellow Zijing Chen found that the XPORT gene in fact encodes two unrelated molecular chaperone proteins -- XPORT-A and XPORT-B -- and both are critical for moving TRP channels out of their synthesis site inside the cells. ""This discovery is important because if TRP proteins don't get to the cell surface, they are not going to be able to function, and the animals will not see properly,"" said Montell, a professor in UCSB's Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. ""The light that activates the photoreceptor cells is not directly activating TRP but rather a light sensor called rhodopsin,"" Montell explained. This primary pigment found in photoreceptor cells is extremely sensitive to light. ""What's interesting is that both XPORT-A and XPORT-B are required for getting rhodopsin and TRP to the cell surface,"" he added. According to Montell, mutations in TRP have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, pain syndromes, neuropathies and bone deformations. Understanding the intricacies of TRP function is the first step toward identifying drugs that could affect their activity and one day be used as therapeutic targets. TRP channels also function in light sensation in mammals, including humans. However, they do not have central roles in rods or cones, which allow mammals to see images. Rather, TRPs in mammals function in a third class of photoreceptor cell, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). The ipRGCs are necessary for setting circadian rhythms by light as well as pupillary constriction in response to light. The ipRGCs are activated by bright light and also stimulated through pathways initiated in rods and cones. However, the pathways and molecules that allow rods and cones to stimulate ipRGCs indirectly by light have been poorly understood. In another paper, published in the journal Molecular Biology of the Cell, Marquis Walker, a postdoctoral fellow working with Montell, used mice to explore the indirect pathway for activating ipRGCs. They found that a protein called retinal degeneration B2 (RDGB2) was critical in connector neurons called amacrine cells located in the inner retina, between the rods and cones and ipRGCs. ""This study reveals the first molecular player that is important in sending signals from the rods into the ipRGCs,"" Montell said. ""This indirect communication allows the ipRGCs to respond to dim light that activates rod photoreceptor cells."" The first RDGB protein was identified in the eye of the fruit fly and Montell and Walker wanted to determine its role in the mammalian retina. They found that RDGB2 in mice is required for normal circadian activity and pupil constriction -- but only in dim light. ""Understanding all the cells, pathways and molecules is necessary if you want to develop therapies for jet lag or problems related to circadian rhythm,"" Montell said. ""We need to understand the whole cellular and molecular mechanism in order to ultimately come up with new approaches and drugs to deal with these issues.""

Latest research from the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS, Bangalore), now shows that maintaining Calcium balance in cells is also needed for another purpose - it may be regulating the levels of an important signaling molecule called dopamine in the brain. Current work from Prof. Gaiti Hasan's lab at NCBS has identified new roles for Calcium signaling. Prof. Hasan's group show that a process called SOCE (Store Operated Calcium Entry) which works to maintain calcium levels in cells could also play a role in maintaining the levels of dopamine, a vital neurotransmitter in the brain. SOCE is a process by which Calcium ions slowly enter cells to refill Calcium stores that have been depleted by various activities. Since the cell membrane or the outer covering of the cell is impermeable to Calcium ions, Calcium enters the cell through dedicated calcium channels. One such Calcium channel is a protein called Orai, which is an indispensable requirement for SOCE to work. Prof. Hasan's work used Drosophila flies with mutated Orai genes that prevented normal operation of the SOCE process. A key finding in their experiments was that when SOCE was inhibited only in certain neurons before the flies matured, the emerging adults could not fly. With no SOCE, the wiring process to create a 'flight circuit' in the fly brain did not develop - so, why is this important? The importance of this result is that it revealed a potential link between SOCE and the neurotransmitter called dopamine. Dopamine is an indispensable signal molecule in the brain, whose deficiency causes various diseases, the most famous of them being Parkinson's syndrome. In the flightless Orai mutant flies, SOCE was inhibited in a set of cells called 'dopaminergic interneurons' - nerve cells that used dopamine to relay signals. Further investigations into this phenomenon revealed that SOCE and its role in maintaining Calcium levels within nerve cells affected processes related to dopamine synthesis and transport at a genetic level. ""We expected that inhibiting calcium refill via SOCE in nerve cells would impair their functioning and perhaps ultimately kill them. It was quite a surprise when we discovered instead that the SOCE process was affecting the level of enzymes required for synthesizing dopamine. The bigger surprise was that this phenomenon was occurring at the level of gene expression"", says Trayambak Pathak, who is the first author on the publication which has appeared in the Journal of Neuroscience. The implications of this work are intriguing. If SOCE operates similarly in mammalian cells, it might have some role to play in diseases where dopamine plays a significant role such as Parkinson's, Attention Deficit Syndromes (ADS) and even schizophrenia. ""There is still so much more to understand in these processes. Our work has opened up a plethora of questions about the importance of SOCE in nerve cells. It may even provide us with new pathways to explore for treatments of conditions such as Parkinson's disease"", says Prof. Hasan. Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Hasan G et al.

These patients then face the prospect of a long wait with numerous diagnostic tests and attempts to locate the origin of the cancer before starting any treatment. Now, researchers at DTU Systems Biology have combined genetics with computer science and created a new diagnostic technology based on advanced self-learning computer algorithms which on the basis of a biopsy from a metastasis can with 85 per cent certainty identify the source of the disease and thus target treatment and, ultimately, improve the prognosis for the patient. Each year, about 35,000 people are diagnosed with cancer in Denmark, and many of them face the prospect of a long wait until the cancer has been diagnosed and its source located. However, even after very extensive tests, there will still be 2-3 per cent of patients where it has not been possible to find the origin of the cancer. In such cases, the patient will be treated with a cocktail of chemotherapy instead of a more appropriately targeted treatment, which could be more effective and gentler on the patient. Fast and accurate results  The newly developed method, which researchers are calling TumorTracer, are based on analyses of DNA mutations in cancer tissue samples from patients with metastasized cancer, i.e. cancer which has spread. The pattern of mutations is analysed in a computer program which has been trained to find possible primary tumour localizations. The method has been tested on many thousands of samples where the primary tumour was already identified, and it has proven extremely precise. The next step will be to test the method on patients with unknown primary tumours. In recent years, researchers have discovered several ways of using genome sequencing of tumours to predict whether an individual cancer patient will benefit from a specific type of medicine. This is a very effective method, and it is becoming increasingly common to conduct such sequencing for cancer patients. Associate Professor Aron Eklund from DTU Systems Biology explains: ""We are very pleased that we can now use the same sequencing data together with our new algorithms to provide a much faster diagnosis for cancer cases that are difficult to diagnose, and to provide a useful diagnosis in cases which are currently impossible to diagnose. At the moment, it takes researchers two days to obtain a biopsy result, but we expect this time to be reduced as it becomes possible to do the sequencing increasingly faster. And it will be straightforward to integrate the method with the methods already being used by doctors."" Researchers expect that, in the long term, the method can also be used to identify the source of free cancer cells from a blood sample, and thus also as an effective and easy way of monitoring people who are at risk of developing cancer.","Published: October 9, 2015"

This variation of the distinct cell types comes from the differential expression of genes, which is controlled by interplay between different regulators within the cells, such as transcription factors, the transcription machinery, and the  epigenetic  modifications (which do not change the underlying genetic code) that occur on the DNA and protein factors within chromatin. In a study co-directed by Roderic Guig , a CRG principal investigator and a UPF professor, and Montserrat Corominas, at the Department of Genetics of the University of Barcelona (UB) and the Institute of Biomedicine of the UB (IBUB), the scientists show that the chromatin marks are irrelevant for regulating genes that are expressed in a punctual manner during development. The results of this study contrast sharply with the generally accepted view of the key roles that these epigenetic marks play in regulating gene expression. The project was based on gene expression data from the modENCODE project, which aims to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive encyclopedia of functional elements of the genome of model organisms. In this case, the researchers used data about the genomic expression from the nematode worm C. elegans and the fruit fly D. melanogaster. ""We didn t set out to study the relationship between the epigenetic chromatin marks and gene expression during development, but rather to analyze the function of these marks in DNA processing. But we soon saw that there were some highly-expressed genes that did not have the epigenetic marks on their chromatin which are thought to be required to maintain such high levels of expression. We first considered that this could be an experimental artifact, since it is common for developmental genes to be expressed only in a few specific cells, which could lead to the signals from the marks being diluted out and not detected. However, when we analyzed the data from the modENCODE project, we realized that the genes that were regulated during development were indeed expressed even though they lacked the chromatin marks one would expect. A lot of our work has focused on experimentally confirming these results,"" explains Montserrat Corominas. Embryonic development is a well-studied process in which the precise regulation of gene expression is critical, since many genes are expressed simultaneously and in a punctual manner. The work from these two research groups in Barcelona now offers novel information for understanding this process, by focusing on a set of genes that act during development and are specific to certain tissues. ""At the present, we already have computer models that help us to predict the patterns of expression for genes based on their chromatin modifications. Our work now adds a new aspect that was previously not even contemplated, which will help us to make predictive models even more reliable,"" said Roderic Guig . ""Our results are based on the expression of genes in two model organisms. Now we have to see whether what we observed in these two organisms also holds true for humans. If so, the results from our study will be useful for improving approaches to manipulate or modulate the levels of gene expression which would be extremely useful for studying and treating those diseases that we know are caused by the expression of specific genes,  concluded Guig .","Published: October 9, 2015"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/will-brain-palpation-soon-be-possible-214041,Will Brain Palpation Soon Be Possible  Researchers have developed non invasive brain imaging technique which provides the same information as physical palpation   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. If there is one technique used by the physician to explore the human body during every medical examination in order to make a diagnosis or prescribe further tests, it is palpation. By its nature, however, the brain cannot be palpated without using a highly invasive procedure (craniotomy, or opening the skull), which is limited to rare cases. By drawing on seismology, Inserm researchers led by St fan Catheline (Inserm Unit 1032, ""Therapeutic Applications of Ultrasound"") have just developed a non-invasive brain imaging method using MRI that provides the same information as physical palpation. Ultimately, it could be used in the early diagnosis of brain tumours or Alzheimer's disease.  Many diseases involve structural changes in tissues, which are reflected in a change in their mechanical properties, such as elasticity. Using the sensitivity of their hands, and their detailed knowledge of the body, physicians, through an examination known as palpation, can assess the size and stiffness of a tumour, the presence of inflamed lymph nodes, or the size and position of the foetus in a pregnant woman, to mention a few examples.This palpation has been supplemented or replaced by modern techniques that give the physician an indication of the elasticity of a biological tissue. They are based on the generation and detection of waves that propagate through the body at varying speeds depending on the stiffness of the organs (the stiffer the tissue, the slower the wave propagation, and vice versa). However, this method cannot be applied to the brain, which, doubly protected by the cranium and cerebrospinal fluid, is difficult for externally applied waves to access. It is therefore impossible to directly or indirectly palpate the brain, something that greatly complicates the work of neurosurgeons. On the other hand, the brain is the seat of natural vibrations created by the blood pulsating in the arteries and the circulating cerebrospinal fluid. There remained a significant unprecedented challenge: how to capture this complex field of natural shear waves, and represent it on a computer screen. In this article, Inserm researchers, using MRI, have succeeded in detecting natural shear waves in the brain using computational techniques borrowed from seismologists and known as ""noise correlation"".They were thus able to build images of the brain's elasticity. ""If this method can be developed for clinical use, it will be a boon for both the patient and the physician, since making the brain vibrate is quite painful at the moment. Of course, this method will be complementary to those that already exist, and the future is in a multimodal medical diagnosis,"" says St fan Catheline, Inserm Research Director and main author of this work. ""Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and hydrocephalus involve changes in the stiffness of the brain tissues. This new technique allows their detection, and could be used to avoid brain biopsies. "" This method for palpating the brain could have other areas of application, such as for analysing the development of neurodegenerative processes, the impact of a lesion from a trauma or tumour, response to treatment, etc.","Published: October 9, 2015"

They also determined that it plays a decisive role in the production of antibodies and the formation of B cells, which are a type of white blood cells. Various teams of researchers had already found that Kidins220/ARMS is present in nerve cells and in T cells of the immune system. However, that it is present in B cells was unknown until now.  We ve discovered a new molecular player in the immune system,  said the immunobiologist Prof. Dr.Wolfgang Schamel, adding,  This knowledge could help to develop new medications for autoimmune diseases or other illnesses in the future.  The postdoc Dr. Gina J. Fiala from Schamel's lab is the lead author of the group s publication. Fiala studied Kidins220/ARMS in B cells for her doctoral thesis. Several other members of the cluster of excellence BIOSS Centre for Biological Signalling Studies also collaborated in this study. B lymphocytes, also known as B cells, are the only cells to produce antibodies, which the immune system needs to fight off foreign intruders like pathogens in order to protect the human body. On their surface, B cells carry B cell receptors. These activate the B cells when an antigen   a substance on the surface of a pathogenic germ   binds to them. The team of scientists from the University of Freiburg has discovered that Kidins220/ARMS interacts with the B cell receptor and affects signalling pathways from the receptor to the interior of the cell. Without Kidins220/ARMS, the receptor s ability to send signals is limited. As a result, the B cells manufacture less antibodies and the immune system is weakened.  Kidins220/ARMS is also vital for the formation of B cells. If a mouse cannot produce this protein, the B lymphocytes develop in a way that makes them less functional than the B cells of a healthy immune system. The reason for this is that B cells depend on the signals from the B cell receptor and pre-B cell receptor, which is the early version of a B cell receptor, at various stages of their development. Deficiency in Kidins220/ARMS therefore obstructs the development of B cells. ","Published: October 9, 2015"

These new directions reflect recommendations made by the Interagency Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Coordinating Committee (IBCERCC) in 2013. IBCERCC was congressionally mandated to review the state of the science around breast cancer and environmental influences by the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act. Recommendations included prioritizing prevention, involving transdisciplinary research teams, engaging public stakeholders, collaborating across federal agencies, and communicating the science to the public. This broadened research focus will add to the growing knowledge of environmental and genetic factors that may influence breast cancer risk across the lifespan. The six new BCERP projects, plus a new coordinating center promoting cross-project collaboration, are jointly funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and the National Cancer Institute. All projects involve strong partnerships between researchers and organizations focused on breast cancer prevention or environmental health. The new research will be conducted at the following institutions;   Brigham and Women s Hospital, Boston   City of Hope/Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, California   Columbia University, New York City   Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, D.C.   Michigan State University, Lansing   University of Massachusetts, Amherst   University of Wisconsin   Madison (Coordinating Center)  The beauty of this research is that scientific discoveries and community observations inform each other, in order to dive deeper into the complex causes of breast cancer,  said Gwen Collman, Ph.D., director of NIEHS Division of Extramural Research and Training. The focus on minority and socio-economically disadvantaged women is an important step in addressing disparities in breast cancer outcomes. Although African-American women are diagnosed with breast cancer less often than white women, more aggressive cancers and breast cancer deaths are more common among African-American women. Another new direction for BCERP is research on the role of breast density as a possible intermediate risk factor for breast cancer. Dense breast tissue is one of the most common risk factors for breast cancer. Identifying links between environmental exposures and high breast density may provide new insights into prevention.  These priorities reflect our continued commitment to breast cancer prevention,  noted Caroline Dilworth, Ph.D., BCERP program lead at NIEHS.  Our goal is to build on the high quality science we ve been funding for more than a decade, while also being responsive to the expert recommendations of the IBCERCC report.

Pesticide use, household and outdoor air pollution, mining hazards and other occupational and environmental risk factors cause almost one quarter of the world s deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The greatest burden of disease caused by these exposures occurs in LMICs, where there is limited capacity to study the links between these risk factors and illness. In addition, more than two million workers around the world die every year due to occupational injury or related ailments, costing the global economy billions of dollars, as reported by the International Labor Organization. Each hub will be supported by a pair of five-year awards   one to an LMIC lead institution for research on key topics of regional importance and another to a U.S. institution to oversee relevant research training. The hubs are intended to become internationally recognized centers for the collection, management, synthesis and interpretation of data on environmental and occupational health. Together the seven hubs will form the GEOHealth Network, a platform to build research leadership in environmental and occupational health in LMICs, and foster the exchange of knowledge and use of evidence to inform policies. NIH s Fogarty International Center is coordinating and partially funding the awards, in collaboration with NIH partners, the National Cancer Institute and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Also providing support is the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Canada s International Development Research Centre is contributing to the funding of research led by LMIC scientists. The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves is also participating in the GEOHealth program by offering supplemental funding for research and training focused on household air pollution.  We know that air and water pollution, pesticide exposure, climate change and other environmental and occupational risk factors contribute to the growing burden of noncommunicable diseases in LMICs,  said Fogarty Director Dr. Roger I. Glass.  These research hubs are designed to develop a critical mass of scientists who can discover how these exposures trigger diseases, identify effective interventions and spur policy changes that will improve health.  The overall goals of the GEOHealth Hubs are to strengthen environmental and occupational health-related research collaborations, accelerate scientific infrastructure development, enhance research training, create relevant advanced educational curricula and outreach material, support research needed to address environmental and/or occupational exposures and inform nationally relevant policy development in LMICs. A hub in India will focus on air pollution and developing the scientific expertise to study the unique characteristics of exposures in that country, while a center in Bangladesh will address household air pollution, climate change and occupational health in the garment worker industry. Another hub will be located in Peru to develop scientific capacity and support research on air pollution and climate change, including activities with scientists in the neighboring countries of Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile. Neurotoxins related to mining and agricultural development and their impact on maternal and child health throughout the Caribbean will be examined from a hub based in Suriname. Meanwhile, scientists at a center in Thailand will investigate pesticides commonly used in agriculture across Southeast Asia to see if they act as endocrine disrupters, increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome and associated diseases such as diabetes, stroke and heart disease. A hub based in Ethiopia will develop spokes in Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda to study air pollution, climate change and occupational health related to temperature. Finally, research and training in West Africa will focus on health threats from electronic waste, gold mining and transportation-related ambient air pollution, led from a center in Ghana.","Published: October 9, 2015"

Professor John Wilding, who leads Obesity and Endocrinology research in the Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, investigates the pathophysiology and treatment of both obesity and type 2 diabetes and is applying his expertise in this area to work with, and often act as a consultant for, a number of large pharmaceutical companies looking to develop new treatments for obesity and diabetes. Exciting development Professor Wilding, said:  The biology of GLP-1 has been a focus of my research for 20 years; in particular when I was working at Hammersmith Hospital in London, I was part of the team that demonstrated that it was involved in appetite regulation; work on GLP-1 has continued during my time in Liverpool. Being involved in the development of a treatment, from the basic research right through to clinical trials in patients is very exciting .  It is likely that the treatment will be used initially in very specific situations, such as helping patients who are severely obese. It differs from current treatments used for diabetes, as it has stronger appetite regulating effects but no greater effect on glucose control.  In 2014 more than 1.9 billion adults worldwide were classed as obese by the World Health Organisation; in the UK numbers have more than tripled since 1980. This Obesity can lead to other serious health-related illnesses including type 2 diabetes, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnoea as well as increasing the risk for many common cancers. The drug has been approved in the European Union, but has not yet launched in the UK. Professor Wilding added:  Consultancy like this can help relationship and reputation building and informs my research keeping it at the forefront of developments. It also brings many other benefits such as publications and income generation, which can help support other research, for example by such as funding for pilot projects that can lead to grant applications and investigator-initiated trials funded by the company .","Published: October 9, 2015"

This result is expected to help scientists design and manufacture new and more effective medicines. The molecules, called cytochrome P450s, are known as  nature s detoxifiers,  said Courtney Krest Roach, a beamline scientist at SLAC s Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL)   a DOE Office of Science User Facility   and first author of the paper.Since cytochrome P450 was discovered more than 50 years ago, more than 11,000 variants have been identified in every kingdom of life, including animals, plants, fungi and bacteria. Some 57 different P450s are found in humans, typically in the liver, where they help break down poisons and unwanted molecules. They are also essential in the body s manufacture of certain hormones, and chemists hope to be able to use them in the future to catalyze the creation of complex molecules for use in medicine and industry.  Our bodies use P450s to perform one step in the metabolism of some 75 percent of pharmaceuticals,  Roach said.  And the P450s  extreme selectivity can enable much more direct and efficient synthesis of a number of high-value hydrocarbons and organic molecules.  Molecular Structure is Key Each cytochrome P450 is optimized to catalyze an initial  activation  step in a specific chemical reaction. They all share the same basic atomic structure: A central iron atom is surrounded by four nitrogen atoms, with a sulfur-based structure sticking out from one side of the ring. Activation creates an intermediate compound that has an oxygen atom double-bonded to the iron atom; it sticks out from the other side of the ring. Because the P450s  intermediate compounds were short-lived, chemists who were trying to learn how they worked tried studying a slightly simpler molecule, called CPO, which had a more stable intermediate. But they found it was much less reactive than the P450s   in some cases only one-fortieth as reactive. Researchers needed to know why, because a more reactive P450 can break stronger bonds, metabolize new medicines or make different final products. The new experiments at SSRL were led by Penn State University Professor Michael Green, who was Roach s PhD advisor. The research team used the absorption of X-rays by the intermediate forms of CPO and P450s to make ultraprecise measurements of their atomic structures. The results showed that the big difference in reactivity was caused by a miniscule, 9-trillionths-of-a-meter difference in the lengths of their iron-sulfur bonds. Small Changes, Big Impact   Slight changes in hydrogen bonding near the central iron atom shortened the length of the P450s  iron-sulfur bond by 4 percent. This changed the distribution of nearby electrons in a way that weakened and lengthened the iron-oxygen double bond on the opposite side of the ring. This, in turn, made it easier for the oxygen atom to carry out its part in the activation process, thus increasing P450s  reactivity.  SSRL is the only place that we could do these experiments with the necessary quality,  Roach said.","Published: October 9, 2015"

The scientists identified a previously unsuspected job performed by the enzyme, ALDH1a1, in mice. The discovery could help guide the development of medications that extinguish the urge to consume alcohol, said Jun Ding, PhD, assistant professor of neurosurgery. The study s lead author is postdoctoral scholar Jae-Ick Kim, PhD.Alcoholism is an immense national and international health problem. More than 200 million people globally, including 18 million Americans, suffer from it. Binge drinking substantially increases the likelihood of developing alcoholism. As many as one in four American adults report having engaged in binge drinking in the past month. Existing medications for treating alcoholism have had mixed results. Disulfiram (Antabuse) and similar substances, for example, work by inducing unpleasant side effects   including shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting and throbbing headaches   if the person taking it consumes alcohol.  But these drugs don t reduce the craving   you still feel a strong urge to drink,  Ding said.  In the new study, Ding and his associates showed that blocking ALDH1a1 activity caused mice s consumption of and preference for alcohol to rise to levels equivalent to those observed in mice that had experienced several rounds of the equivalent of binge drinking. Restoring ALDH1a1 levels reversed this effect. Previous studies have shown that mutations in the gene for ALDH1a1 are associated with alcoholism, but the reasons for this have been obscure. A key finding in the new study is that in certain nerve cells strongly implicated in addictive behaviors, ALDH1a1 is an essential piece of a previously unknown biochemical assembly line for the manufacture of an important neurotransmitter called GABA. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that bind to receptors on nerve cells, promoting or inhibiting signaling activity in those cells. GABA is the brain s main inhibitory neurotransmitter. It was previously thought that GABA was made in mammalian brains only via a different biochemical assembly line that doesn t involve ALDH1a1. An alternative assembly line While GABA is produced widely throughout the brain, the novel GABA-production assembly line identified by Ding s group was observed only in a group of nerve cells known to play a powerful role in addiction. The new finding has potentially great clinical significance because a drug that could increase GABA synthesis through this alternative assembly line   by boosting ALDH1a1 levels in the brain   could potentially restore the balance in neural circuitry that s been thrown out of kilter by excessive alcohol consumption without dangerously elevating GABA levels elsewhere in the brain.  Another neurotransmitter substance, dopamine, is famous among neuroscientists for its involvement in modulating motion and motivation. Dopamine supercharges the machinery of the brain s so-called reward circuit, which is involved in all types of addictive behavior from cocaine, morphine and alcohol abuse to compulsive gambling. The reward circuit is a network of nerve cells and connections found in the brains of living creatures from flies to humans and every animal in between. It guides individuals  behavior   and ensures species  survival   by offering pleasurable sensations as a reward for eating, sleeping, having sex and making friends. Key components of this circuit are fueled by dopamine. Until recently, neuroscientists widely assumed that each type of nerve cell in the brain can release one and only one neurotransmitter. But in a study published in Nature in 2012, Ding, then a postdoctoral scholar at Harvard Medical School, and his colleagues demonstrated that dopamine-producing nerve cells can manufacture and release other types of neurotransmitters, too, including GABA. These cells not only produce both dopamine and GABA but release them simultaneously.  We wondered what GABA is doing in there,  Ding said.  Why does one nerve cell need two neurotransmitters?  Ding also had another question.  All of us normally encounter countless reward-inducing situations without getting addicted,  he said.  Every time I publish a paper, my dopamine-producing nerve cells go crazy, but I don t get addicted. Why not?  GABA s Role in Countering Addiction To find out whether GABA in dopamine-producing cells might have something to do with addiction, Ding and his associates initially tried to examine GABA s effects by blocking its production through the conventional assembly line   that is, the only one known at the time   while stimulating only dopamine-producing cells in mice s brains. To their surprise, these tried-and-tested methods failed to reduce GABA levels in these cells or the neurotransmitter s effects on nearby downstream nerve cells. That was puzzling. Curious, Ding began a literature search to see if there were any other ways that biological systems manufacture GABA. He learned that in plants, GABA can be produced via a biochemical assembly line quite separate from the common, previously known one our brains use. He found that one step in this alternative GABA-manufacturing pathway is performed by a family of enzymes, aldehyde dehydrogenases, that are better known for being involved in the breakdown of alcohol. Ding also found that aldehyde dehydrogenases are expressed not only in the liver, where most of the alcohol we drink gets metabolized, but in some parts of the brain that, to Ding   whose professional career has focused on the brain s dopamine-producing nerve circuitry   looked anatomically identical to the dopamine-producing nerve cells that feed the reward circuit. Ding s team verified that the specific family member at work in those dopamine-producing cells was ALDH1a1. Using advanced laboratory methods to impair ALDH1a1 activity in mice, the scientists saw GABA levels in dopamine-producing nerve cells drop, just as they did when mice with normal ALDH1a1 activity underwent repeated bouts of high alcohol intake   the equivalent of binge drinking. In behavioral tests, the ALDH1a1-deficient mice showed the same increased alcohol preference and intake as did otherwise normal  binge-drinker  mice. These effects were reversed by manipulations that raised ALDH1a1 levels in the mice. Ding said he thinks that GABA s co-release with dopamine, and GABA s inhibitory character, may be what prevents everyday pleasurable sensations from causing most of us, most of the time, to become addicted to the behaviors that produce them. Mutations in ALDH1a1, he said, may predispose some people to alcoholism by disabling this brake on our reward machinery. His lab is now exploring whether the same molecular mechanisms may be at work in other forms of addiction.","Published: October 9, 2015"

With a poor prognosis and limited options for targeted therapies, fighting SS needs new treatment approaches.  The team s results uncover a previously unknown, complex genomic landscape of this cancer, which can be used to design new personalized drug regimens for SS patients based on their unique genetic makeup. Sezary syndrome is a rare condition: Its incidence is estimated to be about 0.3-2 cases per 100,000 in the United States each year, and those patients have a five-year survival rate of less than 30 percent. Penn Medicine has the one of the largest referral clinics for treatment of SS patients in the country. Taking a thorough approach to find SS mutations, senior authorsMegan S. Lim, MD, PhD, a professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Kojo Elenitoba-Johnson, MD, the Peter C. Nowell, M.D. Professor and director of the Center for Personalized Diagnostics, were not disappointed.  We basically found chromosomal chaos in all of our samples,  Elenitoba-Johnson said.  Lim is also director of Hematopathology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and The Children s Hospital of Philadelphia. The team integrated three, complementary gene sequencing approaches to look for mutations in tumor cells from SS patients: whole-genome sequencing in six subjects, sequencing of all protein-coding regions (exomes) in 66 subjects, and comparing variation in the number of copies of all genes across the genome in 80 subjects.  We did not expect the degree of genetic complexity that we found in our study,  Elenitoba-Johnson added. They identified previously unknown recurrent loss-of-function mutations that target genes regulating epigenetic pathways   ones that act on how tightly or loosely chromosomes are wound and thus accessible for genes to be expressed. One of these targets is called ARID1A, and they found that loss-of-function mutations and/or deletions in ARID1A occurred in over 40 percent of the SS genome studied. They also identified  gain-of-function  mutations in PLCG1, and JAK1, JAK3, STAT3 and STAT5B.  In preliminary drug-mutation matching studies, they found that JAK1-mutated SS cells were sensitive to JAK inhibitors, drugs that are currently approved for treatment of other hematologic cancers such as polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis.  With knowledge like this, we can design clinical trials using JAK inhibitors for SS patients based on their JAK mutations,  said Elenitoba-Johnson.  But this is just the start. These results highlight the genetic vulnerabilities that we can use in designing precision medicine therapies.    The Penn team, in collaboration with Alain Rook, MD, director of the Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma Program and a professor of Dermatology, aims to develop a molecular taxonomy for mutations in SS patients. With the state-of-the-art DNA sequencing technology used in this study, they will be able to pinpoint the exact mistake in each patient s SS-related genes. From this, they will also be able to identify distinct subsets of the disease to stratify patients for precision therapy based on their unique mutations and the inhibitors available for those mutations.","Published: October 9, 2015"

This process sees molecules driven between the layers of a graphite electrode to separate them.  The process is radically different from chemical vapour deposition (CVD) methods, which are used to grow individual graphene layers upon a substrate, and generally require high processing temperatures with low throughput.

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and the Karp Lab at Brigham and Women s Hospital have jointly designed a specialized catheter for fixing holes in the heart using a biodegradable adhesive and patch. As the team reports in Science Translational Medicine, the catheter has been used successfully in animal studies to facilitate hole closure without the need for open heart surgery. Pedro del Nido, M.D., Chief of Cardiac Surgery at Boston Children s and contributing author on the study, says the device represents a radical change in the way these kinds of cardiac defects are repaired. ""In addition to avoiding open heart surgery, this method avoids suturing into the heart tissue, because we re just gluing something to it."" Catheterizations are preferable to open heart surgery because they don t require stopping the heart, putting the patient on bypass, and cutting into the heart. The Heart Center at Boston Children s is committed to pursuing the least invasive methods possible to correct heart defects, which are among the most common congenital defects. Last winter, the unique adhesive patch was published in Science Translational Medicine. This represented a large step forward in the quest to reduce complications associated with heart defect repair. While medical devices that remain in the body may be jostled out of place or fail to cover the hole as the body grows, the patch allows for heart tissue to create its own closure and then dissolves. To truly realize the patch s potential, however, the Boston Children s/Wyss/SEAS/Brigham and Women s research team sought a way to deliver the patch without open heart surgery. Their newly designed catheter device utilizes UV light technology and can be used to place the patch in a beating heart. The catheter is inserted through a vein in the neck or groin and directed to the defect within the heart. Once the catheter is in place, the clinician opens two positioning balloons: one around the front end of the catheter, passing through the hole, and one on the other side of the heart wall. The clinician then deploys the patch and turns on the catheter s UV light. The light reflects off of the balloon s shiny interior and activates the patch s adhesive coating. As the glue cures, pressure from the positioning balloons on either side of the patch help secure it in place. Finally, both balloons are deflated and the catheter is withdrawn. Over time, normal tissue growth resumes and heart tissue grows over the patch. The patch itself dissolves when it is no longer needed. ""This really is a completely new platform for closing wounds or holes anywhere in the body,"" says Conor Walsh, Ph.D., contributing author on the study, Wyss Institute Core Faculty member, Assistant Professor of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering at SEAS, founder of the Harvard Biodesign Lab at SEAS, and author of the paper. ""The device is a minimally invasive way to deliver a patch and then activate it using UV light, all within a matter of five minutes and in an atraumatic way that doesn t require a separate incision."" SEAS/Wyss Institute s Ellen Roche, Ph.D., co-first author on the paper along with Boston Children s Assunta Fabazzo, M.D., adds that the device is designed to be customizable. For instance, the rate at which the patch biodegrades can be slowed or accelerated depending on how quickly the surrounding tissue grows over it. Further studies will reveal the appropriate lengths of time for different circumstances. Jeff Karp, Ph.D., a bioengineer at Brigham and Women s Hospital and a co-founder of Gecko Biomedical, developed the glue product in his lab at Brigham and Women s Hospital. Gecko Biomedical will be testing the glue product in humans later this year. ""Our collaboration across hospitals and institutions to find new and minimally invasive applications for this glue in clinical settings is a great multi-disciplinary example,"" Karp said. ""We are translating our discoveries in the lab into solutions for patients."" ""The way the glue works in the face of blood is revolutionary. We don t have to stop the heart,"" says del Nido. ""This will enable a wide range of cardiac procedures in the future.""","Published: October 9, 2015"

The announcement follows a worldwide exclusive licensing agreement between Harvard s Office of Technology Development (OTD) and Opsonix Inc. enabling the company to ready the Wyss-designed sepsis therapy for clinical use. Pathogen-induced sepsis strikes at least a million people every year in the U.S.   more than prostate cancer, breast cancer and AIDS combined   and over 30% percent of these cases are fatal. There is no therapy specifically approved to treat sepsis and the present standard of care is limited to providing patients with intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics, which often does not suffice to halt disease progression. Existing therapies also cannot combat the growing emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and thus, sepsis represents a huge unmet clinical need.""We are developing an entirely new approach to treat sepsis that directly and quickly eliminates the pathogens and toxins that trigger the sepsis cascade. Even more importantly, we can accomplish this without having to first identify the infectious agent,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Don Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Key to the technology is a genetically engineered protein that is based on a naturally occurring human opsonin protein called Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL). With its ability to bind to a broad spectrum of infectious invaders and endotoxins released by them into the blood stream, MBL usually funnels circulating blood pathogens to the immune system's innate clearance apparatus. However, to be able to leverage MBL as a blood-cleansing tool, the Wyss team led by Ingber and Michael Super, a Wyss Senior Staff Scientist, fused the pathogen-binding portion of MBL to the Fc region of human immunoglobulin to yield the engineered FcMBL protein. During the technology's incubation period, for which the Wyss Institute was funded with more than $22 million by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under their Dialysis-Like Therapeutic program, the researchers cleared several obstacles along the preclinical development path.  Putting it to the test in a proof-of-principle study the team attached FcMBL to nanoscale magnetic beads and demonstrated their ability to effectively clear a wide variety of pathogens and endotoxin from human blood samples when exposed to a magnetic field in a device mimicking the spleen or Biospleen. Moreover, when applied to an extra-corporeal blood circuit attached to septic rats, the Biospleen rapidly cleansed the animals' blood, significantly suppressed their sepsis inflammatory cascades, and prolonged their survival. ""To further de-risk and improve the technology, we had to simplify the device by eliminating the possibility of magnetic beads being carried back into the patients' circulation, and show that the pathogen-extracting method is compatible with current antibiotic therapies,"" said Super. These challenges now have been successfully addressed in a newly designed device format that has recently been published. To simplify the therapy for eventual clinical use, the Wyss team attached the pathogen-capturing FcMBL protein to the inner surface of hollow fibers similar to those contained in cartridges already approved by the FDA for dialysis therapy. When tested in rats infected with pathogens or endotoxin, the FcMBL-coated cartridges synergized with commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics, reducing the infectious pathogen and toxin loads and stabilizing vital signs in the animals more effectively than antibiotics alone. Using FcMBL in cartridges had other important benefits, too: it sped up the pathogen extraction process and considerably reduced the amount of FcMBL protein needed for each individual treatment. Opsonix has launched with Series A financing led by Baxter Ventures and its founding team includes CEO Eric Devroe, Ph.D., and Scientific Founders Ingber and Super. The company will use the proceeds of the Series A financing to advance the development of the therapy toward clinical investigation.","Published: October 8, 2015"

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/compound-doubles-up-on-cancer-detection-191135,Compound Doubles Up On Cancer Detection Researchers have found that tagging a pair of markers found almost exclusively on a common brain cancer yields a cancer signal that is both more obvious and more specific to cancer   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The research, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, shows a promising new avenue for early tumor detection that, in principle, should apply to a wide range of cancers. The new technique also suggests methods for more precise cancer treatment. The idea of searching for two markers has been around for a while, but it was technically very difficult to achieve, says co-first author Haiming Luo, a UW-Madison postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Radiology.   The researchers were directed by Weibo Cai, an associate professor of radiology and medical physics in the UW School of Medicine and Public Health. They created antibodies that are specific to two proteins that often mark brain tumors. One marker, called CD105, appears on new blood vessels, which in adult humans only grow during pregnancy or when wounds heal. Mutations in the other marker, epidermal growth factor receptor, spark uncontrolled cell division in a number of cancers, including glioblastoma.To make a structure able to bind to both of these markers, the researchers chopped off unneeded sections of each antibody, then assembled them with a fast, reliable joint. The construct contained a fast-decaying isotope that can be detected in a PET (positron emission tomography) scanner.  After purifying the detection compound to remove unpaired antibodies, the researchers injected the remainder into mice that had received transplants of human glioblastoma tumors.  After waiting up to 36 hours for the detector molecules to link to tumors or clear from normal tissue, the researchers searched with a PET scanner for the radiation they released. The result was a great increase in the intensity of the signal, compared to conventional PET scanning. A second benefit was specificity: The detector linked to tumors, yet hardly any connected to healthy tissue.  When PET scans are used to detect cancer, they usually look for glucose metabolism - a sign of biological activity that can be linked to cancer, or many other possible causes. Activity in the brain, where cancer detection is particularly troublesome, can mask the signal of cancer. The study points toward a ""toolkit"" approach to cancer detection, says co-first author Reinier Hernandez, a graduate student in medical physics. Studies on other tumors are progressing, he says, based on well-known targets on particular cancers that appear in genetic databases.  By demonstrating a new way to connect to tumor cells while avoiding normal tissue, the new technique immediately suggests ways to treat cancer rather than just identifying it, Hernandez says. ""The whole field is moving toward more specific treatment, rather than chemotherapy, which can damage healthy tissue as well as tumors."" The two-part antibody could, for example, be joined to a strong, quick-acting unit of radiation, or to a chemical that can kill cells, says Cai.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-a-molecular-motor-untangles-protein-197171,How a Molecular Motor Untangles Protein Diseases such as Alzheimer s  Parkinson s and prion diseases  all involve  tangled  proteins  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A marvelous molecular motor that untangles protein in bacteria may sound interesting, yet perhaps not so important. Until you consider the hallmarks of several neurodegenerative diseases   Huntington s disease has tangled huntingtin protein, Parkinson s disease has tangled  -synuclein, and Alzheimer s disease has tangles of tau and  -amyloid. In fact, a similar untangling motor from yeast has already shown effectiveness in mouse and nematode models of Huntington s disease. So Aaron Lucius, Ph.D., professor in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Department of Chemistry, is studying the bacterial protein ClpB ofE. coli, as a steppingstone to expanded research on medically significant models in coming years. The question is how does ClpB actually do its job to untangle proteins? We don t know how proteins get tangled, but if we can study how proteins get disaggregated, it may have clinical relevance,  Lucius said. ClpB is one of a vast assortment of similar molecular machines found in all living cells, known as hexameric AAA + enzymes. They have six subunits that form a hexagon with a hole in the middle, and they burn ATP for energy. While the machines are all similar, the kinds of work they do vary widely   examples include unwinding DNA, helping digest proteins, untangling proteins, cutting microtubules, helping shape plant cells and driving membrane fusion. ClpB is closely related to the ClpA enzyme of E. coli. Unlike ClpB   which has the job of untangling a protein that has lost its proper shape   ClpA helps to digest unnecessary proteins into small peptide fragments. Proteins are chains of amino acids, linked together like beads on string, and then folded into a precise shape. ClpA is able to grab one end of a protein that has been marked for recycling, and pull it through the central hole of ClpA, like an anchor chain winched in through the hawse hole of a ship. ATP hydrolysis powers that processive pulling, and the unraveled protein chain is pushed into an attached ClpP enzyme, which cuts up the chain  like a molecular paper shredder,  Lucius said. A previous lab group had garnered evidence that ClpB is also a processive translocase, meaning that it pulls the protein chain all the way through that central hole in a long series of stepwise tugs, but they were forced to introduce an artefact into the ClpB enzyme to do their experiments. Lucius and his fellow UAB researchers are now challenging that model. After finding a way to test ClpB without introducing the artefact, their experimental results show that the ClpB enzyme makes only one or two tugs on the tangled protein, and then lets go.  Our results support a molecular mechanism where ClpB catalyzes protein disaggregation by tugging and releasing exposed tails or loops,  they wrote in a paper recently published in the Biochemical Journal, similar to how someone would tug at the loose strands of a tangled ball of yarn. This proposed new paradigm of how ClpB functions may apply to other untangling enzymes.  It will take time to see if it is accepted,  Lucius said. The study of hexameric AAA+ enzyme function requires sophisticated experimental approaches.  We can t see the proteins; we have to come up with clever ways to infer what they are doing,  Lucius said. His lab discovered such a clever technique in 2010 while working with ClpA. But when graduate student Tao Li tried to apply it to ClpB studies, and expected to find similar results of processive translocation that the earlier group had reported,  she did three years of every possible experiment to see if it translocates and found no evidence in support of translocation,  Lucius said. So the UAB lab began to consider alternatives, which led to the finding that the ClpB enzyme made only one or two tugs before releasing the substrate protein. They also tested ClpB that had the artefact inserted and found evidence that what had appeared to be translocation to the previous researchers was only nonspecific protein degradation without translocation through the central hole of ClpB. The experimental approach ClpB binds to the substrate protein in the presence of an ATP analog that promotes binding but cannot function to power the enzyme. The bound substrate has a fluorescent label attached to its far end, but that fluorescence is dampened by the binding to ClpB. The mixture is put into one syringe, and high concentration of ATP and unlabeled substrate is put into another syringe. With the press of a trigger, a piston powered by 120-pounds-per-square-inch nitrogen gas mixes the contents of the two syringes together within two-thousandths of a second, and now, in the presence of ATP, the ClpB machine can go to work. This technique is known as fluorescence stopped-flow.  The UAB researchers look for the increased fluorescence when ClpB releases the labeled substrate. If the enzyme is pulling the labeled substrate protein through the central hole of the hexamer, there will be a time lag before the fluorescence increases. That lag will increase as longer substrate proteins are tested. But if the ClpB only tugs once or twice, and then releases the substrate, there will be no lag. Conditions are set so that, after each single ClpB hexamer releases its fluorescently labeled substrate, the enzyme will not bind another because there is an excess of unlabeled substrate. Thus, this fluorescence stopped-flow method shows only a single turnover for each enzyme complex. When this system was used with ClpA, there was a lag before fluorescence increase, and that lag increased with increased length of the substrate protein. Both those results are consistent with the ClpA enzyme, powered by ATP, pulling the substrate protein through its central hole. With a 127-amino-acid substrate, that lag lasted 10 seconds. When this system was used with ClpB, there was no lag, and the length of the substrate made no difference in how quickly the fluorescent signal increased. Thus, ClpB was releasing the substrate quickly.","Published: October 8, 2015"

Scientists say that horses affected by the disease - called equine grass sickness - could also hold clues to human conditions. Nerve condition Grass sickness attacks nerve cells in horses but the causes of the disease are unknown. It causes gastric upset and muscle tremor and can kill within days. If diagnosed quickly, animals can sometimes be nursed back to health. Post mortem Researchers from the University of Edinburgh s Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies looked at nerve tissue from six horses that had died from equine grass sickness in a bid to investigate the causes of the condition. They found that the horse tissue contained proteins that are commonly seen in the brains of people with Alzheimer s disease - such as the build-up of amyloid protein. New tests In total, 506 different proteins were found to be altered in nerve tissue from horses with grass sickness, compared with animals that had died from other causes. This knowledge could help to develop tests for detecting the condition in horses, which can be tricky to diagnose. Dr Tom Wishart , Career Track Fellow, The Roslin Institute, commented  This is the first study to show similarities between an apparently unrelated neurodegenerative disease of large animals and human neurological conditions. Although the causes of these conditions are unlikely to be shared, the findings suggest that similar mechanisms could be involved in the later stages of disease.  Grass sickness Around two per cent of horses die from grass sickness each year in the UK. The disease occurs almost exclusively in grass-fed animals, including ponies and donkeys. A similar condition is thought to affect cats, dogs, hares, rabbits, llamas and possibly sheep.","Published: October 8, 2015"

The grants are aimed at advancing the care of patients living with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. The Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania, which houses the Basser Center, will administer the awards. The grants represent the second year of funding under the Basser External Research Grant Program, which supports translational cancer research projects with strong potential to advance rapidly into clinical practice. To date, the Center   The projects funded this year are among the most promising of BRCA-related cancer research anywhere,  said Susan Domchek, MD, executive director of the Basser Center for BRCA and the Basser Professor of Oncology at the Abramson Cancer Center.  Our colleagues across the country are doing exceptional work to continue providing real hope to at-risk patients, and we are pleased to play a role in ensuring that their research is given every opportunity to be completed, and potentially applied to patient care.  Four new projects are receiving Basser Innovation Awards this year.   Principal investigator Geoffrey Shapiro, MD, PhD, of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and colleagues will examine the use of a specific protein, THZ-5-31-1, which may stop the body from accidentally repairing breast cancer cells, rather than letting them die after being treated with PARP inhibitors, a class of drugs proven to be effective in the treatment of breast and other cancers.   Knowing the protein make-up of a tumor can help predict how a patient will respond to different types of cancer treatments. Principal investigator Zoltan Szallasi, MD of Boston Children s Hospital, and colleagues are being funded to study two proteins that may help doctors forecast which patients with BRCA-associated cancers would respond best to PARP inhibitors and which to platinum-based therapy.   BRCA proteins, which are made from BRCA genes, typically help in the repair of DNA damage that occurs in a cell s life. There are other proteins, such as SIRT2, that regulate how BRCA proteins perform this role in the cell. Principal investigator David Yu, MD, PhD, of Emory University, and colleagues are funded to determine the significance of SIRT2 s regulation over BRCA1 protein activity and whether inhibiting SIRT2 might kill cells and tumors with BRCA1/2 dysregulation.   Principal investigator Katherine Crew, MD, of Columbia University, and colleagues have received a grant to develop a web-based decision aid on BRCA genetic testing for Orthodox Jewish women, many of whom have an increased risk of having a BRCA mutation. Based on preliminary surveys, over three-quarters of this population have not yet considered genetic testing or stated that they will not be tested. The project will result in the development of RealRisks, a decision-making tool designed to overcome cultural barriers to BRCA genetic testing and increase risk-appropriate cancer screening and prevention strategies. In addition to these innovation grants, The Basser Team Science Award (a two year grant) was awarded last year to a multi-institutional team led by Junjie Chen, PhD, of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The team is being funded to study new mechanisms of chemotherapy responsiveness in BRCA-related cancers and overcoming therapy resistance arising from these mechanisms. The research aims to develop more effective treatment strategies for patients with BRCA mutations. The External Grants Program is made possible by a $5 million donation in 2014 by University of Pennsylvania alumni Mindy and Jon Gray. Their total giving to Penn is $30 million, following a $25 million gift that established the Basser Center in 2012. The Center was created in memory of Mindy Gray s sister Faith Basser, who died of BRCA-related ovarian cancer at age 44.  We continue to be extremely grateful to the Grays for their generosity in supporting these national research programs once again,  said Domchek.  Their gift allows Penn Medicine to continue its commitment toward improving treatment options and quality of life for these patients, regardless of where the research originates. This is a progressive approach to research funding that we at the Basser Center are enormously proud to be part of. ","Published: October 8, 2015"

Almost 12 million patients are given heparin annually either as treatment for clots or to prevent clot formation, for example, during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.   A team from the lab of Mark Greene, MD, PhD, the John W. Eckman Professor of Medical Science, including Zheng Cai, PhD, senior research investigator, as well as the lab of Douglas Cines, MD, director of the Coagulation Laboratory and a professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, solved the crystal structure of the pathogenic immune complex and elucidated the structural basis by which another, potentially therapeutic, antibody disrupts this structure.HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) is an autoimmune blood disorder caused by complexes that form among these components: platelet factor 4 (PF4), which is released when platelets are activated; heparin; and antibodies to PF4. As many as one percent of patients who receive a certain type of heparin for at least five days develop HIT. These patients make antibodies that bind to the heparin-PF4 complex. These antibodies in turn trigger platelets to form clumps. These aggregates, along with other cells, cause blood clots to form, leading to an overall decrease in platelets. About half of all patients with HIT also develop arterial or venous clotting, which is often recurrent and can be deadly or require amputation. Current therapy with intense and irreversible anticoagulation lowers the risk of recurrence, but the risk of limb loss and death remain high and the risk of bleeding as a result of therapy is considerable. HIT can be difficult to diagnosis definitely, leading to many patients receiving this high-risk therapy unnecessarily. This treatment conundrum has prompted the search for new ways to treat HIT. Deconstructing to Construct The team started their hunt by detailing the structure of the components of the antigen-antibody complex at the root of HIT. First, they solved the crystal structure of PF4 in the presence of a critical part of the heparin molecule. In the blood, PF4 molecules can exist singly as monomers, doubly as dimers, and as a four-part complex called a tetramer, which have an  open  end and a  closed  end. Their new crystal structure showed that heparin bound to the  closed  end of the PF4 tetramer, which stabilized the tetramer. They next solved the crystal structure of PF4 in complex with a pathogenic antibody called KKO. Developed by coauthor Gowthami Arepally at Duke University, with coauthors Mortimer Poncz and Lubica Raouva, from The Children s Hospital of Philadelphia, KKO causes a HIT-like disease in a mouse model. This crystal structure revealed that KKO bound to the  open  end of the stabilized tetramers, making contact with three out of four monomers in the tetramer. This helped to explain the requirement for heparin as a backbone for the complex. This finding provides new insight into how a normal host protein, in this case PF4, can be converted into a target of the host immune system, leading to the development of an autoimmune disorder. They studied a second antibody developed by Arepally, called RTO, which also binds to PF4, but does not cause a HIT-like disease. They found that in the crystal structure of PF4 in complex with RTO, this antibody bound to PF4 monomers rather than tetramers. More importantly, RTO binds to PF4 monomers in a way that the team predicted would prevent PF4 monomers from combining into tetramers. They then confirmed that RTO prevented formation of antigenic complexes, activation of platelets by KKO and by human HIT antibodies in cell experiments. The researchers also prevented clot formation caused by KKO in a mouse model of HIT. The upshot of this sequence of experiments is that binding of RTO to PF4 monomers prevents formation, and indeed disrupts, pathogenic complexes that are central to the pathology of HIT. The investigators believe that the antibody RTO will provide the basis for new diagnostics and may pave the way for a therapy to stop the disorder early in its progression.","Published: October 8, 2015"

In addition, rhythmic degradation of clockwork proteins is also crucial. However, surprisingly, researchers know little about these specific processes. A new Penn-led study describes a new genome screen that identified partner molecules of cell-waste disposal proteins. The team led byJohn Hogenesch, PhD, a professor of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics in the Perelman School of Medicine at University of Pennsylvania and Jason DeBruyne, PhD, a former postdoctoral fellow in the Hogenesch lab and now an assistant professor at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, applied their new method to identifying other clock partners that target a multipurpose cell nucleus receptor for disposal.   Our goal was not really to study clock biology,  said senior author Hogenesch.  Rather, our aim was to develop a genome-wide screen to identify key players involved in protein stability and breakdown.  The proteins they were looking for are called ligases. These recognize specific proteins and direct the addition of a molecule onto waste proteins to dispatch the protein to be recycled to the proteosome. This is the cell compartment that breaks up used proteins into its basic amino acids.  To validate the screen, the team tagged several of their favorite clock proteins with a short protein tag that s easily recognized by antibodies. The team then used high throughput imaging to see what ligases increase and decrease the levels of their favorite clock proteins in cells. They found that the ligase Fbxl3 was a regulator of Cry proteins, critical components of the core clock. They also found that a protein called Seven in absentia 2 (Siah2) is a key regulator of the turnover of a well-studied, clock nuclear protein called RevErb  on a 24-hour cycle. Certain ligases, like Fbxl3, can be targeted with small molecules.  These ligases are being actively developed in drug discovery efforts,  Hogenesch noted.  Most proteins don t bind with small molecules. With this screen, we may be able to overcome that limitation by finding the ligase that regulates their levels and function. Small molecules against the ligase, then, could indirectly regulate the amount and therefore activity of the  undruggable  protein.  The researchers hope that by applying this new method, more ligase drug targets can be found and developed into new therapies across the spectrum of health challenges. ","Published: October 8, 2015"

Currently, studies investigating breast cell behaviour often use rodent models.  The team will provide an alternative lab based gel to mimic human breast tissue. This will allow breast cell models to be grown in the lab and to help the researchers understand the influence of the breast matrix in breast cancer progression. The hydrogel technology was developed at The University of Manchester.  The initial interdisciplinary development of the gel was funded from grants from UMI3, the University s innovation company, as well as the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.  The team started working together after inter-faculty networking sessions highlighted their complementary expertise.One of the developers who will be working on the new project is Dr Cathy Merry, now of the University of Nottingham. She said:  By developing a bespoke gel which can be programmed to behave in the same way as human breast tissue we will be able to investigate how cancers are influenced by the adjacent normal cells and the non-cellular stroma without the need to use animals.   Currently non-animal tumour models poorly represent the complex environment experienced by cancer cells but the approach planned with this gel has the potential to replicate the cancer environment seen in humans.  The gels will be produced in collaboration with The University of Manchester s Dr Gillian Farnie andProfessor Tony Howell, who provide expertise in primary breast cell culture, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and breast ECM/density.   Dr Farnie said:  There is strong evidence showing the development of breast cancers is influenced by interactions between breast tissue and cells within the breast.   The protein and sugar components of breast tissue are different in normal and cancer samples and these changes occur in the early stages of breast cancer development such as ductal carcinoma in-situ.  Our preliminary evidence indicates that the innovative hydrogel technology will enable us to manipulate the environment of pre-cancers to determine the exact mechanism of the interactions which we believe will lead to new ways to treat and prevent breast cancers.  As well as replicating aspects of the complex mixture of proteins that embed and support cells, the hydrogel will also be manipulated to mimic breast density   a key predictor of breast cancer recurrence and development.   Professor Howell added:  The synthetic hydrogels allow us to manipulate the matrix environment and density to measure the response of pre-cancerous breast cells. The advance is that complex interactions can now be studied in a highly systematic and reproducible way.  Understanding the interactions will potentially lead to new approaches to breast cancer prevention and treatment. Thankfully these experiments are now possible without animal models thus saving animals and on expense.   The research team believe this research will also pave the way for further hydrogels which mimic alternative tissues which could then be used for other solid cancers.","Published: October 8, 2015"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/tolerant-immune-system-increases-cancer-risk-212172,Tolerant Immune System Increases Cancer Risk Researchers have found that individuals with high immunoCRIT ratios may have an increased risk of developing certain cancers   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. For a malignant tumor to form, cancer cells must evade the immune system's attack. Numerous studies have already shown that cancer spreads particularly aggressively if there is an unfavorable balance between suppressing and active immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. ""But we didn't know whether this is a consequence of an aggressive tumor or rather its cause,"" says Rudolf Kaaks, epidemiologist at the German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, DKFZ). Kaaks and his co-workers had a unique opportunity to pursue this question: The DKFZ in Heidelberg is one of the study centers of the EPIC study, which investigates the links between diet and cancer in almost half a million people in the whole of Europe. In the initial EPIC examinations from 1996 to 1998, blood samples were taken from all study participants and subsequently frozen. From the 25,000 participants in Heidelberg, the researchers now picked the blood samples from about 1,000 individuals who had developed cancer in the course of the observation period (lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer). Their control group consisted of 800 participants who were not affected by a malignancy. Sebastian Dietmar Barth and his colleagues from Kaak's department counted the suppressing regulatory T cells in the blood samples and determined the ratio of these cells to the total number of T cells, which also comprises the tumor-fighting cells. This ratio is called ""immunoCRIT"". As a rule, it holds true that the higher it is, the more the immune system is suppressed. When comparing the cancer risk of EPIC participants with extremely high or extremely low immunoCRIT, the researchers found that if the value is strongly increased, the lung cancer risk rises by 100 percent, and the risk of colon cancer by approximately 60 percent. Women with very high immunoCRIT even have a triple increase in their risk of developing estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer*. Here, however, the researchers think that for a definite statement the case number might be too low. In cases of prostate cancer and estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer, the DKFZ epidemiologists found no links between immunoCRIT and cancer risk. When the tumor-fighting T cells are kept in check by inhibitory regulatory T cells, scientists speak of ""peripheral immune tolerance"". ""With this study, we have demonstrated for the first time that the unfavorable ratio of immune cells already prevailed long before the onset of the disease,"" Kaaks says. ""Hence it is more likely to be the cause than the result of cancer."" The DKFZ researchers conducted this study in collaboration with Epiontis, a Berlin-based company that specializes in the epigenetic tests that were used to determine the ratio of the various T cell populations. The scientists do not yet know why immune tolerance has an effect on certain cancer risks. A possible explanation may be that, according to prior research findings, tumors of the lung and bowel tend to be colonized by particularly high quantities of immune cells. The Heidelberg epidemiologists now plan to extend their investigation to other types of tumor. * Breast cancer whose cells exhibit no receptor proteins for the female sex hormone estrogen.","Published: October 8, 2015"

New research from the Australian Research Council Centre of excellence in advanced Molecular imaging has shown the proof is in the picture. And this proof may have implications for type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease   the body s immune system mistakenly attacks its own cells, leading to the inability to produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels in the blood. Now, an unexpected discovery about how these immune cells work at the atomic level may provide avenues to investigate new mechanisms able to short-circuit the inappropriate immune response in patients with type 1 diabetes.When microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses invade the body, the immune system elicits a response that ensures they are engulfed and destroyed. Central to this response is the molecular-level interaction between the surface receptors of white blood cells (T cells) and immune molecules known as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Basically, a cell signals to a T cell that it is infected and the T cells mount a broad immune attack in the area of the infection. Until now, the assumption has been that the receptors on the T cells (TCRs) must bind to MHC in a specific orientation in order to trigger a signal to the immune system. A team of researchers, led by Professor Jamie Rossjohn at Monash University, has succeeded in turning current immunology on its head, demonstrating for the first time that TCRs can bind with a completely reversed orientation   compared to all previously studied receptors. Using the national Synchrotron, the team has investigated TCRs associated with a particular type of T cell   a regulatory T cell (Treg)   that prevents the body from attacking its own insulin-producing cells.  We like to call Treg cells  peacekeeping  cells. They come about to stop the inflammatory response (once infections have been cleared) and false alarms that occur in autoimmune diseases. In type 1 diabetes there are not enough of these peacekeeping cells and so the immune system continues to attack and destroy insulin-secreting cells,  says Dr Hugh Reid, a co-author of the paper.  Our atomic snapshots show that TCRs still function when they interact with MHC in a completely different orientation.  Individuals with type 1 diabetes are thought to have a reduced number of the peacekeeping cells. This subsequently triggers an unhelpful immune response in the pancreas, where insulin protein is produced. Using a fragment of this protein and an MHC molecule, the researchers stimulated the production of the peacekeeping cells needed by patients with type 1 diabetes, and they discovered   along with collaborators Tony Tiganis, Monash University and Bart Roep, Leiden University  that despite the reversed mode of connection, the cell still suppressed the attacking response in the presence of insulin. This  fixed  orientation of TCR recognition has always been put down to natural selection within the immune system s evolution and immunologists have strongly believed for T cells to be activated they must  dock  in this fashion. Challenging this conventional understanding of the fixed orientation of TCRs suggests that all types of T cells could be capable of connecting with MHC in completely different ways. The findings challenge established views and open up many exciting opportunities for further research. Of particular interest is that, despite the TCRs  reversed orientation, the Treg cells are still functional, suppressing the immune response when necessary.  We will now set out to determine more TCR- MHC interactions of the same regulatory T cell subset and compare them to the other T cell TCR-MHC interactions derived from the inflammatory T cells,  reveals Reid.","Published: October 8, 2015"

Their new approach promises to support the development of rapid, low-cost antibody detection at the point-of-care, eliminating the treatment initiation delays and increasing healthcare costs associated with current techniques. The binding of the antibody to the DNA machine causes a structural change (or switch), which generates a light signal. The sensor does not need to be chemically activated and is rapid   acting within five minutes   enabling the targeted antibodies to be easily detected, even in complex clinical samples such as blood serum. One of the advantages of our approach is that it is highly versatile,  said Prof. Francesco Ricci, of the University of Rome, Tor Vergata, senior co-author of the study.  This DNA nanomachine can be in fact custom-modified so that it can detect a huge range of antibodies, this makes our platform adaptable for many different diseases .  Our modular platform provides significant advantages over existing methods for the detection of antibodies,  added Prof. Vall e-B lisle of the University of Montreal, the other senior co-author of the paper.  It is rapid, does not require reagent chemicals, and may prove to be useful in a range of different applications such as point-of-care diagnostics and bioimaging .  Another nice feature of our platform is its low-cost,  said Prof. Kevin Plaxco of the University of California, Santa Barbara.  The materials needed for one assay cost about 15 cents, making our approach very competitive in comparison with other quantitative approaches.   We are excited by these preliminary results, but we are looking forward to improve our sensing platform even more  said Simona Ranallo, a PhD student in the group of Prof. Ricci at the University of Rome and first-author of the paper.  For example, we could adapt our platform so that the signal of the nanoswitch may be read using a mobile phone. This will make our approach really available to anyone! We are working on this idea and we would like to start involving diagnostic companies. ","Published: October 8, 2015"

One of these responses, known as the SOS response, results in an increase in the rate of DNA mutation. Given that DNA mutation is a fundamental trait of evolution, many people have speculated that the stimulation of this response helps contribute to the increased resistance to antibiotics in bacteria over time. 'Antibiotic resistance is a big health problem that s been highlighted recently by the Prime Minister and the Chief Medical Officer,' points out Professor Craig MacLean from the Department of Zoology, who led the research. 'So it s important that we understand exactly how it s evolving.' His team has now carried out a series of experiments to investigate the relationship between antibiotics and the SOS pathway, and how it affects the fitness of bacteria and their evolution of antibiotic resistance. Studying two strains of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa   one normal, the other engineered to never activate the SOS response   the team carried out studies exposing them to non-lethal doses of an antibiotic known as ciprofloxacin. The team found that, in the presence of the antibiotic, those bacteria that could activate the SOS response have a short-term advantage, reproducing more effectively because some of the genes activated during the defence process act to repair damaged DNA. However, when the researchers came to study the evolution of the bacteria over 200 generations, they found no evidence to suggest that the SOS response accelerated the evolution of resistance, with both the natural and engineered types of bacteria performing equally. In fact, the team observed that the activation of the SOS response actually became less pronounced from generation to generation as the evolution of antibiotic resistance progressed. 'The stress response pathways provide short-term protection against antibiotics,' explains Professor MacLean. 'But what this shows is that they don t accelerate the evolution of antibiotic resistance. The fairly modest increase in the mutation rate associated with SOS response seems to be offset by a decrease in the effective strength of selection for increased resistance at a population level.' The team suggests that the finding may change the way people approach solutions to overcoming antibiotic resistance. 'Many of the antibiotics we use are becoming useless because of bacterial resistance,' explains Professor MacLean. 'One approach to the problem that people have suggested is the development of drugs that block the SOS response, to make it harder for the bacteria to evolve resistance. Our research suggests scepticism towards that approach.' Professor MacLean s team is now working to establish which other mechanisms might be responsible for the evolutionary development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics.","Published: October 8, 2015"

The agreement is potentially worth over  50 million to Horizon in preclinical and clinical milestones, payments linked to net sales, and tiered royalties on future product sales. Horizon has in-licensed novel kinase inhibitors from Servier that exhibit great promise based on pre-clinical data for treatment of a range of cancer types but do not currently have a biomarker to define a sensitive patient population. Horizon will use its world-leading platform, comprising isogenic cell lines and in vivo models, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing technology and ultra-high-throughput combination screening, to identify the population of cancer patients most likely to respond to the in-licensed compounds, whether as single agents or in combinations with other drugs. Horizon also has the option to explore the use of the inhibitors in other therapeutic indications. Under the terms of the agreement, Servier has a first option to license back the assets. Should Servier take up this option, Horizon would receive up to  50 million in milestone payments plus royalties on product sales. If Servier does not take up its option, Horizon will be free to seek another pharma partner and Horizon and Servier would then share in the success of the progression of the programme as it advances into the clinic and registration. Horizon will evaluate the mechanism of action of the candidate compounds, and will verify the patient stratification hypothesis by both in vitro and in vivo preclinical experiments. Horizon will also define a path towards the development of biomarkers for both patient stratification and drug efficacy. Dr. Darrin M. Disley, Chief Executive Officer of Horizon Discovery Group plc, said:  The in-license of assets with a strong pre-clinical pedigree but do not yet have a clear clinical development strategy, represents a great opportunity for companies like Horizon.

The medical campus of Wayne State University (because of its close ties to the DMC) is the largest single site medical campus in the United States. Work using Raman spectroscopy is situated within the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, under faculty member Dr Abhilash Pandya and his colleagues Dr Brady King and Dr Luke Reisner. One of the various diseases being studied using Raman spectroscopy is Hirschsprung's disease, a bowel disease. The objective of Dr King and his colleagues is to develop Raman spectroscopy for use in clinical applications. The ultimate goal is to have this type of technology available in the operating room for accurate, real-time diagnosis of tissue during operations. Describing the choice of the Renishaw inVia system for his work, Dr King said:  It is well suited for a pathological workflow. Its accurate staging and imaging have allowed us to capture spectra from a wide range of tissue samples quickly and easily. While we also use a more compact Raman probe system for preliminary in vivo work, the inVia provides a much higher spectral resolution. Additionally, the microscope and movable stage allow us to capture our spectra more quickly and easily. While the inVia is not intended for in vivo use, which is our ultimate goal, it does give these benefits while providing a potentially suitable replacement or augmentation of typical pathological analysis.

By its nature, however, the brain cannot be palpated without using a highly invasive procedure (craniotomy, or opening the skull), which is limited to rare cases. By drawing on seismology, INSERM (Institut national de la sant  et de la recherche m dicale) researchers led by St fan Catheline have just developed a noninvasive brain imaging method using MRI that provides the same information as physical palpation. Ultimately, it could be used in the early diagnosis of brain tumors or Alzheimer's disease. Many diseases involve structural changes in tissues, which are reflected in a change in their mechanical properties, such as elasticity. Using the sensitivity of their hands, and their detailed knowledge of the body, physicians, through an examination known as palpation, can assess the size and stiffness of a tumor, the presence of inflamed lymph nodes, or the size and position of the fetus in a pregnant woman, to mention a few examples. This palpation has been supplemented or replaced by modern techniques that give the physician an indication of the elasticity of a biological tissue. They are based on the generation and detection of waves that propagate through the body at varying speeds depending on the stiffness of the organs (the stiffer the tissue, the slower the wave propagation, and vice versa). However, this method cannot be applied to the brain, which, doubly protected by the cranium and cerebrospinal fluid, is difficult for externally applied waves to access. It is therefore impossible to directly or indirectly palpate the brain, something that greatly complicates the work of neurosurgeons. On the other hand, the brain is the seat of natural vibrations created by the blood pulsating in the arteries and the circulating cerebrospinal fluid. There remained a significant unprecedented challenge: how to capture this complex field of natural shear waves, and represent it on a computer screen. In this article, Inserm researchers, using MRI, have succeeded in detecting natural shear waves in the brain using computational techniques borrowed from seismologists and known as ""noise correlation."" They were thus able to build images of the brain's elasticity. ""If this method can be developed for clinical use, it will be a boon for both the patient and the physician, since making the brain vibrate is quite painful at the moment. Of course, this method will be complementary to those that already exist, and the future is in a multimodal medical diagnosis,"" says St fan Catheline, Inserm Research Director and main author of this work. ""Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and hydrocephalus involve changes in the stiffness of the brain tissues. This new technique allows their detection, and could be used to avoid brain biopsies.

Lowering body temperature a therapy known as induced hypothermia did not improve patients' chances of recovery, the study showed. Doctors say the therapy may increase patients' risk of death and disability and should not be used to treat traumatic brain injuries. Cooling the brain helps to reduce the build-up of pressure inside the head, which is strongly linked to long-term disability and death following head injury. The treatment is widely used in some intensive care units in Europe and North America, but there have been few clinical trials to assess the effects on patients' long-term recovery. The major international study led by the University of Edinburgh tracked the outcomes of almost 400 cases of traumatic brain injuries from 18 different countries. Around half of the patients were treated with standard procedures. The other half were treated with induced hypothermia to try to protect the brain from further damage caused by swelling. The team found that induced hypothermia was successful at reducing the build-up of pressure in the skull after head injury. Six months later, however, patients who had received the therapy were more likely to fare worse than those treated with standard care. Favorable outcomes, ranging from moderate disability to good recovery, occurred in only a quarter of the patients in the hypothermia group compared with more than a third of patients in the control group. Doctors ended the trial early because of fears that the therapy may cause harm to some patients. Two million people experience a traumatic brain injury worldwide each year, mostly as a result of a road accidents or falls. The condition claims 50,000 lives and causes 80,000 people to suffer long-term disability. Induced hypothermia involves cooling the body between two and five degrees below normal body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. Patients are given ice cold intravenous drips within 10 days of their accident. They are kept cool using either cold water blankets or cooling pads for at least 48 hours, after which they are gradually re-warmed to normal body temperature. The results of the Eurotherm3235 trial are published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research's Health Technology Assessment Programme.

ARMD is a common eye problem caused by the loss of cones. Bernier's team has developed a highly effective in vitro technique for producing light sensitive retina cells from human embryonic stem cells.  Our method has the capacity to differentiate 80% of the stem cells into pure cones,  Professor Gilbert explained.  Within 45 days, the cones that we allowed to grow towards confluence spontaneously formed organised retinal tissue that was 150 microns thick. This has never been achieved before.  In order to verify the technique, Bernier injected clusters of retinal cells into the eyes of healthy mice. The transplanted photoreceptors migrated naturally within the retina of their host.  Cone transplant represents a therapeutic solution for retinal pathologies caused by the degeneration of photoreceptor cells,  Bernier explained.  To date, it has been difficult to obtain great quantities of human cones.  His discovery offers a way to overcome this problem, offering hope that treatments may be developed for currently non-curable degenerative diseases, like Stargardt disease and ARMD.  Researchers have been trying to achieve this kind of trial for years,  he said.  Thanks to our simple and effective approach, any laboratory in the world will now be able to create masses of photoreceptors. Even if there's a long way to go before launching clinical trials, this means, in theory, that will be eventually be able to treat countless patients.  The findings are particularly significant in the light of improving life expectancies and the associated increase in cases of ARMD. ARMD is in fact the greatest cause of blindness amongst people over the age of 50 and affects millions of people worldwide. And as we age, it is more and more difficult to avoid   amongst people over 80, this accelerated aging of the retina affects nearly one in four. People with ARMD gradually lose their perception of colours and details to the point that they can no longer read, write, watch television or even recognize a face. ARMD is due to the degeneration of the macula, which is the central part of the retina that enables the majority of eyesight. This degeneration is caused by the destruction of the cones and cells in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a tissue that is responsible for the reparation of the visual cells in the retina and for the elimination of cells that are too worn out. However, there is only so much reparation that can be done as we are born with a fixed number of cones. They therefore cannot naturally be replaced. Moreover, as we age, the RPE's maintenance is less and less effective   waste accumulates, forming deposits.  Differentiating RPE cells is quite easy. But in order to undertake a complete therapy, we need neuronal tissue that links all RPE cells to the cones. That is much more complex to develop,  Bernier explains, noting nonetheless that he believes his research team is up to the challenge. Bernier has been interested in the genes that code and enable the induction of the retina during embryonic development since completing his PhD in Molecular Biology in 1997.  During my post-doc at the Max-Planck Institute in Germany, I developed the idea that there was a natural molecule that must exist and be capable of forcing embryonic stem cells into becoming cones,  he said. Indeed, bioinformatic analysis led him to predict the existence of a mysterious protein: COCO, a  recombinational  human molecule that is normally expressed within photoreceptors during their development. In 2001, he launched his laboratory at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital and immediately isolated the molecule. But it took several years of research to demystify the molecular pathways involved in the photoreceptors development mechanism. His latest research shows that in order to create cones, COCO can systematically block all the signalling pathways leading to the differentiation of the other retinal cells in the eye. It's by uncovering this molecular process that Bernier was able to produce photoreceptors. More specifically, he has produced S-cones, which are photoreceptor prototypes that are found in the most primitive organisms. Beyond the clinical applications, Professor Bernier's findings could enable the modelling of human retinal degenerative diseases through the use of induced pluripotent stem cells, offering the possibility of directly testing potential avenues for therapy on the patient's own tissues.

In studies designed to better understand how the brain processes information, scientists led by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Associate Professor Glenn Turner have identified an important component in these circuits: the point at which incoming sensory information begins to be transformed into a neural signal that instructs a fly's response. The cells, called mushroom body output neurons (MBONs), appear to distill nuanced information about an odor into clear instructions: approach or flee. By genetically labeling and following the activity of the same MBONs in multiple flies (there are precisely 34 in each brain, situated in known locations), the scientists found that each cell had a characteristic response pattern in each individual.  The pattern, in other words, differed between flies. This suggests that MBONs may underlie individual odor preferences that develop as flies learn to associate smells with positive or negative experiences. Mushroom body output neurons were discovered last year by Turner's collaborators, Gerald Rubin and Yoshinori Aso, at the Janelia Research Campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. As their name implies, the cells are located in the mushroom body, a part of the fruit fly brain critical for learned responses to sensory stimuli. The mushroom body itself is composed of roughly 2000 neurons that transmit information about smells that have been detected by the fly's sensory neurons   and on the receiving end of these transmissions are just 34 MBONs. A fly's behavioral response to an odor depends on the message that these output neurons relay to neurons farther along the circuit. Toshihide Hige, a postdoctoral researcher in Turner's lab, measured how MBONs responded to 10 different smells an assortment of potentially enticing food smells, like yeast and vinegar; aversive smells such as citronella; and more neutral aromas. Responses varied greatly between cells, with each cell most strongly attuned to certain aromas. Each colored dot in these two boxes registers the activity of a neuron in the mushroom body of the fly brain to a variety of odors presented to a living fly (odors are color-coded). The box labeled KC shows how Kenyon cells register odors. There are about 2000 such cells in the mushroom body, and they receive from other fly brain cells information about odors the fly is sensing. Clumping of the dots into discrete  clouds  of the same color indicate that KC cells enable the fly to identify different smells. MBONs, in the box to the right, receive signals from the Kenyon cells, but provide the fly with a different kind of information. There are 3  clumps  of dots. The blue/magenta dots in the lower right are responses to odors from desirable foods; the red and brown dots on the far left show responses to repellent odors. The large middle clump represents response to neutral smells. Turner s team proposes that MBONs provide flies with simple information about whether a smell is good (lower right) or bad (far left), part of the decision about whether to pursue or flee.  When the team analyzed the cells' responses, some patterns emerged. In general, food smells elicited response patterns that were distinct from those elicited by repellant odors, suggesting that although mushroom body output cells probably don t identify specific odors, they may communicate each odor's most essential quality whether it is  good  or  bad.  This can be the basis for action   to pursue the odor or fly away from it. In each fly, pairs of matched MBONs on opposite hemispheres of the fly brain, which could be identified both genetically and anatomically, shared the same response patterns. But when the scientists examined the corresponding cells in a different fly, they exhibited a whole new pattern of activity. That suggested that MBON sensitivities had been established through the past experiences of the individual flies being examined.  As a fly lives its life and encounters a bunch of different odors, that olfactory experience may induce some plasticity in the circuit,  Turner says, explaining that this could allow a fly's brain to adjust olfactory preferences. To explore this idea, the team repeated their experiments, this time in flies that lacked a memory-related gene called rutabaga. MBONs in these learning-impaired flies still fired in response to odors, but the individuality of each cell's response was lost. Activity patterns of each cell looked more or less the same in different animals.  It looks like plasticity -- the result of particular experiences -- is driving each of these output neurons to their own particular response properties, which are different for each individual fly,  Turner says. These fly-to-fly differences in cell signaling reflect differences in olfactory preferences that are present not just in fruit flies, but also in humans, Turner notes.  We all have slightly different olfactory perceptions. I kind of hate the smell of durians [a tropical fruit], but my wife really likes the smell of durians. One person's perfume is another person's horrible stench.  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory   Original reporting by: Jennifer Michalowski Turner GC et al.

His findings are the result of a study that will be published in November's Consciousness and Cognition. ""We knew that repeating aloud was good for memory, but this is the first study to show that if it is done in a context of communication, the effect is greater in terms of information recall,  Boucher explained. To demonstrate this, Boucher and Alexis Lafleur asked 44 French-speaking university students to read a series of lexemes on a screen. A lexeme is a word such as it is found in a dictionary. During the task, the participants wore headphones that emitted ""white noise"" to mask their own voices and eliminate auditory feedback. The subjects were submitted to four experimental conditions: repeating in their head, repeating silently while moving their lips, repeating aloud while looking at the screen, and finally, repeating aloud while addressing someone. After a distraction task, they were asked to identify the lexemes they recalled having said from a list that included lexemes not used in the test. The results show a clear difference when the exercise was performed aloud in the presence of someone else, even though the participants had heard absolutely nothing. Repeating in one's head without gesturing was the least effective way to recall information.  The simple fact of articulating without making a sound creates a sensorimotor link that increases our ability to remember, but if it is related to the functionality of speech, we remember even more,  Boucher said. Previous studies conducted at Professor Boucher's Phonetic Sciences Laboratory have shown that when we articulate a sound, we create a sensory and motor reference in our brain, by moving our mouth and feeling our vocal chords vibrate.  The production of one or more sensory aspects allows for more efficient recall of the verbal element. But the added effect of talking to someone shows that in addition to the sensorimotor aspects related to verbal expression, the brain refers to the multisensory information associated with the communication episode,  Boucher explained.  The result is that the information is better retained in memory.  Evoking one's memory of sensory episodes is in part the phenomenon to which French writer Marcel Proust alluded when he referred to  the madeleines of his childhood.  The texture and flavor of these little cakes rekindled in him an emotional connection that reminded him of his mother. But what do we keep in memory? How does episodic and multisensory memory work? These questions are at the heart of Professor Boucher's work. Challenging the formal approaches in linguistics, particularly the analysis of spoken language through writing, he has endeavored for several years to build bridges between his discipline and neuroscience. Lafleur, a former student who is now a doctoral student in neuropsychology, and Boucher conducted another experiment.  This time, we used sequences of syllables that do not form lexemes in French, i.e., non-words,  said the professor. As the researchers expected, their data showed no difference between the various experimental conditions. Subjects did not recall the sequences of  non-words  any better   whether they produced them aloud, silently, or when speaking to someone.  According to the professor, the fact that the information cannot be grafted to verbal elements in memory and involving a sensory reference explains the absence of effects between the conditions of production.  The results of our research confirm the importance of motor sensory experiences in memory retention and help to better define sensory episodes associated with verbal expression,"" Boucher concluded.

The Early Independence Awards, established in 2011, allow creative early-career scientists to leapfrog the traditional postdoctoral training period by providing funding of up to $250,000 per year for five years to conduct independent investigation in their own laboratories. They are one of four awards issued by the High-Risk, High-Reward Research program, which is supported by the NIH Common Fund. In all, 78 awards were announced today for  exceptional investigators pursuing bold research projects.   This program has consistently produced research that revolutionized scientific fields by giving investigators the freedom to take risks and explore potentially groundbreaking concepts,  said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.  We look forward to the remarkable advances in biomedical research the 2015 awardees will make.   This is a wonderful honor that will help to expand the scope of my work on this high-risk project, both to achieve my goals and to follow new avenues of research as they come up,  said Dr. Israelsen, a Sara and Frank McKnight Independent Postdoctoral Fellow who arrived at UT Southwestern in January.  I also want to thank the Chair of the Department of Biochemistry, Dr. Steven McKnight, the many other Biochemistry faculty members who have provided mentorship, and the McKnight Fellowship for helping launch this project.  The McKnight Fellowship is named in honor of the parents of Dr. McKnight, who conducted similar independent research at the start of his career at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. The McKnight Fellowship provides funding to enable recipients such as Dr. Israelsen to conduct independent research.  It is fantastic that he will receive one of the NIH Early Independence Awards,  said Dr. McKnight, who holds the Distinguished Chair in Basic Biomedical Research and The Sam G. Winstead and F. Andrew Bell Distinguished Chair in Biochemistry.  The competition for these awards is fierce. This accomplishment brings honor to Dr. Israelsen, the Department of Biochemistry, and UT Southwestern as an institution.  As a graduate student conducting research on cancer biology, Dr. Israelsen had a conversation with another Ph.D. candidate that changed his research focus.  We were talking about ways we could gain a better understanding of the hyperactive metabolism of growing cancer cells, which divide very quickly. Hibernation came up as a counterexample,  he explained.  The idea was to look up how animals shut down metabolism during hibernation, and then use that information to understand how cancer cells regulate their metabolic pathways.  He began to research hibernation and soon realized that none of the questions he was interested in studying had been answered.  At that point, I was hooked,  he said. Dr. Israelsen grew up in North Logan, Utah, and graduated from Utah State University with degrees in biology and economics before earning his doctorate in biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In his downtime, he enjoys relaxing with his wife, Lora, and outdoor activities such as camping and working on the family cars.","Published: October 7, 2015"

Using new capabilities within XCMS, a data analysis platform developed in the Siuzdak lab, the researchers observed small molecules transforming and even disappearing during an experiment meant to mimic the GC-MS process, throwing into question the nature of the data being generated by GC-MS.A Closer Look at GC-MS For more than 50 years, chemists and biologists have used GC-MS to identify and measure concentrations of small molecules. When a sample is injected in a GC-MS system, it is heated and vaporized. The vapor travels through a gas chromatography column and the molecules separate, allowing the mass spectrometer to measure the individual molecules in the sample. Today, GC-MS is widely used in thousands of laboratories for tasks such as chemical analysis, disease diagnosis, environmental monitoring and even forensic investigations. The new experiments were initiated when Siuzdak was preparing a short course for students at the American Society for Mass Spectrometry annual meeting. The question arose of how heat from the GC-MS vaporization process could affect results, so Siuzdak and TSRI Research Associate Mingliang Fang ran a set of experiments to compare how small molecules responded to thermal stress. To their surprise, the molecular profiles of as many as 40 percent of the molecules were altered, suggesting that heat from the GC-MS process could dramatically change the chemical composition of the samples.  The results were quite astounding as this is a technology that has been used for decades,  said Siuzdak. The finding led the researchers to take a closer look at how molecules degrade and transform during GC-MS. Heat Transforms Molecules The scientists analyzed small molecule metabolites heated at 60, 100 and 250 degrees Celsius to mimic sample preparation and analysis conditions. The team used XCMS combined with a low-temperature liquid chromatography mass spectrometry technology which has been previously shown not to degrade molecules thermally, to determine the extent of the thermal effects. The researchers observed significant degradation even at the lower temperatures. At the higher temperatures, almost half of the molecules were degraded or completely transformed.  In retrospect, there was very little to be surprised about: heat degrades molecules,  said Siuzdak.  However we ve simply taken for granted the extent of thermal degradation. While this is a negative result and scientists rarely publish them, I felt compelled especially for the students just getting started in their careers to report the limitation of such a ubiquitous technology.  The researchers noted that even molecules not typically observed in GC-MS can also be transformed; for example, the energy metabolite adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was readily converted into adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This transformation is relevant for medical research because scientists often use a heating process to look at the ratio of ATP to AMP in cells to estimate the function of cellular components in aging and disease.  People use this ratio to detect disease, but if the ratio can be changed by the heating process, the results will not be accurate,  said Fang.  It is known that ATP is thermally sensitive, but not how it changed under these conditions.  Thermal degradation could also explain why many scientists have detected many unknown molecular  peaks  in the past. Based on the new study, the researchers now believe these metabolites may be byproducts of the heating process the result of reactions between metabolites as they degrade. The Next Step So why hadn t scientists figured out the effect of heating until now? Siuzdak explained that while some scientists had noticed changes in specific metabolites, it was difficult to see changes in overall molecular profiles that contain thousands of molecules. This omic-based study was made possible by new capabilities within the XCMS program developed at the TSRI Scripps Center for Metabolomics. XCMS is a free, cloud-based data analysis technology used to analyze mass spectrometry data all over the globe.  With XCMS, we could expand our study to obtain a global profile of how the metabolites were altered not just a few compounds,  said Fang.  Fortunately these problems can be overcome with the use of standards in GC-MS as well as using newer, ambient temperature mass spectrometry technologies, and this report will likely stimulate more scientists to move to these less destructive alternatives,  said Siuzdak.","Published: October 7, 2015"

In it, the experts argue that  gene therapy could be a watershed in the history of medicine and genome editing is unquestionably one of the most promising undertakings of science for the sake of all humankind.  But the ICB report cautions that  this development seems to require particular precautions and raises serious concerns, especially if the editing of the human genome should be applied to the germline and therefore introduce hereditary modifications, which could be transmitted to future generations  The IBC therefore called for a moratorium on this specific procedure, at its meeting, on the human genome and human rights. Recent advances have opened the door to genetic screening and testing for inherited diseases, gene therapy, the use of embryonic stem cells in medical research and the possibility of cloning and genetic  editing  for both medical and non-medical ends.  Interventions on the human genome should be admitted only for preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic reasons and without enacting modifications for descendants,  says the IBC, arguing that the alternative would  jeopardize the inherent and therefore equal dignity of all human beings and renew eugenics.  The IBC reports that rapid advances in genetics are making  designer babies  an increasing possibility, prompting calls among scientists and bioethicists for a wider public debate about the power of science to modify genetically human embryos in the laboratory, so as to control inherited traits, such as appearance and intelligence. A new genome  editing  technique called CRISPR-Cas9 makes it possible for scientists to insert, remove and correct DNA simply and efficiently. It holds out the prospect of treating or even curing certain illnesses, such as sickle cell diseases, cystic fibrosis and some cancers. But germline editing can also make changes to DNA, such as determining a baby s eye colour, easier for scientists working with human embryos, eggs and sperm. A study examining global legislation and practices concerning genetic modification, published by Hokkaido University in Japan in 2014, showed that 29 of the 39 countries reviewed had a ban on editing the human germ line. In 25 countries, the ban was legally binding. The other four had guidelines, while rules in the remaining ten were described as ambiguous. The report also cautions against the hidden danger of do-it-yourself genetic testing, saying that consumers who tested their own DNA using so-called Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) kits bought online, needed professional genetic and medical counselling to understand and act on the results. Such kits are widely available to consumers to carry out medical as well as non-medical tests, such as testing for ethnic ancestry. The committee called for clear regulations and information for consumers about such tests.","Published: October 7, 2015"

The grant was issued by the USDA s National Institute of Food and Agriculture Specialty Crop Research Initiative. Using genomics is the most cost effective as well as the most environmentally favorable solution to the problems of disease resistance since it allows growers to apply less fungicide. Cucurbit producers and processors consistently identify diseases as a primary constraint, causing severe reductions in yield, quality and profitability. Grumet said that rapid advances in genomic technology and recent genome sequencing of the four cucurbit species make them ideally poised for genomics-assisted breeding.  With the advent of next generation DNA sequencing technologies, we can approach problems in ways that were not possible before and can use those methods to identify genetic regions within the crop that are associated with disease resistance,  said Grumet.  The primary limitation for growers of cucurbit crops is losses due to disease, especially fungal and viral. And in some cases, these can completely wipe out a crop.  The project will:  Develop sustainable genomic and bioinformatics web-based platforms for genotyping by sequencing, sequence data processing and analysis, breeding data information management, and genome-wide association studies  Map resistance locations and develop markers for introgression of resistances to key cucurbit diseases  Develop models to define, parameterize, simulate and analyze costs of cucurbit production and disease control  Develop a centralized cucurbit disease website providing readily accessible information in English and Spanish for disease diagnosis and control Other institutions involved in the research include: Boyce Thompson Institute; USDA-ARS, Charleston, S.C.; Cornell University; USDA-ARS Salinas, Calif.; Texas A&M University; North Carolina State University; USDA-ARS and University of Wisconsin. The project will facilitate connections between genomicists, breeders, pathologists and economists, providing STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) training for undergraduate, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers. The Cucurbitaceae family includes many high-value, nutritious crops, consumed as vegetables and fruits in the American diet. U.S. production of watermelons, melons, cucumbers, squash and pumpkins contributes an average of $1.65 billion farm gate value per year (USDA 2009-2013).

""Researchers knew that mutations in a specific gene caused 40 per cent of inherited cases of ALS, but there are few studies of the normal function of this gene,"" said Janice Robertson, professor in the Faculty of Medicine's Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology. ""Other scientists have focused on how the gene's mutation causes disease. We've developed the first antibodies to track what this gene does in both a normal and diseased cell.""Using these antibodies, Robertson and her team tracked proteins from the key gene, C9orf72. They discovered that a specific protein from this gene might help transport other essential proteins in and out of a motor neuron cell's nucleus, the command centre of the cell.  ""We saw that a protein from C9orf72 normally surrounds the nucleus of a motor neuron cell,"" said Robertson, who is also a scientist at U of T's Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases. ""But in ALS or FTD, this protein moves to the outer membrane of the cell. When this protein is misplaced, it can't help other proteins move in and out of the cell's nucleus and the cell dies."" This transportation normally depends on a cascade of events that acts like a relay race. DNA, the cell's instructions, is converted into RNA which then makes proteins for the cell that allow it to carry out its functions. Just like a relay, when a protein from C9orf72 disappears from surrounding the nucleus, it can no longer help transport other essential proteins that keep the cell alive. Next, the researchers want to understand how C9orf72 is involved in transporting these proteins and potentially target the pathway with drugs. ""This pathway is easily targeted with drugs that already exist,"" said Dr. Shangxi Xiao, first author of the publication. ""If we can restore function to this pathway and make proteins go back to the nucleus, we could develop treatment options."" Robertson's remarkable findings provide hope for treating ALS and FTD. ALS is a neuromuscular disease that begins as a mild muscle weakness and progresses to complete paralysis. Frontotemporal dementia is closely linked to ALS and leads to memory loss, behavior changes and difficulties with movement and speech. ""James Hunter is one of our financial supporters, and he's completely paralyzed,"" said Robertson. ""He uses his eyes to communicate through a computer program, but now his eyes have almost stopped moving -- this is ALS."" Robertson believes the impact of this and others' research will revolutionize treatment for ALS and FTD. ""Recently, there have been four important publications, all honing in on this specific pathway. We're getting closer to finding treatment options,"" she said. ""We'd like to thank those involved in the James Hunter and Family ALS Initiative and the families who have donated tissues for research. Ultimately, our goal is to find a treatment for patients who desperately need more options.""","Published: October 7, 2015"

Adams Professor of Biochemistry and Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School, who have uncovered new ways for programming and directing microbial cells to carry out tasks useful to humans and the environment. The concept, according to Silver, is that by genetically programming cells like common E. coli or other bacteria species to respond to and produce certain chemicals, we can turn these microbes into so-called biological devices. In the October issue of Current Opinion in Chemical Biology, Silver writes that these ""biological devices""   made up of engineered microbes   can be used for a whole host of applications. One potential use is to detect the presence of toxins or other valuable chemicals. This could prove especially useful for identifying the presence of arsenic, other heavy metals, or organic pollutants. Not only could microbes be programmed to sense and detect chemicals in the environment, but they could also be engineered to do the same inside our own bodies. Sensing the presence of biochemical signals, they could be rigged to ""remember"" and ""report"" the presence of these signals by changing their visible color or by other easily interpreted means. This new form of diagnostic tool could give doctors new insight into the health of their patients by identifying subtle signals within the body that could indicate health conditions long before more serious symptoms present. Beyond diagnosis, experimental work has already demonstrated that bacteria could be harnessed to attack and treat cancer tumor cells, potentially adding a new weapon to the tool belts of cancer clinicians. And, these engineered microbes could potentially be used to silence countless other genes that are responsible for many devastating diseases. But in order to take these biological devices from the lab and put them to use in the real world, engineered organisms must first be proven to be reliable, predictable and cost effective.","Published: October 7, 2015"

Bernier's team has developed a highly effective in vitro technique for producing light sensitive retina cells from human embryonic stem cells. ""Our method has the capacity to differentiate 80% of the stem cells into pure cones,"" Professor Gilbert explained. ""Within 45 days, the cones that we allowed to grow towards confluence spontaneously formed organised retinal tissue that was 150 microns thick. This has never been achieved before."" In order to verify the technique, Bernier injected clusters of retinal cells into the eyes of healthy mice. The transplanted photoreceptors migrated naturally within the retina of their host. ""Cone transplant represents a therapeutic solution for retinal pathologies caused by the degeneration of photoreceptor cells,"" Bernier explained. ""To date, it has been difficult to obtain great quantities of human cones."" His discovery offers a way to overcome this problem, offering hope that treatments may be developed for currently non-curable degenerative diseases, like Stargardt disease and ARMD. ""Researchers have been trying to achieve this kind of trial for years,"" he said. ""Thanks to our simple and effective approach, any laboratory in the world will now be able to create masses of photoreceptors. Even if there's a long way to go before launching clinical trials, this means, in theory, that will be eventually be able to treat countless patients.""The findings are particularly significant in the light of improving life expectancies and the associated increase in cases of ARMD. ARMD is in fact the greatest cause of blindness amongst people over the age of 50 and affects millions of people worldwide. And as we age, it is more and more difficult to avoid - amongst people over 80, this accelerated aging of the retina affects nearly one in four. People with ARMD gradually lose their perception of colours and details to the point that they can no longer read, write, watch television or even recognize a face. ARMD is due to the degeneration of the macula, which is the central part of the retina that enables the majority of eyesight. This degeneration is caused by the destruction of the cones and cells in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a tissue that is responsible for the reparation of the visual cells in the retina and for the elimination of cells that are too worn out. However, there is only so much reparation that can be done as we are born with a fixed number of cones. They therefore cannot naturally be replaced. Moreover, as we age, the RPE's maintenance is less and less effective - waste accumulates, forming deposits. ""Differentiating RPE cells is quite easy. But in order to undertake a complete therapy, we need neuronal tissue that links all RPE cells to the cones. That is much more complex to develop,"" Bernier explains, noting nonetheless that he believes his research team is up to the challenge. Bernier has been interested in the genes that code and enable the induction of the retina during embryonic development since completing his PhD in Molecular Biology in 1997. ""During my post-doc at the Max-Planck Institute in Germany, I developed the idea that there was a natural molecule that must exist and be capable of forcing embryonic stem cells into becoming cones,"" he said. Indeed, bioinformatic analysis led him to predict the existence of a mysterious protein: COCO, a ""recombinational"" human molecule that is normally expressed within photoreceptors during their development. In 2001, he launched his laboratory at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital and immediately isolated the molecule. But it took several years of research to demystify the molecular pathways involved in the photoreceptors development mechanism. His latest research shows that in order to create cones, COCO can systematically block all the signalling pathways leading to the differentiation of the other retinal cells in the eye. It's by uncovering this molecular process that Bernier was able to produce photoreceptors. More specifically, he has produced S-cones, which are photoreceptor prototypes that are found in the most primitive organisms. Beyond the clinical applications, Professor Bernier's findings could enable the modelling of human retinal degenerative diseases through the use of induced pluripotent stem cells, offering the possibility of directly testing potential avenues for therapy on the patient's own tissues.","Published: October 7, 2015"

It can invade a cell, take over its inner machinery, trick it into making more virus DNA and escape with a new posse of virus children (often killing the host in the process).  Viruses Show Us the Truth About DNA A virus called Phage T2 played a starring role in experiments that proved DNA contains the stuff of life. We take it for granted that life is coded in DNA, but in the 1950s many scientists thought proteins contained our genetic material instead. A virus called bacteriophage T2 helped clinch the debate in DNA s favor in what are now famously known as the Hershey-Chase experiments. T2 creates copies of itself by injecting its genetic material into bacteria, where it uses the cell to reproduce. Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase created two sets of radioactive T2 viruses   one with glowing protein and one with glowing DNA   and set them loose on bacteria. The experiment showed that infected bacteria lit up only when exposed to glowing DNA, proving that DNA had been passed on to the cells, while the glowing protein was discarded. Here s an animated explainer from UC Davis. Viruses and Genetic Engineering Bacteria-eating viruses helped scientists discover a new way to genetically modify cells in just about any organism   including humans.  Bacteriophages are viruses that reproduce by injecting their DNA into bacteria, often killing the bacterium in the process. But in the 1980s, it was discovered that bacteria have a natural defense system, and scientists have recently learned to use this system to engineer DNA on command. It s called CRISPR/Cas9, and it s proving to be a cheap, fast and accurate way to manipulate DNA in the lab. A powerful  search and replace  tool, CRISPR/Cas9 allows scientists to  train  cells to hunt down specific genes to disable them, and even to repair faulty genes by swapping in single genetic  letters.  Many believe that CRISPR/Cas9 will be used to treat diseases in the near future. Scientists recently used CRISPR/Cas9 tosuccessfully modify human T cells to better fight HIV and cancer. Giant Viruses and Stargates Scientists keep finding bigger, stranger viruses, and it s kind of jarring. In 2003, scientists accidentally discovered the largest virus ever recorded. It s called the Mimivirus and, after 10 years of suffering from mistaken identity, genetic sequencing proved that it was not bacteria but the strangest virus anyone had ever seen. It s about 20 times bigger than the average virus and it contains genes previously thought to belong only to cellular life. And it has a stargate: a five-pronged opening on the side of the virus  head opens to release genetic material, infecting a host cell to create more viruses. Fortunately, it only attacks amoebas. But Mimivirus isn t alone. Since 2003, scientists have discovered three more giant viruses. The latest, Pithovirus, was discovered last year in 30,000-year-old Siberian permafrost   and it turns out it s still infectious after a good thaw.","Published: October 7, 2015"

Although only a few micrometers in size, microbes have been responsible for shaping much of the world around us, including the air that we breathe and the ground that we walk on. Indeed, there would be no life on Earth without them, says Tanja Bosak, the recently tenured Hayes Career Development Associate Professor of Geobiology at MIT.  We really owe microbes a lot, because there would be no complex life on Earth without these bugs having figured out how to split water and produce oxygen,  she says. Bosak, who is also director of the MIT Laboratory for Geomicrobiology and Microbial Sedimentology, investigates how life and the environment evolved together during the early years of Earth s history.  I m interested in how we can tell what microbes were doing over large periods of Earth s history when there was really nothing else but these small organisms,  Bosak says.Globetrotting for science This research takes her all over the world, studying the shape of rocks to understand how the behavior of microbes influenced the development of these formations over billions of years, she says.  For the first 80 percent of Earth s history, microbes helped to precipitate some of the planet s limestone, and as it precipitated, this limestone, in turn, helped to preserve some of the sticky microbial goo,  Bosak says. In addition to studying the rocks at sites such as Yellowstone National Park, Bosak and her team also collect samples of cyanobacteria and other microorganisms to take back to her laboratory. There, they grow the microbes under different conditions, in an attempt to understand the physical, chemical, and biological processes that influence their behavior. These experiments include exposing the microbes to different oxygen concentrations, or varying the intensity of light, or even changing the duration of their day, and monitoring how they respond to these changing conditions, Bosak says. The team recently developed a wave tank containing a layer of sediment, for example, which allows them to place the microbes within a realistic moving marine environment. They found that the microbes formed ridged and pitted structures in the sediment. These pitted structures are known to have been a common feature of the environment at the time the first animals were beginning to evolve. This means these early animals were living with microbes all around them, and possibly ate them, Bosak says.  We do a lot of experiments with the microbes to find out how they aggregate, and what forces guide that,  she says.  In some cases we find that it s actually the presence of oxygen that helps them to form different shapes, or at other times we look at the spacing between the structures they form to figure out that a lot of these microbes grew in very shallow, quiet environments and were limited by the flow of nutrients that they were photosynthesizing.  By studying the way microbes form structures, Bosak ultimately hopes to uncover clues to when microbes first learned how to produce oxygen.  One of the biggest questions in evolutionary biology is when oxygen first appeared,  Bosak says.  We know it appeared in the atmosphere around 2.2 billion years ago, but how long before that did cyanobacteria first figure out how to make it?  Bosak and her team have observed that microbes produce oxygen bubbles as they photosynthesize. Some of these bubbles can then be preserved in the rocks themselves as tiny circles. They have already found examples of these oxygen circles in rocks that are billions of years old, and are using the marks to pinpoint how long ago microbes began producing these bubbles   and therefore, when they started photosynthesizing.  There are some staggering examples of behaviors in microbes that seem to have continued in the same manner over billions of years,  Bosak says. From Croatia to MIT Bosak was born in Croatia but moved to the United States as a graduate student in 1999, as she found there were limited opportunities for undertaking basic scientific research in her home country. She completed her PhD at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena in 2004. Since moving to MIT in 2007, she has enjoyed the opportunity to collaborate with other researchers in her department.  These collaborations have taken my research into so many new directions,  Bosak says.  My department is very supportive of junior people and I love being at a place that values ideas and basic research so much.  In addition to studying the impact microbes had on the early history of the planet, Bosak and her team have also begun looking at microbial influence over modern environments, she says. The team recently took a field trip to the Bahamas, where it became clear to Bosak just how important microbes continue to be to the biology, geology, and chemistry of the planet. Microbes still exercise considerable control over the Earth s oxygen, carbon, and sulfur cycles, for example, and there is a lot that we do not yet understand about their role in these processes, she says.  Even in modern environments, where you have animals and trees and other organisms, much of these environments are still shaped by microbes,  Bosak says.  So we really want to investigate more of the physiology of these modern marine microbes, how they shape carbonate sediments today and how they respond to environmental stresses.  But Bosak continues to devote most of her time and attention to Earth s history.  The interactions between the planet and its life are fascinating,  Bosak says.  I would love to know what our planet would look like without life, and why it looks so different because there is life on it. ","Published: October 7, 2015"

Cells were discovered in 1676, and almost immediately afterward scientists began wondering why cells are so perfectly small. More than three centuries later, a team of Stanford biologists have zeroed in on a previously unknown mechanism within the cell growth cycle that controls cell size. The fundamental finding was made by studying yeast cells, but could provide insight to basic human biology as well as diseases such as cancer that thrive by manipulating this mechanism.Cells of all types seemingly ""know"" just how large to grow, and when they reach that determined size, they divide into new cells. With no clear answer for what triggers this cellular decision, Jan Skotheim, an associate professor of biology at Stanford, began searching for the mechanism nearly a decade ago. The search started in yeast, and specifically in the molecular pathway controlling cell division. Cell size was known to affect the first part of the cell division pathway to control when cells begin to replicate their DNA, known as the G1/S transition. There are analogous pathways in most organisms, but yeast is relatively simple to manipulate, so if Skotheim and his colleagues could find the trigger in yeast, they could likely apply that knowledge to other species. The obvious suspect was a protein called Cln3   as the first protein in the chain of molecular events leading to the G1/S transition, it was the likely trigger to any change regarding cell size and, ultimately, the cell's decision to divide into two cells. But Skotheim's team found that the concentration of Cln3 stayed relatively constant during cell growth. There was no clear, characteristic spike or dip in its concentration to initiate the process. This was perplexing. All known biologic pathways are initiated by some change or stimulus to the first molecule. In a combination of brilliance and frustration, a postdoctoral researcher in the group, Kurt Schmoller, had the idea to examine the concentrations of the other proteins involved in the pathway. This led them to Whi5, a protein smack in the middle of the pathway. While the cell produced enough of the other proteins to keep their concentration constant as the cell grew, Whi5 concentration started out high but was continuously diluted as the cell became larger. ""This finding was extremely exciting because it immediately lead to a new idea of how size control could work,"" said Schmoller, the lead author on the study. ""The inhibitor-dilution mechanism, where the cells dilute out an inhibitor of cell division, is very elegant and, in retrospect, seems almost obvious."" To test whether Whi5 was somehow affecting cell size from the middle of the pathway, Skotheim's team began selectively dialing its concentration up and down, and leaving all other proteins as normal. By lowering the concentration to a certain level, the researchers forced the cells to initiate division at a smaller-than-usual size. Similarly, boosting Whi5 concentration allowed the cell to grow larger than normal before dividing. This was a complete surprise to the researchers. Signaling pathways traditionally jump into action by stimulating the beginning of the pathway and then transmitting that information down the line in a chain reaction. ""We don't know of any other pathways that operate like this,"" Skotheim said. ""This looks like a huge breakthrough for us to solve this really old problem."" Although the work was driven to solve a fundamental question in biology, the finding could eventually have far-reaching implications. The yeast pathway is analogous to a similar pathway in humans, and provides a good sketch for understanding human biology. For instance, diseases can manipulate that pathway, a prime example being cancerous cells that grow rapidly and proliferate. In addition to thinking about these implications, Skotheim's group plans to conduct a genome-wide analysis to identify other biologic processes that might be impacted by cell size. Very little is known about how things like cell size and geometry affect signaling pathways, he said, but if some key protein concentrations change as cells grow, cell size could affect anything. ""Tons of things have been learned from studying the yeast cell cycle that apply directly to human cells,"" Skotheim said. ""Finding something like this that's so intuitively unlikely, I don't think we could have done it without the yeast work. But now we can test it, and we plan to apply these models to human cells.""","Published: October 7, 2015"

Tissues are not all created equal in their ability to regenerate.  Skin and blood cells are continually turning over, making entirely new populations of cells every few days. At the other end of the spectrum, heart and brain cells regenerate slowly, if at all, after injury. Between these two extremes are tissues such as the lung and liver, which have little cellular turnover in normal adults, but can regenerate extensively after injury. Such tissues, overall, are thought to be quiescent. This inactive state was previously thought to be the default mode of many tissues, including the lung, in the absence of a proliferative stimulus such as injury. However, it has remained unclear how quiescence is maintained in organs such as the lung that display a low level of cell turnover. We demonstrated that quiescence in the adult lung in an animal model is an actively maintained state and is regulated by hedgehog signaling,  said senior author Ed Morrisey, PhD, the Robinette Foundation Professor of Medicine and a professor of Cell and Developmental Biology. Morrisey is also director of the Penn Center for Pulmonary Biology and scientific director of the Penn Institute for Regenerative Medicine.  We were surprised,  Morrisey recalled.  This was the exact opposite of what other researchers had suggested and pretty much the opposite of what happens during development. We scratched our heads for a long time.  First author Tien Peng, MD and other members of the Morrisey lab used multiple approaches to determine what hedgehog was doing in the adult lung. First, they deleted the gene sonic hedgehog in airway epithelial cells of the adult lung. The protein made from sonic hedgehog is secreted from airway epithelial cells and acts on the adjoining cells surrounding the airways called mesenchymal cells. The team observed that after the loss of sonic hedgehog expression,mesenchymal cells began to spontaneously proliferate. This also occurred when they directly inactivated hedgehog signaling in mesenchymal cells themselves. To determine what occurred after lung injury, the researchers performed multiple different injuries to lung tissue and found that in contrast to previous reports,hedgehog signaling decreased. This decline correlated with the loss of the cells that normally express the sonic hedgehog gene, which were destroyed as a result of the injury. With this new concept of what sonic hedgehog is doing in the adult lung, the researchers then asked what would happen if they turned on the hedgehog pathway after lung injury. Consistent with their other observations, the Morrisey team found that activation of the hedgehog pathway inhibited proliferation of the mesenchymal cells surrounding the lung airways. Overall, they found that activation of hedgehog during an injury to epithelial cells weakens replication of mesenchymal cells, whereas inactivation of hedgehog signaling prevents the restoration of quiescence after an injury. Finally, they showed that hedgehog signaling in mesenchymal cells also regulates epithelial quiescence and loss of this regulation leads to abnormal epithelial regeneration after injury. Loss of hedgehog in the adult lung leads to too many epithelial cells lining the airways after injury whereas increased hedgehog signaling blocks regeneration of the airway epithelium. Such results suggest that increased hedgehog signaling causes a breakdown of the normal regenerative properties of the lung airways, leading to degenerative disease states.  These results demonstrate that epithelial-mesenchymal interactions coordinated by hedgehog maintains the normal state of a healthy lung, and turning off hedgehog during injury can lead to abnormal cell repair and regeneration in the lung,  Morrisey said.  We think that mistakes in the hedgehog feedback loop could contribute to many adult lung diseases characterized by a chronic injury and regeneration cycle.  Indeed, the hedgehog pathway has been implicated in previous genome-wide association studies of adult lung disease.  We now have a better idea of what is going on in lung disease   in adults, hedgehog suppresses proliferation and maintains cell quiescence, as opposed to its opposite role in embryo development,  Morrisey explained.  These surprising findings suggest that researchers have to be careful in predicting the function of developmental pathways in adult organs. We need to remember that they will not always function in the same manner. ","Published: October 7, 2015"

The findings shed new light on the causes of the rare but predominately fatal horse condition and could help to develop new tools for diagnosing the illness. Scientists say that horses affected by the disease -- called equine grass sickness -- could also hold clues to human conditions. Grass sickness attacks nerve cells in horses but the causes of the disease are unknown. It causes gastric upset and muscle tremor and can kill within days. If diagnosed quickly, animals can sometimes be nursed back to health. Researchers from the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies looked at nerve tissue from six horses that had died from equine grass sickness in a bid to investigate the causes of the condition. They found that the horse tissue contained proteins that are commonly seen in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease -- such as the build-up of amyloid protein. In total, 506 different proteins were found to be altered in nerve tissue from horses with grass sickness, compared with animals that had died from other causes. This knowledge could help to develop tests for detecting the condition in horses, which can be tricky to diagnose. Around two per cent of horses die from grass sickness each year in the UK. The disease occurs almost exclusively in grass-fed animals, including ponies and donkeys. A similar condition is thought to affect cats, dogs, hares, rabbits, llamas and possibly sheep.

However, studies with a variety of stem cell types have shown that there are drawbacks and consequences to most stem cells tested in laboratory studies, such as the propensity for the cells to differentiate into several cell types (pluripotent) and to form tumors. Now, a team of American and Japanese researchers has found that when rats modeled with stroke are treated with a newly discovered kind of cell called ""Muse (multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring) cells,"" neuronal regeneration resulted in ""significant improvements in neurological and motor functions"" compared to control groups that were not transplanted with Muse cells. More good news is that the Muse cells, unlike many other pluripotent cells, do not cause tumors. The study has considerable implications for future clinical studies aimed at regenerating neurological and motor function in patients who have suffered ischemic stroke. The paper describing the study appears in the journal Stem Cells. ""Muse cells are unique stem cells that are able to self-renew and also display high efficiency for differentiating into neuron-like cells,"" explained lead author Dr. Cesar V Borlongan, Distinguished Professor and Vice-Chairman for Research at the University of South Florida (USF) College of Medicine Department of Neurosurgery and Brain Repair and Director of USF's the Center of Excellence for Aging and Brain Repair. ""Unlike mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that have previously been used in stem cell transplantation in stroke-related clinical trials, in the present study Muse cells were found to possess functional characteristics of neurons as they attain the attributes of the host microenvironment. When Muse cells were transplanted into to the brains of rats modeled with stroke, they attained neuronal characteristics."" Muse cells reside in a variety of tissues, including bone marrow, skin and fat tissues. Since these cells can be derived from dermal fibroblasts (a type of connective tissue cell that provides the structural framework for animal tissues and plays a critical role in wound healing), they can be obtained with relative ease, without the need for invasive procedures required for obtaining other kinds of stem cells. Furthermore, while many stem cells used in stem cell transplantation studies have been found to cause cancer (oncogenic), Muse cells do not produce tumors (non-tumorigenic) and exhibit exceptional tissue repair potential when introduced into the blood stream. According to the researchers, fetal stem cells may appear to be better candidates for replacing lost neural circuitry, considering that they preferentially differentiate toward being neuronal cells. However, fetal stem cell accessibility is limited and, like embryonic stem cells, their immaturity may present safety issues, such as tumor development. Also, the use of fetal and embryonic stem cells has been the topic of many ethical debates. Since Muse cells can be derived from adult tissue rather than fetal or embryonic tissue, the ethical quandaries associated with stem cell therapy may be considerably allayed with their use. Not only do Muse cells also have the practical advantage of being non-tumorigenic, they are readily accessed commercially and can also be easily collected from patient skin biopsies. Once more, Muse cells do not have to be ""induced,"" or genetically manipulated, to be pluripotent as required with some other cell varieties -- they already display inherent stem cell properties after isolation and, with their acquired neuronal properties, Muse cells spontaneously home toward the stroke-damaged sites. ""Ours is the first study to show that human skin fibroblast-derived Muse cells can have neuron-like function, possess an inherent ability to assume 'stemness' properties, and to readily differentiate into neural-lineage cells after integration into the stroke brain,"" said co-lead author Dr. Mari Dezawa, Department of Stem Cell Biology and Histology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine in Sendai, Japan.

Scientists have previously hypothesized that objects are distinguished in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex, which is near the end of this flow of information, also called the ventral stream. A new study from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) neuroscientists offers evidence that this is indeed the case. Using data from both humans and nonhuman primates, the researchers found that neuron firing patterns in the IT cortex correlate strongly with success in object-recognition tasks. ""While we knew from prior work that neuronal population activity in inferior temporal cortex was likely to underlie visual object recognition, we did not have a predictive map that could accurately link that neural activity to object perception and behavior. The results from this study demonstrate that a particular map from particular aspects of IT population activity to behavior is highly accurate over all types of objects that were tested,"" says James DiCarlo, head of MIT's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, a member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and senior author of the study, which appears in the Journal of Neuroscience. The paper's lead author is Najib Majaj, a former postdoc in DiCarlo's lab who is now at New York University. Other authors are former MIT graduate student Ha Hong and former MIT undergraduate Ethan Solomon. Earlier stops along the ventral stream are believed to process basic visual elements such as brightness and orientation. More complex functions take place farther along the stream, with object recognition believed to occur in the IT cortex. To investigate this theory, the researchers first asked human subjects to perform 64 object-recognition tasks. Some of these tasks were ""trivially easy,"" Majaj says, such as distinguishing an apple from a car. Others -- such as discriminating between two very similar faces -- were so difficult that the subjects were correct only about 50 percent of the time. After measuring human performance on these tasks, the researchers then showed the same set of nearly 6,000 images to nonhuman primates as they recorded electrical activity in neurons of the inferior temporal cortex and another visual region known as V4. Each of the 168 IT neurons and 128 V4 neurons fired in response to some objects but not others, creating a firing pattern that served as a distinctive signature for each object. By comparing these signatures, the researchers could analyze whether they correlated to humans' ability to distinguish between two objects. The researchers found that the firing patterns of IT neurons, but not V4 neurons, perfectly predicted the human performances they had seen. That is, when humans had trouble distinguishing two objects, the neural signatures for those objects were so similar as to be indistinguishable, and for pairs where humans succeeded, the patterns were very different. ""On the easy stimuli, IT did as well as humans, and on the difficult stimuli, IT also failed,"" Majaj says. ""We had a nice correlation between behavior and neural responses."" The findings support the hypothesis that patterns of neural activity in the IT cortex can encode object representations detailed enough to allow the brain to distinguish different objects, the researchers say. The researchers also tested more than 10,000 other possible models for how the brain might encode object representations. These models varied based on location in the brain, the number of neurons required, and the time window for neural activity. Some of these models, including some that relied on V4, were eliminated because they performed better than humans on some tasks and worse on others. ""We wanted the performance of the neurons to perfectly match the performance of the humans in terms of the pattern, so the easy tasks would be easy for the neural population and the hard tasks would be hard for the neural population,"" Majaj says. The research team now aims to gather even more data to ask if this model or similar models can predict the behavioral difficulty of object recognition on each and every visual image -- an even higher bar than the one tested thus far. That might require additional factors to be included in the model that were not needed in this study, and thus could expose important gaps in scientists' current understanding of neural representations of objects. They also plan to expand the model so they can predict responses in IT based on input from earlier parts of the visual stream. ""We can start building a cascade of computational operations that take you from an image on the retina slowly through V1, V2, V4, until we're able to predict the population in IT,"" Majaj says.

LHON is one of many diseases tied to gene mutations that damage the tiny energy factories that power our cells, called mitochondria. ""This study marks an important contribution to research on LHON, and in efforts toward an effective therapy. But the implications are even broader, because the approaches that the investigators used could aid therapy development for a vast array of other mitochondrial diseases,"" said Maryann Redford, D.D.S, M.P.H., a program director in Collaborative Clinical Research at NIH's National Eye Institute, which helped fund the study. Mitochondria are as complex as any modern manufacturing facility, with specialized machinery for converting nutrients and oxygen into cellular energy. They even have their own DNA, and it is mutations within this mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that lead to LHON, as well as a host of other diseases. But the unique nature of mtDNA has presented challenges for developing and testing potential therapies for such diseases. Until now, ""there was no efficient way to get DNA into mitochondria,"" said John Guy, M.D., professor of ophthalmology and director of the ocular gene therapy laboratory at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Dr. Guy's laboratory is among the first to develop an approach that can target mtDNA in living mice and people. Their success in creating a mouse model of LHON and using it to test an investigational gene therapy is described in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The global impact of LHON is unknown. In England, the estimated prevalence is about 1 in 30,000. Early symptoms include blurry vision and usually appear during the teens or early twenties. Eyesight tends to worsen over time, eventually leading to a severe loss of sharpness (acuity) and color vision. These problems are caused by a loss of retinal ganglion cells -- the cells that carry visual signals from the retina through the optic nerve and into the brain. The most common mutation behind LHON impairs a mitochondrial gene called ND4. Dr. Guy began to research a possible gene therapy approach for delivering a substitute copy of the gene into mitochondria about 15 years ago. In most studies and applications of gene therapy, viruses have become the preferred vessel for delivering genes into cells. But viruses evolved to invade the body's cells and penetrate the nucleus, which contains the bulk of our DNA, comprising about 20,000 genes. Most viruses are poor at penetrating mitochondria. To fix that, Dr. Guy and his team took advantage of the fact that mitochondria import cellular proteins that they cannot make themselves. By attaching a bit of one such protein to the outer shell of a virus-called an adeno-associated virus -- he effectively gave the virus a homing signal and entry code into mitochondria. This modified virus has been the key to creating a mouse that replicates LHON and to an investigational gene therapy for LHON that is currently in clinical trials. To create a mouse model for LHON, the researchers loaded the virus with a defective copy of the ND4 gene carrying the same mutation that causes about 70 percent of LHON cases. They also included DNA coding for a red fluorescent protein, as a visible marker for the virus and its payload. Then they injected the virus into fertilized mouse egg cells, and grew the cells to maturity. After breeding the mice through several generations, the researchers had their mouse model. The presence of the virally encoded ND4 mutation in the eye was confirmed by essentially doing an eye exam to look for the red fluorescent marker. Over time, the mice showed a loss of retinal ganglion cells, atrophy (shrinkage) of the optic nerve, and a decline in visual responses, as seen in a type of electrical recording from the retina known as an electroretinogram. To develop a gene therapy for LHON, the team packaged the normal human ND4 gene into the same stealthy virus. This combination, when injected into the eye, led to improved visual function in the LHON mouse model. When injected into normal mice, the virus carrying ND4 did not cause any adverse effects on vision. Prior to development of the new mouse model, Dr. Guy's lab had shown that they could produce temporary signs of LHON in mice. They were able to prevent development of LHON in the mice, but not reverse it. ""Now we've shown that we can improve visual function after it's been lost,"" he said. The mouse research is helping inform an ongoing NEI-supported clinical trial, which is led by Dr. Guy and is testing the safety of the same gene therapy approach (without the red fluorescent protein) in people with LHON. The trial is recruiting LHON patients who fit into three categories -- those with chronic vision loss in both eyes, with recent-onset vision loss in both eyes, or with recent-onset vision loss in one eye but no signs of abnormal vision in the other eye. The mouse studies described in this release were supported by NEI grants EY017141, EY012355, and EY014801, and by Research to Prevent Blindness. The LHON gene therapy trial is supported by a cooperative agreement from NEI (EY023558).","Published: October 6, 2015"

This is one of the conclusions that emerge from the most extensive catalogue of structural variations - changes in large sections of a person s DNA sequence - to date. Created by researchers at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), the University of Washington, and collaborators, this reference catalogue shows how these large-scale genetic alterations vary in populations across the globe, and will help guide future studies of genetics, evolution and disease. The work, carried out with the 1000 Genomes Project, is published in Nature, alongside a paper on the project s final outcomes.  When we analyzed the genomes of 2500 people, we were surprised to see over 200 genes that are missing entirely in some people,  says Jan Korbel, who led the work at EMBL in Heidelberg, Germany.  Genome sequencing is beginning to be used for diagnostic purposes, and when doctors see that a piece of the genome is missing in a patient, there s a temptation to tie that to a diagnosis,  says Evan Eichler, who led the work at the University of Washington.  We can now let clinicians know that there are certain genes that really should not be used to try to explain diseases in this way.  Many studies have implicated broadly-defined regions of the genome in common diseases. Interestingly, the large-scale changes catalogued by Korbel, Eichler and colleagues frequently occur in such disease-linked regions, implying that these structural variations are probably common risk factors for disease.  Our work reveals that structural variations are often likely to have functional consequences,  says Oliver Stegle, whose team at EMBL s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) took part in the study.  So we can now advise on what researchers should be looking for when they re trying to understand the genetic causes of a certain condition.  In keeping with existing knowledge about genetic diversity, the team found that the structural variations present in people s genomes depend on where in the world they come from. In European and Asian populations, structural variations made up a greater proportion of changes to the genome than in African populations, while African genomes harboured a much greater diversity overall. The scientists also showed that structural variations often have greater effects than changes in single letters of the genome (SNPs). And thanks to technological developments, they were able to catalogue new types of structural variation that previous studies had been missing.  We were astonished to find variations which cannot be accounted for by the processes that researchers believed usually alter the genome,  says Korbel,  it will be interesting to find out how these structural variations do arise.  The work was part of the 1000 Genomes Project, which examined genetic variation in over 2500 human genomes, with all data made available online immediately as it emerged. Thanks to this public repository, managed at EMBL-EBI, other scientists have already begun to access and make use of the data.  We re extremely grateful to everyone who donated their DNA to the project and made it available to use openly for research that can enable future biomedical advances,  says Paul Flicek, who is in charge of the public repository of the data at EMBL-EBI.  Their generosity has not only enabled this project, but will continue to bear fruits in years to come, as many studies will make use of the data. ","Published: October 6, 2015"

Now, an international team of researchers reveals that the aquatic algae from which terrestrial plant life first arose were genetically pre-adapted to form the symbiotic relationships with microorganisms that most land plants need to acquire nutrients from the soil. The finding is important because it begins to flesh out the story of how the first land plants evolved from freshwater algae, formed critical symbiotic partnerships with microorganisms like fungi and bacteria, and made the world's land masses habitable. What's more, it could help with the development of biofuels. Understanding the genetic pathways involved could allow agronomists to unlock similar genes that are likely conserved in plants such as cereals and green algae, which are promising biofuel stock but require substantial amounts of chemical fertilizer.""We were expecting that these mechanisms arose with land plants,"" explains Jean-Michel Ane, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor of bacteriology and agronomy and the senior author of the report. ""The surprise was finding in algae the mechanisms we know allow plants to interact with symbiotic fungi."" The discovery shows that the algae knew how to interact with beneficial microbes while it was still in the water, observes Pierre-Marc Delaux, who conducted the research as a postdoctoral fellow at UW-Madison and is now at the John Innes Centre in the U.K. ""Without the development of this pre-adapted capability in algae, the Earth would be a very different place today,"" says Delaux. Many plant species depend on symbiotic relationships with microorganisms to thrive. The most famous are legumes and their beneficial association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Other plant species depend on relationships with fungi to chemically convert minerals in soil to forms that benefit the plant, notes Ane. The efficient acquisition of mineral nutrients, says Ane, was likely one of the primary challenges for the earliest land plants. ""The association between plants, algae and fungi probably played a really important role in the ability of plants to colonize land,"" he says. ""In fact, many of us think early plants were able to colonize lands because they evolved the ability to associate with beneficial fungi."" The genes required to encourage symbiosis between plants and microbes likely arose in a common ancestor of green algae and land plants, says Ane. Prior to the new study, little was know about the associations between algae and fungi. The genetic pathways plants use to form a symbiosis with fungi were known in land plants called liverworts and hornworts, ancient lineages sister to all other land plant lineages. Liverworts thrive in damp environments worldwide and the oldest known liverwort fossils provide the earliest evidence of plants colonizing land. ""We had found these mechanisms in liverworts, but not algae previously,"" explains Ane. And while microorganisms had been found before in association with algae, they were believed to be pathogens, not symbionts. ""Nobody had studied associations in these freshwater algae. We think some of these associations may be beneficial."" Genetic features in plants, animals and microbes tend to be preserved and repurposed through evolutionary history. Discovering these pathways allowing associations with beneficial microbes in green algae and in cereals, which now require significant amounts of chemical fertilizer, could enable the engineering in plants of more efficient nutrient acquisition - significantly reducing the need for chemical fertilizers for food and bioenergy production.","Published: October 6, 2015"

The collaboration will also enable researchers to explore biomarkers for a number of other cancer types. Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, with a five-year survival rate of about 6 percent. It is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. When caught early, pancreatic cancer survival can be significantly improved by removing tumours surgically. Given that patients rarely exhibit symptoms until the disease has progressed, screening tests are needed to find tumors when they are amenable to curative surgery. Screening tests that look for single biological markers of the disease are ineffective because they don t discriminate between pancreatic cancer and less deadly conditions such as chronic pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis and other gastrointestinal cancers, as well as having a too low sensitivity vs. healthy individuals. In contrast, Immunovia s test platform, IMMray , creates a biological snapshot of an individual s immune- response by analysing serum proteins that change as a sign of disease. The OHSU Knight Cancer Institute s scientists will help confirm the analytes used by IMMray  PanCan-d by validating the test s findings on blood samples collected from consenting patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.  Today s collaboration with the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute represents a major milestone in the clinical validation and the US commercialization of Immunovia s first test, IMMray  PanCan-d, which has been developed for early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in blood. Our goal is to establish IMMray  PanCan-d as a standard amongst pancreatologists and diabetes physicians worldwide for detecting pancreatic cancer in high-risk groups much earlier than is possible today , emphasized Mats Grahn, Chief Executive Officer of Immunovia. Professor Carl Borrebaeck, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Founder of Immunovia continued:  We are very excited to enter into this collaboration as both the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute and Immunovia share the same vision: to significantly improve the survival rates and life quality of the patients and their families, by early detection of this deadly cancer.  Immunovia sought a collaboration with the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute because of its commitment to early detection of cancer, as well as the depth of data collected on its patient samples through OHSU s Brenden-Colson Center for Pancreatic Care, which is co-directed by OHSU s Brett C. Sheppard, M.D., and Rosalie C. Sears, Ph.D., and the expertise of its molecular diagnostics laboratories, headed by Christopher Corless, M.D., Ph.D. The OHSU Knight Cancer Institute has plans to launch one of the first large-scale precision early detection research programs of its kind after raising $1 billion in funding. The collaboration between Immunovia and the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute will use the Brenden-Colson Center samples together with matched controls to run a retrospective study to verify, in a U.S. population, the findings of previous studies from Europe and China. The Brenden-Colson registry blood samples were collected at time of diagnosis, before, during and after treatment. The clinical validation study will cover about 600 samples with different stages of pancreatic cancer, matched controls as well as patients with chronic pancreatitis. After the test has been confirmed, the OHSU Knight Diagnostic Laboratories will validate it for clinical application; the laboratories are Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified and accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP).  If we re going to make a significant impact on patients  lives and improve their chances of survival, we need to detect cancer earlier when it s most treatable. The immune system provides an early warning system that is invaluable in that effort,  said Brian Druker, M.D., director of the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute.  We expect that our collaboration with Immunovia will not only improve the kind of screening tests available, but it will also allow us to intervene earlier in the course of the disease.  If validated, Immunovia s pancreatic cancer specific test, IMMray  PanCan-d, could be the first blood-based test available for early and specific diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. It could provide physicians with actionable information early enough for the cancer to be removed surgically. IMMray  combines many years of clinical immunoproteomics research from Lund University, the development of unique serum protein biomarker signatures, and a state-of-the-art bioinformatics algorithm and software to interpret clinical test data from a variety of major diseases. Each blood sample is analysed and characterized using a disease-specific antibody microarray targeting a multiplex panel of biomarkers. A simple blood test thus provides all the necessary information for enabling early diagnosis, as well as for following disease progression, and/or therapy monitoring. The OHSU Knight Cancer Institute and Immunovia plan to work on tests for other cancers using the same technology. The OHSU Knight Cancer Institute will also use the test platform to advance its work in developing precision cancer treatments and, eventually, the technology will be employed as part of its large-scale precision early detection research program. The early detection program is made possible by the successful completion of the $1 billion Knight Cancer Challenge campaign which was launched after a $500 million pledge from Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife Penny.","Published: October 6, 2015"

SRSF1 is a splicing factor, a type of protein that plays a crucial role in the process by which genes give rise to proteins. Splicing factors such as SRSF1 help edit the coded  message  copied from genes. These copies of the gene s message, called transcripts, are made of RNA. Splicing literally snips out parts of the message   called introns   that don t encode protein; and they paste together the remaining portions of the message   called exons   that do encode protein.  SRSF1 and other splicing factors can also direct a related process called alternative splicing -- the mixing and matching of different exons from one gene, which, when spliced together, give rise to variant versions of a single protein, ones that often have very different functional properties.  Long ago we and others saw that the levels of splicing proteins are altered in various cancers,  says Krainer.  Previous work indicated that there are lots of alterations in splicing in the context of cancer,  he says. SRSF1 was previously shown to be an oncoprotein, i.e., a protein involved in cancer. When it is overexpressed, it can help convert normal cells into tumor cells. Krainer decided to examine its role in breast cancer  because we see frequent overexpression of SRSF1 in breast tumors,  he says. Experiments conducted by Olga Anczuk w and Martin Akerman, co-first authors of the new paper, other colleagues in the Krainer lab, and their collaborators at the ETH in Zurich, demonstrated how overexpression of SRSF1 in a cellular model of breast cancer resulted in changes in the RNA messages generated in the cells. This allowed the team to pinpoint the splicing targets regulated by SRSF1, and gave them a glimpse of the SRSF1-related changes in those cells. The team identified and validated hundreds of alternative splicing events regulated by SRSF1. They also looked at data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, identifying alternative splicing events associated with SRSF1 overexpression in human breast tumors.  We pay special attention to potential targets that overlap between all these different data sets, because it's a way of narrowing down or giving higher priority to targets that may play an important role,  explains Anczuk w.  Based on the overlap between SRSF1 overexpression data in breast cancer cell lines and human breast tumors, the researchers identified a candidate gene called CASC4. Overexpressing one alternatively-spliced form of the CASC4 protein partially mimicked the effects of overexpressing SRSF1, suggesting that CASC4 contributes to SRSF1 s oncogenic effects. Krainer says CASC4 is likely to be just one of many targets that explain SRSF1 s ability to cause cancer, and several targets probably act in concert to produce all the oncogenic changes related to SRSF1 overexpression.  Identifying the key oncogenic alternative splicing events caused by SRSF1 and other splicing factors could lead to potential therapeutic targets for treating breast cancer.  If we find that a particular change is really critical in tumor maintenance, then we could potentially develop therapies to restore the normal splicing pattern,  says Krainer.  It probably depends on there being a small number, ideally one, but maybe a couple of crucial targets that the tumors really depend upon. ","Published: October 6, 2015"

We found, however, that hepatic fibrosis and steatosis (infiltration of liver cells with fat) are strong genetic traits. At around 50 percent heritability, they re more genetic than body mass index.  Loomba and colleagues performed a cross-sectional analysis of 60 pairs of twins residing in Southern California. Forty-two pairs were monozygotic or identical, meaning they developed from a single fertilized egg that split to form two embryos. Eighteen were dizygotic or fraternal, developing from two different eggs, each fertilized by separate sperm cells.Using two advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques that quantify fat content in the liver and liver stiffness (a measure of fibrosis), the researchers found that 26 of the 120 participants had nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which can be a precursor to development of more serious conditions. Hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis correlated strongly with monozygotic twins, but not with dizygotic pairs.  This evidence that hepatic steatosis and hepatic fibrosis are heritable traits has major implications,  said Loomba.  It means that we can now look for the relevant genes as potential therapeutic targets.  Loomba said the research team plans to expand their research to include the role of the microbiome   the collective genomes of the microorganisms that reside within and on humans, and which also indicates a degree of heritability. Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis are among the hottest areas in research and medicine at the moment, according to Loomba, with more than a dozen clinical trials currently underway. NAFLD, which is characterized by hepatic steatosis, is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States, affecting 80 to 100 million Americans, with 18 million believed to have the more serious NASH.","Published: October 6, 2015"

Dr Goberdhan said:  We found that aggressive cancer cells manufacture more PAT4, which enables them to make better use of available nutrients than the cells around them   including healthy tissue.  Cancer cells often have restricted access to the body s nutrient-rich blood supply. The ability to sense and acquire nutrients is critical for a cancer to grow.Dr Goberdhan s and Prof Harris s groups collaborated to develop an antibody that could be used to highlight PAT4 in human tissue samples. This was then used to study anonymous tumour samples taken from patients with colorectal cancer, a common form of the disease. The results were compared to the known outcomes for the patients. Those who had higher levels of PAT4 in their tumours did less well than those with lower levels   being more likely to relapse and die. The researchers then looked at what happened when PAT4 levels were reduced. They showed that by reducing PAT4 levels, cancerous tumours grew more slowly. Dr Goberdhan said:  These findings support each other. Not only do higher levels of PAT4 mean a worse outcome, but lowering levels improves the situation. This means that we have identified a mechanism which cancer cells prefer to use and which we might be able to target as part of a combination treatment. ","Published: October 6, 2015"

The process is routine but mysterious, as the micro-mechanics involved are not yet well understood.   We know most of the proteins involved and have a pretty good handle on the biology and genetics,  says co-first author Scott Forth, a postdoc in the Laboratory of Chemistry and Cell Biology, led by Tarun Kapoor, who is the Pels Family Professor.  But we don t yet know much about the mechanical side of things, and cell division is a very mechanical process.  The researchers described how a protein called kinesin-5 acts like a kind of molecular motor to help organize the mitotic spindle. Ultimately, their work could have medical implications, since a better understanding of cell division could lead to new cancer therapies to hinder tumor cells  reproduction.The mitotic spindle includes thousands of microtubules, rod-like structures with polarized tips, which biologists term  plus ends  and  minus ends.   Because microtubules exist in great numbers alongside each other akin to train tracks, they naturally move, shift, and overlap. Around the spindle s center, they mostly exist in an anti-parallel configuration, in which their plus and minus ends point in opposite directions; towards its poles, the parallel configuration prevails, in which their plus and minus ends point in the same direction. In order to segregate chromosomes into the two emerging cells, the spindle itself needs a bipolar structure, and so the microtubules must be sorted to align with the long pole-to-pole axis of the spindle. This job is accomplished by kinesin-5, which can bind to two overlapping microtubules, linking them like a bar in the letter H, and directing them to the appropriate locations. For this study, the researchers took a detailed look at the physical forces generated by the motor protein as it helps organize the mitotic spindle. To do the sorting, kinesin-5 can link two anti-parallel microtubules, pushing them in opposite directions, so their minus ends move away from the spindle s center and toward the spindle s poles. The force exerted by kinesin-5 in that process hasn t been previously measured. By shining a laser light on a microscopic-sized plastic bead attached to a pair of microtubules linked by kinesin-5 molecules, the team tracked their activity and discovered that this force is a function of the microtubule overlap the longer the overlap, the greater the force.  This is a way by which the cell can tune the amount of force it needs in order to build a nice balanced spindle structure,  Forth says. Kinesin-5 can also link parallel microtubules, and the researchers found that in this case, it behaves differently. Rather than producing a pushing force, it generates a resisting force that can slow down the microtubules  motion. And here again, that force scales up with the length of overlap between the microtubules.  We believe that kinesin-5 has the ability to coordinate the speed of microtubules and keep them from going too fast or too slow,  says Forth, likening the protein to a gear box in the car.  It helps coordinate and govern the speed and location of the microtubules in the spindle.  As many kinesin-5 molecules work together directing microtubules, they become the governing force of the spindle formation.  This work represents an important advance in our efforts to build, from the ground up, the dynamic spindle apparatus out of purified proteins,  says Kapoor, the senior author.  It also helps reveal how nanometer-sized proteins work together to assemble complex cellular structures that are thousands of times larger than themselves. ","Published: October 6, 2015"

Stephen Collins, MD, PhD, formerly Chief Executive Officer of Insero Health, has become President and CEO of Biscayne Pharmaceuticals. Samuel Reich, who co-founded both Biscayne and Insero Health, will retain the position of Executive Chairman of the combined companies. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.  Insero s lead compound, BIS-001, is a highly potent and selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChE) that is a synthetic form of a single agent traditional Chinese medicine. It has demonstrated striking efficacy in highly predictive models of difficult-to-treat epilepsies, such as Dravet syndrome and refractory Complex Partial (Focal) Seizures. In Insero s Phase 1 study in adults with drug-resistant complex partial epilepsy, BIS-001 was safe and well-tolerated, and blood levels necessary for development of an extended release form of the drug were established.  Epilepsy affects about three million people in the U.S. and over 50 million people worldwide. Many patients with epilepsy take multiple medications, yet the published literature suggests that as many as one-third are unable to control their seizures with current therapies. Biscayne is continuing development of new cancer therapies based on a novel molecular target--growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) receptors. GHRH normally acts on receptors in the pituitary to produce the growth hormone needed for tissue growth and repair. Biscayne s Scientific Co-Founder, Dr. Andrew V. Schally, discovered that cancer cells also have GHRH receptors and produce GHRH on their own. Biscayne is developing GHRH antagonists that inhibit tumor growth by blocking the activity of tumoral GHRH. In xenograft studies, these antagonists have shown excellent safety and promising antitumor activity in a range of cancers, and the company believes they may have therapeutic potential in multiple types of difficult-to-treat tumors.  Biscayne now is in the enviable position of having two novel platforms with excellent proprietary protection championed by world class scientists and targeting refractory conditions with major unmet needs,  said Mr. Reich.  Insero was co-founded by Harvard neurology professor Dr. Steven Schachter, a leading epilepsy expert who has conducted more than 70 epilepsy clinical trials over the course of a highly distinguished career, and Biscayne s cancer program is based on the work of Nobel laureate Dr. Andrew Schally, a renowned endocrine researcher and prolific drug developer. Our new CEO, Dr. Stephen Collins, brings Biscayne extensive successful drug development and management experience at both global pharmaceutical and entrepreneurial biotechnology companies.   Mr. Reich continued,  With a Phase 1b/2a proof-of-concept epilepsy trial planned for 2016, our lead cancer compound entering initial IND-enabling studies and an expanded, highly experienced management team in place, we believe we are well-positioned to launch the series B financing that will enable us to advance these high potential programs.   Dr. Collins noted,  The impetus for my joining Insero was my enthusiasm for the potential of our innovative approach to provide a safe and effective treatment option for the large population of epilepsy patients who remain poorly controlled on current therapies. I am delighted to bring this novel program, which may additionally have applications in pain and other CNS conditions, to Biscayne, where we also are developing first-in-class cancer agents based on a promising new molecular target in a biomarker driven program that is focusing on refractory cancers with high unmet need.   Dr. Collins has extensive experience in the development of new drugs. Before joining Insero, he was CEO of NeuroTherapeutics Pharma, and Chief Scientific Officer & Vice President, Clinical Affairs at Ovation Pharmaceuticals, where he oversaw R&D, won FDA approval for the orphan drugs vigabatrin and clobazam, and advanced multiple programs in oncology and neuroscience into late stage development. Prior to Ovation, Dr. Collins was Global Senior Director of CNS and Pain at Johnson & Johnson, overseeing early-stage development of CNS agents. At Abbott Laboratories, Dr. Collins contributed to the FDA approval of such drugs as Depakote ER  and Depacon . He earned an AB degree in Biophysics at the University of California, Berkeley and MD and PhD degrees at Case Western Reserve University.","Published: October 6, 2015"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/predictive-model-for-breast-cancer-progression-205840,Predictive Model for Breast Cancer Progression Biomedical engineers have demonstrated a proof of principle technique that could give women and their oncologists more personalized information to help them choose options for treating breast cancer  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Thanks to diagnostic tests, clinicians and patients can already know the type of breast cancer they re up against, but one big question remains: How likely is it that the cancer will invade other parts of the body? Answering that question could help guide the choice of treatment options, from aggressive and difficult therapies to more conservative ones. By studying chemical signals from specific cells that are involved in helping cancer invade other tissues in each woman s body, researchers have developed a predictive model that could provide an invasiveness index for each patient.  We want women to have more information to make a personal decision beyond the averages calculated for an entire population,  said Manu Platt, an associate professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University.  We are using our systems biology tools and predictive medicine approaches to look at potential markers we could use to help us understand the risk each woman has. This would provide information for a more educated discussion of treatment options. The research was sponsored with funds from the Georgia Research Alliance and the Giglio family donation to the Department of Biomedical Engineering. Beyond breast cancer, the technique could offer similar decision-making assistance for men with prostate cancer, where treatment also requires making difficult choices about the risk of metastasis. Platt s research team is examining chemical signals produced by the macrophages that can help aggressive tumors invade new tissues. Macrophages normally clean up foreign particles and harmful microorganisms in the body, but aggressive tumors can enlist macrophages in helping them metastasize. Tumor associated macrophages contribute significantly to tumor invasion, with cysteine cathepsin proteases   enzymes that break down proteins in the body   important contributors. To develop their predictive index, Platt s research team used variability in macrophage expression of four types of cathepsin, the cathepsin inhibitor cystatin C, and kinase activation levels. The model, which has been under development for two years, was produced by studying macrophages from a population of women who didn t have breast cancer. Platt and colleagues Keon-Young Park and Gande Li co-cultured a standard breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) with macrophages produced from monocytes donated by these cancer-free women. Next, they measured the level of invasiveness facilitated by macrophages from each individual donor, exposing the cancer cells and macrophages to a collagen gel designed to simulate breast tissue and measuring how many cells invaded it. While the breast is composed of many other tissues, collagen makes up the largest proportion and provided a good measure of how aggressively the cells would invade, Platt said. Platt s team correlated the level of invasion through the gel to the chemical signals being expressed by the macrophages. The researchers were surprised at the large amount of patient-to-patient variability in macrophage activity   variability that could account for the outcome differences in the patients receiving similar cancer treatments. The signaling levels and related invasion measurements were used to train a computational model developed by Platt s team. The researchers next obtained blood samples containing monocytes from nine patients being treated for breast cancer at DeKalb Medical Center, a major Atlanta-area hospital. They measured signals from these macrophages and used their model   which had been trained on macrophage signaling and resulting invasiveness   to predict which of the cancer patients would be expected to have more invasive types of cancer. They compared their predications to what the clinician   Dr. John Kennedy   provided as their initial diagnosis.  Based on the cells we got from the clinic, the ones that had been predicted to have the greatest potential for invasion were the ones that had produced the most invasive form of breast cancer in the patients,  Platt said. While the study could not account for possible differences in the length of time the cancers had been growing, they did correlate well with observations. In future research, Platt hopes to follow the women for five years to determine if the model s predictions are related to cancer recurrence. He also plans to expand the model with additional macrophage data, and test it against additional blood samples.  The more information you give the model, the closer you get to the prediction,  he said.  We think this is a very big start.  The strength of this technique, Platt believes, is that it measures what s happening at the level where cancer is metastasizing.  We are measuring at the level of activity of these intracellular enzymes and the ultimate activity of the proteases they produce that are not only the biomarkers of the tumor, but also help the tumor grow,  he said.  Everything about us is different. Our genetics are different and our lifestyles are different, so clinicians have to make decisions in all that variability. All of those differences can be measured and captured in this output.  Platt believes the technique could one day lead to a simple blood test that would provide information useful in making therapy recommendations. The test might also help determine which women should be monitored more closely to detect the beginnings of a cancer.  Together, this establishes proof-of-principle that personalized information acquired from minimally invasive blood draws may provide useful information to inform oncologists and patients of invasive/metastatic risk, helping to make decisions regard radical mastectomy or milder, conservative treatments to save patients from hardship and surgical recovery,  he wrote in the paper.","Published: October 6, 2015"

A therapeutic antibody, brodalumab was designed to block the function of the immune signaling protein interleukin 17 (IL-17). If not blocked, IL-17 docks into specifically shaped proteins, IL-17 receptors, to pass on signals that contribute to abnormal, psoriatic inflammation. ""Brodalumab is the only IL-17 receptor antagonist in clinical development,"" said Mark Lebwohl, MD, Sol and Clara Kest Professor and Chairman of the Kimberly and Eric J. Waldman Department of Dermatology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. ""Studies demonstrate that brodalumab binds to the IL-17 receptor, thus preventing IL-17 and its partner molecules or ligands from doing so, to counter inflammatory diseases. When it comes to complete clearing, our results are better than any previously published and confirm that targeting the IL-17 receptor is highly effective in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Treatment was so effective that many patients did not have a dot of psoriasis left on their bodies."" Plaque psoriasis is a non-contagious chronic disease in which the immune system causes skin cells to grow at an accelerated rate. Instead of being shed, skin cells pile up, causing painful, scaly patches that can crack and bleed on the scalp, knees, elbows, and lower back. The lifelong disease affects two to three percent of the global population and can have a significant negative impact on health-related quality of life. The main measure of success in the newly published Phase III clinical studies was the degree of reduction in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index or (PASI), which scores psoriatic plaque redness, scaling and thickness of psoriatic skin lesions and the extent of the body involved. Treatment efficacy is often measured by the reduction of PASI from the baseline (i.e., a 100 percent reduction is known as PASI 100). After 12 weeks, 44 percent of patients randomized to receive the greater 210-mg every-other-week dosage of brodalumab in one study had achieved PASI 100, compared with 22 percent of patients treated with ustekinumab (Stelara), a treatment that blocks related inflammatory signaling chemicals or cytokines (IL-12 and IL-23). In the second study, 37 percent of patients randomized to receive the greater 210-mg every-other-week dosage of brodalumab achieved PASI 100, compared with 19 percent of patients treated with Stelara. Also, with the greater dosage of brodalumab, 86 percent of patients achieved PASI 75, a 75 percent reduction in symptoms. Stelara is already approved the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is widely used for the treatment of psoriasis. The results of the current studies will be relevant when the FDA considers the application for brodalumab. During the past two decades, new data on the physiopathology of psoriasis has opened the doors to novel therapeutic treatments such as Il-17 inhibitors, a new class of drugs in clinical studies for the treatment of the disease. Earlier systemic therapies and medications used to treat the disease were not as targeted at blocking the IL-17 receptor and therefore affected larger portions of the immune system. Overall, the frequencies of the most common adverse events in the new studies were similar between brodalumab treatment and placebo. These events were generally mild to moderate and included upper respiratory tract infection, headache, joint pain, low white blood cell count, inflammation of the mucous membranes, and yeast infection. In addition, two patients of the 3,712 (0.05%) enrolled in the published clinical studies committed suicide (one brodalumab patient in the 52-week controlled period and one in the open-label extension of the present studies during which all patients received brodalumab). Independent of therapy, psoriasis patients are at increased risks for depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. No causality between brodalumab and these events has been established.","Published: October 6, 2015"

Researchers said their findings provided important new evidence for an inherited susceptibility to glioma, and offered potential clues for how to treat or prevent the disease. Scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, led an international team in analysing DNA from more than 5,637 people who had developed glioma, comparing it with 9,158 people without the disease. Their study was mainly funded by Cancer Research UK, the Wellcome Trust and the DJ Fielding Medical Research Trust. The research added analysis of new cases to a  meta-analysis  of four previous studies, and pulled together data from people with glioma from Europe, the US and Canada. Each variant is a one-letter difference in the DNA code which increases the risk of glioma in those who have it. This study brings the total number of genetic variants linked to glioma to 12. One variant was associated with a 23% increased risk of glioblastoma   although because glioma is a rare disease, the underlying risk to any individual remains small. This variant was close in the DNA code to the gene encoding RNA polymerase III, which plays a complex role in the synthesis and manufacture of intra-cellular messenger molecules that build other proteins. The other four genetic variants were found to increase the risk of less aggressive, non-glioblastoma forms of glioma by around 5% each. These may also act through their effect on other nearby genes. One variant has an intriguing link with a gene called VTI1A, which is involved in nerve development and the cellular response to insulin. Study leader Professor Richard Houlston, Professor of Molecular and Population Genetics at the ICR, said:  We believe our study is the largest ever conducted of the genetics of glioma   the most common form of brain cancer   and it provides firm evidence that susceptibility to the disease is in part inherited.  One of the risk factors we identified is linked to quite a dramatically increased chance of developing glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive kind of brain cancer. Our study sheds fresh light on the biology of gliomas, and could provide clues to why the disease develops, and how it could be treated or prevented.  Dr Aine McCarthy, science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said:  These are exciting results because identifying genetic mistakes that increase the risk of glioma could be a vital first step towards developing new treatments against the disease. Building on these findings and determining the exact role these genetic changes play in the development of glioma could help doctors personalise treatment for the disease in the future and save more lives.

The round was led by new investor Wales Life Sciences Fund. Current investors Vesalius Biocapital, LRM, PMV and Wyvern also participated in the round. Existing shareholders include the Wellcome Trust. Brenig Preest, Wales Life Sciences Fund, will join the Apitope board. The funds will enable Apitope to progress the clinical development of its innovative pipeline which includes therapies for Factor VIII intolerance in Haemophilia A patients and Graves  disease. Apitope will relocate its UK headquarters to Wales. Apitope, whose first product candidate is licensed to Merck Serono, will now progress its remaining portfolio of product candidates developed with its proprietary platform technology. Apitope s lead product candidate, ATX-F8-117, has recently received orphan designations in both Europe and USA and targets Haemophillia A. This potential front line therapy for patients with Factor VIII inhibitors is thought to be of huge strategic value with the prospective to replace current therapies in a $4 billion plus market. Dr Keith Martin, CEO of Apitope, commented:  We are very pleased to have attracted investment from the Wales Life Sciences Fund and appreciate the commitment of our existing investors and their ongoing support. The funding will enable us to progress development of our product ATX-F8-117, which received Orphan Drug Designation from both the US FDA and the EMA highlighting the need for an effective treatment for Haemophilia A patients developing Factor VIII inhibitors. The funds will also enable us to progress our candidate for the treatment of Graves  disease which impacts over 7.5 Million people worldwide.  Brenig Preest, Investment Director, Wales Life Sciences Fund and newly appointed to the Apitope board, added:  We were impressed with Apitope s growth to date and strongly believe in the company s approach in treating autoimmune diseases. I look forward to working with the highly experienced senior management team to develop treatments against autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical needs. Relocating Apitope s UK headquarters will contribute to the growing and the vibrant life sciences sector in Wales.  St phane Verdood, Chairman of the Apitope Board, added:  We welcome the investment from the Wales Life Sciences Fund and Brenig Preest to the board. This series B funding is strong endorsement of Apitope s technology for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and its promising treatments for Factor VIII inhibitors as well as Graves  disease.  Haemophilia A is a rare chronic bleeding disorder which leads to inadequate clotting of the blood in response to any type of injury or surgery. It is a genetic disorder that causes missing or defective Factor VIII, an essential blood-clotting protein. Haemophilia A patients are normally treated with Factor VIII to help with the clotting of their blood. However, since these patients  immune systems have had no or low exposure to Factor VIII, they are often not fully tolerant to the replacement Factor VIII used to treat their condition. Consequently, up to 30 per cent of these patients develop Factor VIII inhibitor antibodies. Graves  disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects over 7.5 Million people worldwide. Patients with Graves  disease typically develop goitre and serious medical issues such as increased heart rate, muscle weakness, disturbed sleep, and irritability. It affects multiple systems of the body, including the skin, heart, circulation and nervous system with potential long term morbidity. Some 30-50% of Graves  disease patients develop the medically challenging Graves  orbitopathy characterized by bulging eyes (proptosis), while 3-5% of such patients suffer from a sight-threatening form of Graves  orbitopathy.","Published: October 6, 2015"

Traditional methods of halting severe bleeding are not very effective when the blood loss originates inside the body like the uterus, sinus or abdomen.  People have developed hundreds of agents that can clot blood but the issue is that it s hard to push these therapies against severe blood flow, especially far enough upstream to reach the leaking vessels. Here, for the first time, we ve come up with an agent that can do that,  Kastrup said. Kastrup teamed up with a group of researchers, biochemical engineers and emergency physicians to develop simple, gas-generating calcium carbonate micro-particles that can be applied in powder form to stop critical bleeding. The particles work by releasing carbon dioxide gas, like antacid tablets, to propel them toward the source of bleeding. The carbonate forms porous micro particles that can bind with a clotting agent known as tranexamic acid, and transport it through wounds and deep into the damaged tissue. After studying and modeling the movement of the particles in vitro, the researchers confirmed their results using two animal models. Even in a scenario that mimicked a catastrophic event like a gunshot wound to a femoral artery, the particles proved highly effective in stopping the bleeding. While much more rigorous testing and development is needed to bring the agent to market, the particles could have a wide range of uses, from sinus operations to treating combat wounds.  The area we re really focusing on is postpartum hemorrhage: in the uterus, after childbirth where you can t see the damaged vessels but you can put the powder into that area and the particles can propel and find those damaged vessels,  said Kastrup.","Published: October 6, 2015"

Previous studies, ran with patients at Barts Health NHS Trust in London, showed Cladribine to be highly effective in treating relapsing MS. One trial showed the drug reduced relapses by over 50 per cent, and nearly 50 percent of people showed no signs of disease activity at all over two years. However, Cladribine was refused market authorisation on the suspicion it may cause cancer based on the interpretation of previous data. A newly published study compared the incidence of cancer where patients had been treated with Cladribine to other studies where they had been treated with other similar drugs that are currently licensed for MS. The team from the Blizard Institute at QMUL compared data from the 11 pivotal trials that were used to support the licensing of seven different drugs to examine the cancer risk. They found there was no evidence for an increased risk of cancer in people with MS taking Cladribine.Cladribine appears to be more effective, safer, easier to use and could potentially be cheaper than other current drugs used to treat MS.  Our research shows that clinical academics and drug makers should continue to develop Cladribine for people with relapsing MS as the risk of developing cancer is no greater than for other types of current medication,  said Dr Klaus Schmierer, lead author and Reader in Clinical Neurology at QMUL and Consultant Neurologist at Barts Health NHS Trust. He added:  As well as being easier and cheaper to administer, Cladribine benefits female patients who want to get pregnant. Other drugs used to treat relapsing MS need to be stopped during pregnancy and that can expose women to increased risk of MS disease activity. That s not the case with Cladribine, which has a long lasting effect.  It is estimated that over 120,000 people with MS live in the UK and it affects over two million patients globally.

The Common Fund planning process identifies major challenges that impede progress in research as well as emerging areas of science that promise to change the way we think about health and disease or the way we approach prevention or treatment. Common Fund programs that emerge are goal-driven, with deliverables expected within a five to 10 year period. The 2015 awards represented first-year funding of a multiyear program.  These awards aim to provide catalytic support to areas of research that no one institute or center at NIH would be able to address on its own  said James M. Anderson, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives, which oversees the NIH Common Fund.  With this support, we hope to capitalize on recent scientific advances to create resources and opportunities that will transform and accelerate these areas of research.  The Glycoscience Program is addressing the difficulty of studying proteins and lipids that have complex sugars attached, a problem that stymies researchers in virtually every arena of biomedical research. These carbohydrate modifications play important roles in numerous disease processes, but they are exceedingly difficult to study. This program is awarding approximately $10 million to 23 research teams to make the study of carbohydrate chemistry and biology more accessible to the broad research community by developing tools and methods that are simple, reliable, and easy-to-use for non-specialists. The goal of the Glycoscience Program is to simplify carbohydrate research by developing simple methods and technologies for synthesizing carbohydrates, creating accessible tools for studying carbohydrates and their interaction partners, and fostering the integration and analysis of the information gained with the genomic and proteomic knowledge base. The program is led by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), and the awards are administered by several institutes and centers. The 4D Nucleome Program is leveraging recent technological advances to transform the way we  understand gene regulation. In recent years, it has become clear that the DNA and DNA associated proteins found in each cell nucleus are precisely organized in three dimensions and this organization changes over time   the fourth dimension. However, the functional consequences of this organization on gene expression, cellular function, development, and disease are unknown. The 4D Nucleome Program is supporting its first set of 29 awards, in which researchers will work together as a consortium to investigate nuclear organization in space and time, with a focus on investment in future technology development. Totaling approximately $25 million, this program includes support for an interdisciplinary consortium to explore nuclear organization and function; development of new chemical, biochemical, and imaging tools; studies of structural and functional subregions within the nucleus; an organizational hub to facilitate collaboration and resource sharing; and a data center to coordinate and integrate data generated by the 4D Nucleome investigators. These awards are being administered by the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program will develop a data resource for the pediatric research community of clinical and genetic sequence data that will allow scientists to identify genetic pathways that underlie structural birth defects and childhood cancer. Increased understanding of the underlying genetics of these conditions would be a first step towards potentially developing prevention, early detection, and therapeutic interventions. DNA sequencing centers at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, and Washington University, St. Louis, each received $6.3 million to generate genetic sequence data from structural birth defects and childhood cancer research cohorts. In future years, the program plans to support additional analyses and data coordination efforts which will enable molecular networks that may link apparently disparate conditions to be identified. The sequencing center grants are managed by the National Human Genome Research Institute. The Science of Behavior Change Program aims to implement a mechanism-focused, experimental medicine approach to behavior change research. Unhealthy behaviors, including lack of adherence to medical regimens, account for approximately 40 percent of premature deaths in the United States. The Science of Behavior Change Research Network will bring together teams of basic and clinical scientists to implement an experimental approach to behavior change, which will involve: identifying behavior change targets common across multiple diseases, developing assays to measure target engagement, testing interventions for efficacy, and disseminating validated assays and tools to researchers and clinicians. The network will receive approximately $7 million to fund a total of nine awards that are being administered by the National Institute on Aging, NIDA, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Development, NHLBI, NIDDK, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, the National Institute of Nursing Research, and NIDCR.","Published: October 6, 2015"

LHON is one of many diseases tied to gene mutations that damage the tiny energy factories that power our cells, called mitochondria.  This study marks an important contribution to research on LHON, and in efforts toward an effective therapy. But the implications are even broader, because the approaches that the investigators used could aid therapy development for a vast array of other mitochondrial diseases,  said Maryann Redford, D.D.S, M.P.H., a program director in Collaborative Clinical Research at NIH s National Eye Institute, which helped fund the study.Mitochondria are as complex as any modern manufacturing facility, with specialized machinery for converting nutrients and oxygen into cellular energy. They even have their own DNA, and it is mutations within this mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that lead to LHON, as well as a host of other diseases. But the unique nature of mtDNA has presented challenges for developing and testing potential therapies for such diseases. Until now,  there was no efficient way to get DNA into mitochondria,  said John Guy, M.D., professor of ophthalmology and director of the ocular gene therapy laboratory at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Dr. Guy s laboratory is among the first to develop an approach that can target mtDNA in living mice and people. Their success in creating a mouse model of LHON and using it to test an investigational gene therapy is described today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The global impact of LHON is unknown. In England, the estimated prevalence is about 1 in 30,000. Early symptoms include blurry vison and usually appear during the teens or early twenties. Eyesight tends to worsen over time, eventually leading to a severe loss of sharpness (acuity) and color vision. These problems are caused by a loss of retinal ganglion cells   the cells that carry visual signals from the retina through the optic nerve and into the brain. The most common mutation behind LHON impairs a mitochondrial gene called ND4. Dr. Guy began to research a possible gene therapy approach for delivering a substitute copy of the gene into mitochondria about 15 years ago. In most studies and applications of gene therapy, viruses have become the preferred vessel for delivering genes into cells. But viruses evolved to invade the body s cells and penetrate the nucleus, which contains the bulk of our DNA, comprising about 20,000 genes. Most viruses are poor at penetrating mitochondria. To fix that, Dr. Guy and his team took advantage of the fact that mitochondria import cellular proteins that they cannot make themselves. By attaching a bit of one such protein to the outer shell of a virus   called an adeno-associated virus   he effectively gave the virus a homing signal and entry code into mitochondria. This modified virus has been the key to creating a mouse that replicates LHON and to an investigational gene therapy for LHON that is currently in clinical trials. To create a mouse model for LHON, the researchers loaded the virus with a defective copy of the ND4 gene carrying the same mutation that causes about 70 percent of LHON cases. They also included DNA coding for a red fluorescent protein, as a visible marker for the virus and its payload. Then they injected the virus into fertilized mouse egg cells, and grew the cells to maturity. After breeding the mice through several generations, the researchers had their mouse model. The presence of the virally encoded ND4 mutation in the eye was confirmed by essentially doing an eye exam to look for the red fluorescent marker. Over time, the mice showed a loss of retinal ganglion cells, atrophy (shrinkage) of the optic nerve, and a decline in visual responses, as seen in a type of electrical recording from the retina known as an electroretinogram. To develop a gene therapy for LHON, the team packaged the normal human ND4 gene into the same stealthy virus. This combination, when injected into the eye, led to improved visual function in the LHON mouse model. When injected into normal mice, the virus carrying ND4 did not cause any adverse effects on vision. Prior to development of the new mouse model, Dr. Guy s lab had shown that they could produce temporary signs of LHON in mice. They were able to prevent development of LHON in the mice, but not reverse it.  Now we ve shown that we can improve visual function after it s been lost,  he said.","Published: October 6, 2015"

The company aims to launch the drug as the successor to the drugs currently available on the market. The active ingredient is based on drugs that have already been clinically investigated   MEK inhibitors   and is designed to avert the risk of resistance and to show efficacy over a longer timeframe than current products. The founding team and scientific board are made up of renowned scientists and experienced executives from the pharmaceutical industry. The flu season starts in autumn and the first calls for vaccination, such as that of the Robert Koch Institute, start to appear in the media at this point. Indeed, viral flu, or influenza, is highly contagious, and seasonal epidemics can become pandemics. Every year, up to ten percent of the adult population are infected by the influenza A virus, which proves fatal to an average of 500,000 people, who are usually elderly or patients with pre-existing conditions such as a weakened immune system. In the western industrialized nations, a maximum of 40 percent of the population is protected by vaccinations, and only insistent calls succeed in raising this figure slightly. People who come down with real flu are usually given a flu drug as treatment. Dr. Rainer Lichtenberger, CEO of the start-up Atriva Therapeutics GmbH in T bingen believes there is a drawback to this approach: ""The leading licensed drug is only effective when taken within a day of infection and, what s more, a lot of flu viruses are already resistant to it."" That is why a group of renowned university scientists led by T bingen-based influenza expert and virus researcher Prof. Oliver Planz and his colleagues Prof. Stephan Ludwig from M nster and Prof. Stephan Pleschka from Giessen has, for several years, been carrying out successful research on a completely new flu treatment based on MEK inhibitors, which act on the cellular enzyme MEK. Their work is the foundation on which Atriva Therapeutics GmbH is being established. MEK inhibitors are a highly promising anti-viral treatment that blocks the signal factors in human cells that the virus needs in order to multiply. They are currently used primarily to treat cancers, where they block uncontrolled signalling in the cells that promote the growth of tumour cells. MEK inhibitors are already licensed as a treatment for tumours. The team of researchers at Atriva developed the idea of using signal inhibitors that act against tumours to counter influenza viruses, as infections with influenza viruses also activate a range of intracellular signalling paths. In fact, a number of pre-clinical studies has already shown that MEK inhibitors are highly effective against influenza virus infections as well as other viral infections. The approach taken by Atriva also impressed the regional BioRegio STERN Management GmbH during the Science2Start ideas competition in 2013. The company was founded in spring 2015 in T bingen, which   in the words of Dr. Lichtenberger   is ""one of the most vibrant and agile biotechnology locations in Germany"". So far, the company has been financed solely by its founders, but it hopes to secure risk finance amounting to 15 million euros by 2016   until then, none of the founders is taking remuneration for their activities for the company. ""This financing should secure the first clinical trial phase up to 2019,"" explains Lichtenberger, who   along with Emilie Hofstetter, Dr. Sebastian Canisius, Rolf Naumann and Dr. Henrik Luessen   brings a great deal of pharma-specific entrepreneurial expertise to the start-up. There are still a few years and intensive trials to get through before the drug can be introduced into the market. ""These clinical studies are essential,"" explains Lichtenberger. ""After all, our drug is to be used by millions of people around the world and will set a new standard in the treatment of flu."" The company expects to make hundreds of millions in annual sales five years after the world-wide market launch   unless an international pharmaceutical group snaps it up in the meantime.","Published: October 6, 2015"

The prize recognizes Dr. Hobbs  research, which advances understanding of heart disease and other complex disorders. The work of Dr. Hobbs, Director of the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development at UT Southwestern and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, is credited with leading to new therapeutics to lower LDL cholesterol. The international award from Rockefeller, which celebrates the achievements of outstanding women in biomedical science, was established by Dr. Paul Greengard, a biophysicist and Vincent Astor Professor at the university, and his wife, Ursula von Rydingsvard, a sculptor. The $100,000 annual prize is named in honor of Dr. Greengard s mother, who died giving birth to him. It is funded by Dr. Greengard s donation of his monetary share of the 2000 Nobel Prize in Medicine, as well as donations from other generous Rockefeller supporters.  Dr. Hobbs  work is nothing short of inspirational   she is unraveling the genetic underpinnings of cardiovascular disease and changing the way we look at one of the most common, complex health issues of our time,  said Dr. Greengard. Since 1999, Dr. Hobbs has led the Dallas Heart Study, a longitudinal, multiethnic, population-based investigation of risk factors underlying cardiovascular disease, the nation s leading cause of death for both men and women. The study, originally funded by the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation, involves thousands of participants and the meticulous collection of data on traits that could be linked to genes involved in heart disease.  Dr. Hobbs is an outstanding physician-scientist and a highly respected member of our faculty. Her insights as a clinician have guided the direction of expertise gained through rigorous basic science training to address truly important questions at the focal point of the most important medical challenges of our day,  said Dr. Daniel K. Podolsky, President of UT Southwestern.  The Dallas Heart Study which she conceived and has led since its inception, encompassing a carefully characterized cohort of individuals that reflect the full diversity of our population followed over time, has proved to be a virtually unique and powerful resource to define the genetic basis of human biology and disease, including mechanisms controlling cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism. Through the application of the power of genetics, the Dallas Heart Study will undoubtedly continue to be an engine for discovery for decades to come,  added Dr. Podolsky, who holds the Philip O Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Presidential Chair in Academic Administration, and the Doris and Bryan Wildenthal Distinguished Chair in Medical Science.  This is a wonderful honor,  said Dr. Hobbs, also Professor of Internal Medicine and Molecular Genetics.  This prize recognizes the work I have done with Professor of Internal Medicine, Dr. Jonathan Cohen, and the many terrific students and fellows in my laboratory.  I also want to thank my colleagues and mentors for UT Southwestern s collaborative, intellectually stimulating environment. Special thanks to Chairman Emeritus of Internal Medicine Dr. Donald Seldin, who single-handedly changed the course of my career by suggesting I try basic research, and Nobel Laureates Dr. Michael Brown and Dr. Joseph Goldstein, for the tough, rigorous yet supportive environment in which I trained as a scientist,  added Dr. Hobbs, who holds the Philip O Bryan Montgomery Jr., M.D., Distinguished Chair in Developmental Biology, the Eugene McDermott Distinguished Chair for the Study of Human Growth and Development, and the [1995] Dallas Heart Ball Chair in Cardiology Research. At a time when the scientific community was focused on identifying common genetic variations that impact human health, Dr. Hobbs and Dr. Cohen - with whom she runs a joint laboratory - designed the genetics section of the Dallas Heart Study to test the hypothesis that rare or low-frequency genetic variants might prove promising in the study of heart disease and other complex disorders. Their rare variant approach is now emulated by researchers worldwide. Using that approach, they identified a rare variant found in a small percentage of African-Americans. They reported that individuals who have one copy of that genetic variant, which inactivates the PCSK9 gene, have a 28 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol - the cholesterol type linked to heart disease. These individuals, who have lower LDL from birth, have a striking 88 percent reduction in heart disease compared to those without the rare variant. Next, Drs. Hobbs and Cohen identified a study participant s daughter who carries two of the inactivating PCSK9 mutations. Her plasma LDL cholesterol level is exceedingly low (14 mg/dL) and yet she is very healthy. These findings are credited with sparking a race among pharmaceutical companies to develop cholesterol-lowering PCSK9 inhibitors. The FDA recently approved the first two drugs in that class, aimed at patients who are either unable to take cholesterol-lowering statin drugs or unable to reach cholesterol goals with them. A UT Southwestern faculty member since 1987, Dr. Hobbs majored in human biology at Stanford University and earned her medical degree at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland. The Boston native completed an internship in internal medicine at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City before coming to UT Southwestern in 1980, where she finished her clinical training and served as chief resident in internal medicine at Parkland Memorial Hospital. Dr. Hobbs made the transition to physician-scientist at the urging of her UT Southwestern mentor, Dr. Seldin. He had recommended she pursue basic research in the joint laboratory of Dr. Brown, now Director of the Erik Jonsson Center for Research in Molecular Genetics and Human Disease, and Dr. Goldstein, Chairman of Molecular Genetics. During her time in their laboratory, her mentors won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1985 for their discovery of the underlying mechanisms of cholesterol metabolism, which led to the development of the blockbuster statin class of drugs. Among Dr. Hobbs  many honors, she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2007, to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006, and to the National Academy s Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) in 2004. Other honors include the American Heart Association s Clinical Research Prize, the Heinrich Wieland Prize, the American Heart Association Distinguished Scientist Award, and the inaugural Prize in Atherosclerosis Research from the International Atherosclerosis Society. The Greengard Prize will be presented to Dr. Hobbs by television host and political commentator Rachel Maddow. Past presenters include former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O Connor, author Joan Didion, broadcast journalist Andrea Mitchell, and the former president of Ireland, Mary Robinson. As part of the award ceremony, Dr. Hobbs will deliver Rockefeller s Women in Science lecture on Nov. 18.","Published: October 6, 2015"

In the mouse study, researchers found that TRPV1 controls the nerves that release noradrenaline and affect core body temperature. This opens the doors for the development of new strategies to treat the effects of stress on the body. ""The findings of our study give a greater insight into how body temperature is controlled, vital to improving the control of core body temperature in situations such as anesthesia, drug overdose and diseases in which core body temperature is pathologically abnormal,"" said Julie Keeble, Ph.D., a researcher involved in the work from the Institute of Pharmaceutical Science at King's College in London, England. To make this discovery, Keeble and colleagues conducted experiments using normal mice and mice bred to have no TRPV1 protein in their bodies. Drugs that blocked TRPV1 were administered to normal mice and their body temperature increased. The same drugs had no effect in the genetically altered mice. Normal mice that were given drugs that blocked the effects of noradrenaline before giving the TRPV1 blocker demonstrated a much smaller increase in body temperature. The genetically altered mice surprisingly showed a normal body temperature under normal conditions, which led to further study. The researchers found that the ""fight or flight"" response in the mice was reduced, including after administration of amphetamine, which is known to increase levels of noradrenaline. ""This protein, TRPV1, present on our nerve cells, has been known to control pain. Now we learn that it is also critical for controlling body temperature in response to stress hormones like adrenaline,"" said Gerald Weissmann, M.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal.

Smith, an assistant professor of bioengineering at Illinois.  Previously light emission had an unknown correspondence with molecule number. Now it can be precisely tuned and calibrated to accurately count specific molecules. This will be particularly useful for understanding complex processes in neurons and cancer cells to help us unravel disease mechanisms, and for characterizing cells from diseased tissue of patients.   Fluorescent dyes have been used to label molecules in cells and tissues for nearly a century, and have molded our understanding of cellular structures and protein function. But it has always been challenging to extract quantitative information because the amount of light emitted from a single dye is unstable and often unpredictable. Also the brightness varies drastically between different colors, which complicates the use of multiple dye colors at the same time. These attributes obscure correlations between measured light intensity and concentrations of molecules,  stated Sung Jun Lim, a postdoctoral fellow and first author of the paper,  Brightness-Equalized Quantum Dots"".According to the researchers, these new materials will be especially important for imaging in complex tissues and living organisms where there is a major need for quantitative imaging tools, and can provide a consistent and tunable number of photons per tagged biomolecule. They are also expected to be used for precise color matching in light-emitting devices and displays, and for photon-on-demand encryption applications. The same principles should be applicable across a wide range of semiconducting materials.  The capacity to independently tune the QD fluorescence brightness and color has never before been possible, and these BE-QDs now provide this capability,  said Lim.  We have developed new materials-engineering principles that we anticipate will provide a diverse range of new optical capabilities, allow quantitative multicolor imaging in biological tissue, and improve color tuning in light-emitting devices. In addition, BE-QDs maintain their equal brightness over time while whereas conventional QDs with mismatched brightness become further mismatched over time. These attributes should lead to new LEDs and display devices not only with precisely matched colors better color accuracy and brightness but also with improved performance lifetime and improved ease of manufacturing.

T-cells have a protein on their surface that the virus attaches to and uses to invade the cell. A team co-led by David Rawlings, a physician and professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington and the Seattle Children s Research Institute, used an enzyme that works like  molecular scissors  to snip out a key gene. Removing that gene causes the T-cells to stop making the receptor protein, making them less vulnerable to the virus.Then the researchers say they used a non-infectious virus as a vehicle to insert a new gene into the gap. The transformed T-cells then become HIV hunters, going after infected cells. Rawlings says some of these techniques have been tried before, but never with this level of precision and efficiency.  The efficiency has been very low, probably in the 1 to 2 percent range. The approach we used is much more efficient. We ve introduced these genes into about 60 percent of the T-cells,  Rawlings said. Researchers say the technique could have other applications too, such as training T-cells to go after tumors. Some of the mechanisms have been tested in humans, such as the disruption the T-cells  HIV receptors. But the human trials have not yet examined the one-two punch of deleting that gene and replacing it with the HIV-targeting gene. So far that combination has only been demonstrated in mice and in tissue samples, with additional animal and human research still needed.  Hans-Peter Kiem, who uses similar techniques at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center but wasn t involved in the study, called it  quite a significant advance in the field.  Kiem says he s excited about some of the broader implications, including the possibility of fighting cancer and other conditions.

Getting them to mimic normal adult cells   a critical step for eventually using them to test drugs   requires tension and a specific shape. The heart is never quite at rest, and it turns out that even in a lab heart cells need a little of that tension. Without something to pull against, heart cells grown from stem cells in a lab dish fail to develop normally. In addition to discovering the important role that tension plays in growing heart cells outside of the body, Stanford engineers have found that lab-grown heart cells contract more strongly when grown in long, thin shapes. Beth Pruitt, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and senior author on the study, said that stem cells have held promise as a source of human heart cells, and for almost a decade scientists have been able to grow them into beating structures in the lab. ""But getting them to look like normal human adult heart muscle cells has been difficult,"" she said.These findings are also important for scientists who have hoped to use human heart cells as a way of testing drugs for side effects before they are prescribed to people. Drugs are traditionally tested in animal heart cells, but given the many differences between humans and animals, those cells don't always detect drugs that could damage human hearts. Pruitt and postdoctoral scholar Alexandre Ribeiro recently reported the biomechanical conditions for producing normal adult heart cells in the lab  along with colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco, and the Gladstone Institutes. Taking shape Within the heart, muscle cells are long and thin, intertwining to spread signals and beat in rhythm. In the lab, heart cells take on a variety of shapes depending on the conditions in which they are grown. The cells fail to form the kinds of internal structures of normal heart cells, and although they do beat, they don't hold a steady rhythm. ""We jokingly call those 'arrhythmia in a dish,'"" said Pruitt. Pruitt and her colleagues at the Stanford University School of Medicine began working on the problem of how to develop more normal looking heart cells through a Stanford Bio-X grant in 2010. At the time, their goal was to find ways of probing the mechanics of normal heart cell contraction. They were laying the cells on lab dishes covered in tiny posts, then measuring how much force the cells put on those posts. ""One thing we learned from that work is that cells don't stick where you want them to,"" Pruitt said. They did manage to grow some cells that looked more normal than the usual beating blobs, but they didn't look like adult heart cells and produced much lower force. From that beginning, the team went on to develop better mechanical techniques that allowed them to measure force without the posts. In his work, Ribeiro matured stem cells into heart cells. He then forced those cells to take on a variety of shapes by putting them on lab dishes containing defined shapes of a material that the cells are able to stick to. Those shapes ranged from a square to rectangles of various dimensions. Ribeiro found that as the rectangle grew longer and narrower, the structures within the cells began to look more like a normal heart muscle, with the long contractile fibers within the cell nicely lined up. The cells also beat more forcefully. In addition to tweaking the cell shape, Ribeiro grew the cells on three biomaterials that were under different degrees of tension. One surface mimicked the looser tension of the developing heart, another was the tension of the normal heart and the third mimicked a stiff, diseased heart. The cells looked more normal and contracted most forcefully under the Goldilocks tension of the normal heart, he said. Anything looser and the cells didn't develop normally. These also contracted less forcefully, and the internal fibers buckled and bent between contractions. On firmer materials, cells contracted less forcefully and the fibers sometimes ruptured when trying to contract. ""We keep seeing in more studies that there is a certain blood pressure range in people where the heart is healthiest for longest,"" said Pruitt. ""I think we're seeing that mirrored at the cell scale."" Testing drugs Ribeiro said that in addition to providing a better source of cells for drug testing, their technique includes a way of visually detecting when cells are contracting properly. Until now, the gold standard for measuring contraction has involved painstakingly attaching small electrodes to the animal cell. ""We hope this can be a drop-in replacement for animal cells, and potentially instead of having to do individual recordings from each cell we could use video analysis,"" Ribeiro said. Visual analysis would make it significantly easier to test drugs on large numbers of cells. The team was working with stem cells that were derived from human tissues such as skin, also called induced pluripotent stem cells or iPS cells. One advantage of working with these cells, beyond their ability to form new tissues, is the fact that scientists can sequence the DNA of the person who donated that tissue sample and look for mutations that are known to be associated with heart disease. This step allows scientists to test drugs only on cells generated from people with no predisposition to heart disease, or to induce specific mutations to see how they predispose the cells to disease.

As we grow, our brain cells develop different genomes from one another, according to new research from Harvard Medical School and Boston Children s Hospital. The study shows for the first time that mutations in somatic cells that is, any cell in the body except sperm and eggs are present in significant numbers in the brains of healthy people. This finding lays the foundation for exploring the role of these post-conception mutations in human development and disease. A lot of people have been asking lately whether somatic mutations contribute to a range of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, but they couldn t answer the question because of the limitations of technology,  said the study s co-senior author, Peter Park, associate professor of biomedical informatics at HMS. The research team was able to make headway on the problem by combining single-cell genome sequencing with rigorous data analysis techniques. Already, the researchers have discovered that somatic mutations appear to occur more often in the genes a neuron uses most. They have also been able to trace brain cell lineages based on patterns of mutation.  These mutations are durable memory for where a cell came from and what it has been up to,  said the study s co-senior author, Christopher A. Walsh, the HMS Bullard Professor of Pediatrics and Neurology and chief of the Division of Genetics and Genomics at Boston Children s.  This work is a proof of principle that if we wanted to, and if we had unlimited resources, we could actually decode the whole pattern of development of the human brain.   I believe this method will also tell us a lot about healthy and unhealthy aging as well as what makes our brains different from those of other animals,  Walsh added. Taking a history Germline, or inherited, mutations have taken most of the blame for causing diseases and disorders of the brain, including Alzheimer s, autism and schizophrenia. The role of non-inherited mutations in somatic cells has been murkier. Until recently, scientists didn t even know if they existed in the brain in amounts great enough to matter.  Single-cell technology was essential for finding them,  said Walsh. Walsh, Park and team studied a particular kind of somatic mutation called single nucleotide variants. Each variant may occur in just a few cells, or even just one, so they can be hard to detect with whole-genome sequencing analyses that average hundreds of thousands of cells. Sequencing individual cells brings the rare mutations to light. The downside is that it costs just as much to sequence the genome of one cell as it does to sequence the genome of an entire person. Working within this limitation, the researchers were able to sequence 36 neurons sampled from the cerebral cortices of three deceased people without brain disease, aged 15, 17 and 42. The researchers found that each neuron contained about 1,500 single nucleotide variants. For each person, the researchers compared the neurons  genetic sequences to one another and to the individual s heart cells. This allowed them to start figuring out which mutations were shared by which neurons and which could be found elsewhere in the body. They then conducted tests in several parts of the brain to see how many cells in each region carried the same mutations as the neurons they d sequenced. Grouping neurons based on their mutations provided clues about cell history, because neurons that shared mutations likely came from the same stem-cell ancestor. If only a few cells shared a mutation, they probably belonged to a lineage that split more recently.  If a mutation arose very early, it would be present both inside and outside the brain. Or if it arose later, it would be in certain parts of the brain and not others,  said Walsh.  We re looking at a record of the series of cell divisions that generated the brain.  Based on patterns of mutation as well as location in the brain, some neurons  lineages could be traced back to a specific day during embryonic development. Use it and lose it Many phenomena can create somatic mutations. Ultraviolet light causes them in skin cells. Errors in DNA replication cause them in rapidly dividing cancer cells.  What we found in the brain was neither of those things,  said Walsh.  We thought the dominant source of mutation would be faulty DNA replication and were surprised to find that instead, it s faulty DNA expression.  Park s data analysis revealed that the genes with the most mutations tended to be the ones that were used most in the brain.  People like to say about your brain,  use it or lose it.  Unfortunately, we found there s a certain element of  use it and lose it,  said Walsh.  Every time you turn on a gene, there is at least some level of risk.  The findings make the team wonder whether somatic mutations accumulate with age and might contribute to neurodegeneration. They plan to investigate how, when and why these mutations arise in the brain; explore whether having a variety of mutations is damaging or protective; determine if mutation rates vary from person to person; and study additional types of somatic mutations in the brain and other tissues. As he helps to uncover the role of somatic mutations in the brain, Park has taken in stride the knowledge that our brains contain a multitude of genetic variation.  I m full of mutations but I m walking around, pretty healthy,  said Park.  It just goes to show that there are a lot of things we don t understand. ","Published: October 5, 2015"

The molecular characteristics of these killer cells were unknown until recently. Now, for the first time, a team from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has managed to create a molecular profile of the protective cells. By studying these immune cells from patients' blood, the researchers were able to predict the course of infections. The immune system defends us against pathogens and cancer cells. As it does so, it forms immune cells that attack and kill infected cells or cancer cells in a very targeted way, typical of the action of pathogens. This is why they are also known as killer cells. Until now, in the event of infection, it was difficult to predict how many of these killer cells would be active, and therefore how effectively the body could fight the disease.Characteristic markers for killer cells  ""Assessing a patient's ability to control an infection has always been a protracted process, because there were no markers to reliably label killer cells   the real 'task force' of the immune system,"" explains Prof. Percy Knolle, head of the Institute for Molecular Immunology & Experimental Oncology at TUM University Hospital Klinikum rechts der Isar. ""Yet this type of prediction is extremely important for selecting a suitable course of treatment."" Percy Knolle and his team have now managed to identify a marker for killer cells for the first time. The scientists found a molecule   the CX3CR1 receptor   occurring only on the surface of these killer cells. They first demonstrated this in infection models with mice, and then verified their findings in a human patient study. Fewer killer cells in chronic infections In some patients, viral infections such as Hepatitis B can become chronic i.e. a certain amount of the virus remains permanently in the body. The immune system cannot control the infection and the disease is not completely cured. The scientists asked themselves whether the reason for this could lie with the killer cells. To find out, they used their newly discovered marker. They launched a patient study with participants who had chronic hepatitis infections and discovered that these patients had only a very small number of killer cells targeting the hepatitis viruses. By contrast, the patients had developed many killer cells against other viral infections that they had overcome during the course of their lives. ""It appears that the lack of specific killer cells is the reason why some infections become chronic and the patients are unable to effectively kill off the viruses,"" explains the scientist. Percy Knolle sees great potential in the results: ""The new marker will make predictions about the course of infections much faster and more precise. All we need to do is take blood from the patient and identify the number of killer cells using the new marker."" This would allow suitable treatment to be initiated at an early stage, he explains.","Published: October 5, 2015"

A study led by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center has opened up yet another avenue for understanding the biological reasons why some people live longer or respond better to treatment   RNA editing events. An assessment of 6,226 samples from patients with 17 different cancer types taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas has revealed new information about RNA editing events in tumors versus normal tissue, and provided evidence that RNA editing could selectively affect drug sensitivity. RNA editing is the process where genetic information is altered in the RNA molecule. Once thought rare in humans and other vertebrates, RNA editing is now recognized as widespread in the human genome.  These results highlight RNA editing as an exciting theme for investigating cancer mechanisms, biomarkers and treatments,  said Han Liang, Ph.D., associate professor of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.  In this study, we identified an appreciable number of clinically relevant editing events, many of which are in non-coding regions.  Liang said that specific RNA editing processes, adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I), are plentiful in the human genome but have not been investigated in depth. The study provided new detail on this little understood biological phenomenon that may have significant clinical relevance.  If a protein is only highly edited in the tumor proteins, but not in normal proteins, then it s possible that a specific drug could be designed to inhibit the edited mutant protein,  said Liang.  Previous studies have focused on DNA mutations and mainly focused on RNA editing in normal tissues. The role of RNA editing in human cancers is only beginning to emerge from those early studies of individual patient samples in a few cancer types.  The larger scale Cancer Genome Atlas study provided the information needed to alter proteins or RNA sequences that may act as  drivers  for prognostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets. RNA editing adds another layer of complexity in the quest to predict patient survivability and suggest new therapies, said Liang.","Published: October 5, 2015"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/escape-prevention-193683,Escape Prevention Studying flu virus structure brings us a step closer to a permanent vaccine  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Why do you need a new flu shot every year, when most other vaccines give long-lived or even lifelong immunity? The reason is that the influenza virus can mutate as it spreads from person to person, so the variety of virus that shows up next year will be different from the one you might have suffered from this year. These differences allow the virus to  escape  the protective immunity that people acquire by recovering from an infection or getting last year s vaccine. Researchers have been trying to develop a flu vaccine that confers longer-lasting immunity, not least because predicting the next year s strain is often inaccurate. Recent work led by the laboratory of Stephen Harrison, the Giovanni Armenise Harvard Professor of Basic Biomedical Science at Harvard Medical School, takes us one step closer toward this goal.Protection against the flu comes from antibodies that bind to the virus and block it from infecting a cell. Most protective antibodies recognize a protein on the surface of the influenza virus particle called hemagglutinin. The mutations that allow the virus to escape occur on the surface of hemagglutinin where the antibodies try to bind. However, two sites on hemagglutinin do not change, because mutations in those places would prevent the virus from infecting a cell. One of these two sites is where the virus attaches to a receptor on the cell surface. Researchers suspect that altering or blocking the hemagglutinin receptor site might prevent the virus from latching on to the cell despite mutations it evolves elsewhere. This would conceivably prevent flu infection for years.  Suppose we could develop a vaccine that stimulates a person s immune system to make antibodies targeting the receptor site. That person would gain a level of immunity that could resist influenza-virus escape,  said Harrison.  To figure out how to make a vaccine with such properties, however, we need to understand better than we do at present about how our immune system responds to a flu vaccine,  he said. It s now possible to obtain that information, thanks to contemporary technologies for studying the cells that make antibodies and for sequencing their DNA. Harrison s laboratory, in collaboration with investigators at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute at Duke University, discovered that some people indeed make antibodies that recognize the hemagglutinin receptor site. The team found that a person who participated in a vaccination study at Duke in 2008 made several different antibodies of this kind. The researchers used X-ray crystallography to work out exactly how the antibodies bind to hemagglutinin. Comparing the various structures, they realized that a person whose immune system is generating several such antibodies would be very unlikely to get infected, even by a new strain, because a mutated hemagglutinin that escapes protection by one antibody would not escape protection by another. The only points at which all the antibodies contact hemagglutinin are also points at which mutations would compromise the virus  ability to infect a cell. Harrison suggests that a useful goal for an improved flu vaccine would be one that stimulates a person s immune system to make receptor-site-directed antibodies, such as those he and his colleagues have characterized. He says that he finds the new results particularly gratifying because  experiments designed to probe fundamental properties of the human immune system are also suggesting potential new strategies for developing improved influenza vaccines.  The lessons learned might also apply to the development of vaccines against other rapidly changing viruses, such as HIV.","Published: October 5, 2015"

This research supports the hygiene hypothesis that we re making our environment too clean. It shows that gut bacteria play a role in asthma, but it is early in life when the baby s immune system is being established,  said the study s co-lead researcher B. Brett Finlay, Peter Wall Distinguished Professor in the Michael Smith Laboratories and the departments of microbiology & immunology and biochemistry and molecular biology at UBC. Asthma rates have increased dramatically since the 1950s and now affect up to 20 per cent of children in western countries. The discovery opens the door to developing probiotic treatments for infants that prevent asthma. The finding could also be used to develop a test for predicting which children are at risk of developing asthma. The researchers analyzed fecal samples from 319 children involved in the CHILD Study. Analysis of the gut bacteria from the samples revealed lower levels of four specific gut bacteria in three-month-old infants who were at an increased risk for asthma. Most babies naturally acquire these four bacteria, nicknamed FLVR (Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, Veillonella, Rothia),from their environments, but some do not, either because of the circumstances of their birth or other factors. The researchers also found fewer differences in FLVR levels among one-year-old children, meaning the first three months are a critical time period for a baby s developing immune system. The researchers confirmed these findings in mice and also discovered that newborn mice inoculated with the FLVR bacteria developed less severe asthma.  This discovery gives us new potential ways to prevent this disease that is life-threatening for many children. It shows there s a short, maybe 100-day window for giving babies therapeutic interventions to protect against asthma,  said co-lead researcher Dr. Stuart Turvey, pediatric immunologist, BC Children s Hospital, director of clinical research and senior clinician scientist at the Child & Family Research Institute, Aubrey J.

In addition, in a condition called Hirschsprung s disease or aganglionosis, where those neurons are not present, the team was able to replace them. The study   the first report on the enteric nervous system in human-derived tissue-engineered colon . In healthy intestines, food is moved along the digestive tract through peristalsis   a series of wave-like contractions. Special nerve cells called ganglion cells are required for this movement, but there is also a rich mixture of other types of nerve cells. In children with Hirschsprung s disease, these cells are missing. Without them, the intestine becomes blocked and surgical removal of the affected segment of colon is required.To help these and other children suffering from intestinal diseases that may require surgical removal of all or part of their intestine, the CHLA team   led by principal investigator Tracy C. Grikscheit, MD, a pediatric surgeon and researcher at The Saban Research Institute of CHLA   is developing tissue-engineered options for these children. One objective of growing tissue-engineered organs is to generate new tissue from a patient s own cells.  Grikscheit and her team first needed to determine what parts of the enteric nervous system were present in tissue-engineered colon when it is grown from normal human cells.  The diversity of neuron types that grew within the human tissue-engineered colon was a revelation to our team, because previously we had only documented that some ganglia were present,  said Grikscheit, who is also a tenured associate professor of Surgery at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.  The next step was to determine if these neuronal elements could be supplied to tissue-engineered colon that was missing neurons   like in Hirschsprung s disease.  The scientists initially grew cells from patients with Hirschsprung s disease and from mice with a genetic mutation that causes aganglionosis. In both cases, the tissue-engineered colon derived from these cells did not have the all-important components of the intestinal nervous system.  In a second set of experiments, again testing both mouse and human cells, the investigators added neurospheres, which are clusters of purified neural progenitor cells. The cells had been stained with green fluorescence, so the scientists could readily visualize where the nerve cells ended up in the tissue-engineered colon, as well as determine the source of the nerve cells.  After growing the colon for four weeks, we saw that the green nerve cells had been incorporated into the colon engineered from human tissue derived from a patient lacking those elements and that the different nerve subtypes were present,  said first author on the study, Minna Wieck, MD, an investigator and surgical resident at CHLA.","Published: October 5, 2015"

It is only now, however, that researchers at the University of Basel have discovered the molecular basis for this process. Their findings could have important implications for cancer research. Fibroblasts are motile constituents of the connective tissue and also regulate its stiffness. Moreover, fibroblasts play an important role in malignant skin diseases such as melanoma. In research, they serve as a model system for studying cell migration.Signaling pathway identified In the early 1950s, the English researcher Michael Abercrombie discovered that colliding fibroblasts repel one another and, in the process, change their direction of motion. He called this phenomenon  contact inhibition of locomotion . Although individual proteins were identified as key factors in this process, the molecular basis of this reaction remained something of a puzzle. In particular, it was unclear which repulsion signals were involved in the process, how these signals entered the cells from the outside, and how they influenced the cytoskeleton, which in turn regulates the cell s movement. Prof. Olivier Pertz s research group at the University of Basel has now precisely answered these questions. The group identified a coherent signaling axis consisting of three proteins called Slit2, Robo4, and srGAP2 which operates as follows:If the function of Slit2, Robo4, or srGAP2 is deactivated, colliding cells will stick to one another and will not separate as easily. A  molecular bumper  Intriguingly, the repulsion machinery is localized at the front    even in freely moving cells. By assembling this kind of a  molecular bumper , the cell is prepared for collision with another cell. Where exactly this bumper must be positioned   namely, only in parts of the cell that are moving forwards   is determined by the cell s geometry, which in turn is deciphered by srGAP2. The integration of membrane curvature and repulsion signals ensures that cell-cell repulsion takes place at the correct location. This repulsive reaction could play an important role in cancer metastasis. This is supported by the fact that the expression of Slit and Robo isoforms is deregulated in several  tumor types.","Published: October 5, 2015"

Screening is the most effective way to reduce the risk of dying from the disease, yet as a Penn Medicine physician argues in an editorial this week in the journal Gastroenterology, current recommendations to screen older people with a family history of colorectal cancer, specifically with colonoscopy every five years, is not justified for most patients. Chyke A. Doubeni, MD, MPH, chair of the department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, is the co-author of the editorial. Colorectal cancer which starts in the colon or rectum is most curable when detected early through screening, and can also be prevented by detecting and removing polyps. The past three to four decades has seen an uptick in screening in the U.S. and, along with it, fewer cases of the disease and fewer lives lost as a result. The editorial discusses the state-of-the-science in the context of a new study published in that issue of Gastroenterology that followed 144,768 men and women aged 55 to 74 for 13 years to determine the risk of colorectal cancer in those with a history of colorectal cancer in a first degree relative.  Current guidelines call for people of average risk, including those without a family history, genetic syndromes that are associated with high risk, or inflammatory bowel disease, to receive a screening colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 50, sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or stool occult blood test every year. Those with first-degree relatives who have colon cancer before age 60, or two or more immediate relatives at any age, are recommended to undergo a more aggressive screening regimen, of at least one colonoscopy every five years, starting at age 40, or 10 years earlier than their youngest relative s age at diagnosis. Many questions remain, however, about the point at which patients in all risk groups can cease aggressive screening. For patients with a family history, it has not been clear whether screening colonoscopy should be used at least every five years until age 75-85 when screening is usually recommended to stop.  The accumulated evidence shows that the risk of a colorectal cancer diagnosis in patients associated with having a family history of the condition becomes progressively smaller with increasing age, as does the association between family history and death from colorectal cancer,  Doubeni said.  Current standards recommend aggressive screening until age 75 to 85, but now a growing body of evidence show that it is not necessary to continue to screen most older people with a family history that aggressively.  In light of these findings, for patients over 55, particularly those 65 years and older, having only one immediate family member with colorectal cancer, Doubeni advocates for screening as recommended for average risk individuals (colonoscopy every ten years or other recommended screening test such as fecal immunochemical test every year). Those with two or more first degree relatives with the disease, he says, should continue to receive a colonoscopy more often until more evidence is available.","Published: October 5, 2015"

The study found new genes involved in stem cell regulatory networks and new subpopulations of cells, giving insights into stem cell pluripotency   the ability to develop into almost all different types of cell. The researchers also developed new resources for the stem-cell community, which will help interpret future investigations. Stem cells exist in a 'ground' state before something triggers them to develop into functional cells such as liver, heart or blood cells. What sparks that change has a lot to do with how, when and in what order the genes inside that cell are expressed, or turned on and off. Characterising the gene expression at play in stem cells is essential to understanding the fundamental biology of health and disease. It can also help in detecting genetic factors that figure into a person's response to a medicine. Researchers at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) used single-cell RNA sequencing technology to study the expression of thousands of genes in around 700 mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESCs), and found there is a signature 'gene expression mix' that characterises different cell populations. They also found this mix determines the length of the cell cycle. In other words, heterogeneity in gene expression across cells underpins cellular behaviour. ""You can take a kind of snapshot of this very dynamic process of gene expression, and infer a lot of information from it,"" explains Ola Kolodziejczk, a first author from the Sanger Institute and EMBL-EBI.""It's a bit like taking a picture of a crowd in Times Square at New Year's Eve from above, and ordering all of the individuals by age to get a sense of their life cycle, or grouping them by clothing style to infer which party they will go onto next."" Single-cell RNA sequencing helps researchers see what makes all the cells in our bodies take on different shapes, predict what they might do and explore the many elements that contribute to their fates. In this study, the team developed novel approaches to characterise how gene expression levels vary, stem cell by stem cell, in three different states. ""One really exciting thing was that we identified new genes involved in the stem-cell regulatory network, and validated our findings using the CRISPR technology,"" says Jong Kyoung Kim of EMBL-EBI. ""That brings us closer to inferring how the whole network is put together   and that in turn can give us insights into what keeps stem cells in a ground state and what triggers them to change."" By dissecting the noisy mix of gene expression cell by cell, the researchers uncovered a rare subpopulation of cells that express a couple of marker genes also expressed by cells at the two-cell stage of the embryo, which are able to develop into any cell type ('totipotent'). While the rare mESCs identified in this study only share some molecular features of the two-cell system, they will provide valuable resources to the study of early development.","Published: October 5, 2015"

Developing compounds that activate the receptors in this way may serve as a means to improve their therapeutic potential.  The study used a compound called isoquinolinone 2.1 to target the kappa opioid receptor, which is widely expressed in the central nervous system and serves to moderate pain perception and stress responses.

RURO is one of the leading companies in this area, with quadruple the number of cloud hosted deployments of the laboratory data management solution, Limfinity , since 2014.  RURO customers opt for cloud deployments for several reasons, but a lack of onsite IT availability is a primary issue for many. In large organizations, IT is often spread thin, may involve intensive procedural effort to obtain services, or present other challenges that must be overcome by individual laboratories in order to improve their sample management software tools. Similarly, in startups and other more autonomous laboratories, the cloud can be an easy way to gain powerful software support without the need for any IT staffing or hardware investment.   FreezerPro Cloud is the same commercial-of-the-shelf sample management system that is already used all across the world by thousands,  says Vlad Lebedev, RURO s Chief Executive Officer.  Over the years, many of our customers were able to adopt FreezerPro the same day that they purchased it. Now that process of improving sample management will be even more readily achievable - the FreezerPro Cloud does not require any installation process.  RURO is also reintroducing the  Basic  Edition of FreezerPro with the release of FreezerPro Cloud.  Basic  Edition will join  Standard  Edition and  Enterprise  Edition to provide choices to labs balancing budget concerns against software functionality needs.  RURO carefully crafted its cloud hosting service. Its hosting partners have nearly twenty data centers worldwide, ensuring that FreezerPro Cloud customers will always have optimized performance due to  nearby  hosting sites. Deployment across multiple regions is offered, affording high availability, and RURO guarantees 99.99% uptime with FreezerPro Cloud.  RURO s Cloud and accompanying services were developed over the past year as we completed Cloud-hosted Limfinity  deployments for some of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies; as well as centralized, globally accessed systems containing patient data and, therefore, requiring the utmost security and sensitivity to regulatory compliance,  says Maxim Didenko, RURO s Chief Technical Officer.  As a result, the FreezerPro  Cloud provides solid assurance to any customer concerned about regulation or data security.  Existing non-cloud FreezerPro  customers may contact RURO for information about moving their license to the Cloud. ","Published: October 5, 2015"

We are now able to see which proteins work together and where they are linked , explains Utrecht University Prof. Albert Heck.  This is essential in order to understand how proteins operate in a cell under healthy conditions, and what goes wrong in diseases.  The millions of proteins in our cells conduct all of the processes that regulate life, in constantly shifting interactions. These interactions are a lively dynamic of links between proteins - often numbering in the hundreds. Until recently, pharmaceuticals inhibited a single protein, but it is more effective to treat diseases by sabotaging the interactions between proteins. This is because the protein inhibited may actually have another useful, or even vital function in a healthy cell, which often results in undesirable side effects during treatment. Identifying all of the links at a single glance The technique for identifying the cooperation between proteins is called  cross-linking mass spectrometry . This technique has been available for some time, but until now it could only make these interactions visible if a small number of purified proteins were placed together in a small container. However, only a limited amount of information can be derived in such an artificial setting. But now, thanks to improvements in mass spectrometry sequence analysis and a new search algorithm, researchers can study all of the links between all of the proteins present in a cell at a single glance. From dozens to thousands  We ve managed to identify around 2,100 of these links, while before we were only able to map out tens or hundreds , according to Albert Heck, Professor of Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics at Utrecht University.  For example, we have identified more than 100 links in the ribosome, the machine that is responsible for protein synthesis in the cell. Plus, we ve been able to differentiate between the partners that collaborate with one another all the time from those with more superficial partnerships in this protein complex.

""Our lab is interested in microbial communities in the environment and, specifically, the symbiosis or mutually beneficial relationship between microorganisms that allows them to catalyze reactions they wouldn't be able to do on their own,"" says Professor of Geobiology Victoria Orphan, who led the recent study. For the last two decades, Orphan's lab has focused on the relationship between a species of bacteria and a species of archaea that live in symbiotic aggregates, or consortia, within deep-sea methane seeps. The organisms work together in syntrophy (which means ""feeding together"") to consume up to 80 percent of methane emitted from the ocean floor methane that might otherwise end up contributing to climate change as a greenhouse gas in our atmosphere. Previously, Orphan and her colleagues contributed to the discovery of this microbial symbiosis, a cooperative partnership between methane-oxidizing archaea called anaerobic methanotrophs (or ""methane eaters"") and a sulfate-reducing bacterium (organisms that can ""breathe"" sulfate instead of oxygen) that allows these organisms to consume methane using sulfate from seawater. However, it was unclear how these cells share energy and interact within the symbiosis to perform this task. Because these microorganisms grow slowly (reproducing only four times per year) and live in close contact with each other,  it has been difficult for researchers to isolate them from the environment to grow them in the lab. So, the Caltech team used a research submersible, called Alvin, to collect samples containing the methane-oxidizing microbial consortia from deep-ocean methane seep sediments and then brought them back to the laboratory for analysis. The researchers used different fluorescent DNA stains to mark the two types of microbes and view their spatial orientation in consortia. In some consortia, Orphan and her colleagues found the bacterial and archaeal cells were well mixed, while in other consortia, cells of the same type were clustered into separate areas. Orphan and her team wondered if the variation in the spatial organization of the bacteria and archaea within these consortia influenced their cellular activity and their ability to cooperatively consume methane. To find out, they applied a stable isotope ""tracer"" to evaluate the metabolic activity. The amount of the isotope taken up by individual archaeal and bacterial cells within their microbial ""neighborhoods"" in each consortia was then measured with a high-resolution instrument called nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS) at Caltech. This allowed the researchers to determine how active the archaeal and bacterial partners were relative to their distance to one another. To their surprise, the researchers found that the spatial arrangement of the cells in consortia had no influence on their activity. ""Since this is a syntrophic relationship, we would have thought the cells at the interface where the bacteria are directly contacting the archaea would be more active, but we don't really see an obvious trend. What is really notable is that there are cells that are many cell lengths away from their nearest partner that are still active,"" Orphan says. To find out how the bacteria and archaea were partnering, co-first authors Grayson Chadwick (BS '11), a graduate student in geobiology at Caltech and a former undergraduate researcher in Orphan's lab, and Shawn McGlynn, a former postdoctoral scholar, employed spatial statistics to look for patterns in cellular activity for multiple consortia with different cell arrangements. They found that populations of syntrophic archaea and bacteria in consortia had similar levels of metabolic activity; when one population had high activity, the associated partner microorganisms were also equally active consistent with a beneficial symbiosis. However, a close look at the spatial organization of the cells revealed that no particular arrangement of the two types of organisms whether evenly dispersed or in separate groups was correlated with a cell's activity. To determine how these metabolic interactions were taking place even over relatively long distances, postdoctoral scholar and coauthor Chris Kempes, a visitor in computing and mathematical sciences, modeled the predicted relationship between cellular activity and distance between syntrophic partners that are dependent on the molecular diffusion of a substrate. He found that conventional metabolites molecules previously predicted to be involved in this syntrophic consumption of methane such as hydrogen were inconsistent with the spatial activity patterns observed in the data. However, revised models indicated that electrons could likely make the trip from cell to cell across greater distances. ""Chris came up with a generalized model for the methane-oxidizing syntrophy based on direct electron transfer, and these model results were a better match to our empirical data,"" Orphan says. ""This pointed to the possibility that these archaea were directly transferring electrons derived from methane to the outside of the cell, and those electrons were being passed to the bacteria directly."" Guided by this information, Chadwick and McGlynn looked for independent evidence to support the possibility of direct interspecies electron transfer. Cultured bacteria, such as those from the genus Geobacter, are model organisms for the direct electron transfer process. These bacteria use large proteins, called multi-heme cytochromes, on their outer surface that act as conductive ""wires"" for the transport of electrons. Using genome analysis along with transmission electron microscopy and a stain that reacts with these multi-heme cytochromes the researchers showed that these conductive proteins were also present on the outer surface of the archaea they were studying. And that finding, Orphan says, can explain why the spatial arrangement of the syntrophic partners does not seem to affect their relationship or activity. ""It's really one of the first examples of direct interspecies electron transfer occurring between uncultured microorganisms in the environment. Our hunch is that this is going to be more common than is currently recognized,"" she says. Orphan notes that the information they have learned about this relationship will help to expand how researchers think about interspecies microbial interactions in nature. In addition, the microscale stable isotope approach used in the current study can be used to evaluate interspecies electron transport and other forms of microbial symbiosis occurring in the environment.","Published: October 5, 2015"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-hope-for-personalized-treatment-of-eczema-202642,New Hope for Personalized Treatment of Eczema Pharmaceutical researchers at Oregon State University have developed a new approach to treat eczema and other inflammatory skin disorders that would use individual tests and advanced science to create personalized treatments based on each person s lipid deficiencies  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A patent has been applied for on this system, which could revolutionize the treatment of eczema if it works as scientists believe it will. By identifying the specific problems each person has, moisturizers, skin protectants or other products or therapies could be created to address those specific problems. Aside from powerful steroid treatments that have a wide range of unwanted side effects, the primary existing treatments for eczema are ""one size fits all"" moisturizing or protective products, with little basis for understanding whether or not that's what an individual needs. Sometimes such products help, and often they are inadequate. In 2012 in the United States, about 15 million Americans struggled with eczema, or atopic dermatitis, accounting for about $1 billion in health care costs and 10-20 percent of all visits to a dermatologist. Eczema and some other skin disorders can be caused by a deficiency in lipids, which are various types of fat in the skin such as ceramides, cholesterol and free fatty acids, according to Arup Indra, an associate professor in the OSU College of Pharmacy and an expert on inflammatory skin disease. ""Lipids in our skin help retain moisture, they act like a blanket that protects against irritation and infection,"" Indra said. ""You could think of skin cells as the bricks of a wall, but lipids are the mortar that prevent things from getting through the cracks. When they are deficient, problems can develop."" Part of what makes eczema so difficult to treat, however, is that there are hundreds of lipids, serving various functions as a skin protector, barrier or antimicrobial agent - and every individual has a slightly different lipid composition. Most of the moisturizers now available are just random compositions of lipids that may or may not help address what is missing in a given individual. The new system created at OSU starts with surprising simplicity. A piece of tape is stuck to the skin and then pulled off, removing with it some skin cells. The painless procedure is totally noninvasive and could be used on anyone from infants to the elderly. Those skin and lipid samples are then analyzed with sophisticated mass spectrometry in a process created at OSU that literally produces a ""lipid fingerprint"" - a measurement of that person's skin and lipid profile. This profile can then be compared against those of healthy individuals, to help identify missing or deficient lipids that may be an underlying cause of the skin disorder. From that, various products or other therapies can be developed that would help replace or increase the lipids that are deficient in a person. They could be used topically like conventional moisturizers. OSU's research, the first of its type, has already shown that the lipid profiles of people with healthy skin often differ markedly from those with eczema or other inflammatory skin disorders. This offers further evidence that altered lipid composition in the skin of eczema patients may be a determinant of disease onset, progression and severity, the researchers said. ""We believe it's likely that supplementation with the lipids a person specifically needs will help address their skin problems and improve epidermal barrier function, and we plan to test that in continued research,"" Indra said. Findings in this area could also be used in veterinary medicine, the researchers said, since many pets such as cats and dogs also have skin disorders.","Published: October 5, 2015"

New Rutgers University research published in the Journal Neuroscience found that a drug   RGFP966   administered to rats made them more attuned to what they were hearing, able to retain and remember more information, and develop new connections that allowed these memories to be transmitted between brain cells.  Memory-making in neurological conditions like Alzheimer s disease is often poor or absent altogether once a person is in the advanced stages of the disease,  said Kasia M. Bieszczad, lead author and assistant professor in Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience in the Department of Psychology.  This drug could rescue the ability to make new memories that are rich in detail and content, even in the worst case scenarios.  What happens with dementias such as Alzheimer s is that brain cells shrink and die because the synapses that transfer information from one neuron to another are no longer strong and stable. There is no therapeutic treatment available that reverses this situation. The drug administered in this animal study is among a class known as HDAC inhibitors   used in cancer therapies to stop the activation of genes that turn normal cells into cancerous ones. In the brain, the drug makes the neurons more plastic, better able to make connections and create positive changes that enhance memory. Researchers found that laboratory rats, taught to listen to a certain sound in order to receive a reward, and given the drug after training, remembered what they learned and responded correctly to the tone at a greater rate than those not given the drug. Scientists also found that the rodents were more  tuned in  to the relevant acoustic signals they heard during their training   an important finding Bieszczad said because setting up the brain to better process and store significant sounds is critical to human speech and language.  People learning to speak again after a disease or injury as well as those undergoing cochlear implantation to reverse previous deafness, may also be helped by this type of therapeutic treatment in the future,  said Bieszczad.  The application could even extend to people with delayed language learning abilities or people trying to learn a second language.  This hypersensitivity in processing the auditory information enabled the neurons in the rats brains to reorganize and create new pathways   allowing more of the information they learned to become a long-term memory, said Bieszczad who collaborated with colleagues in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at the University of California Irvine.  People normally remember an experience with limited detail   not everything we see, hear and feel is remembered,  she said.  What has happened here is that memory becomes closer to a snapshot of the actual experience instead of being sparse, limited or inaccurate.

In the mouse study, researchers found that TRPV1 controls the nerves that release noradrenaline and affect core body temperature. This opens the doors for the development of new strategies to treat the effects of stress on the body. ""The findings of our study give a greater insight into how body temperature is controlled, vital to improving the control of core body temperature in situations such as anesthesia, drug overdose and diseases in which core body temperature is pathologically abnormal,"" said Julie Keeble, Ph.D., a researcher involved in the work from the Institute of Pharmaceutical Science at King's College in London, England. To make this discovery, Keeble and colleagues conducted experiments using normal mice and mice bred to have no TRPV1 protein in their bodies. Drugs that blocked TRPV1 were administered to normal mice and their body temperature increased. The same drugs had no effect in the genetically altered mice. Normal mice that were given drugs that blocked the effects of noradrenaline before giving the TRPV1 blocker demonstrated a much smaller increase in body temperature. The genetically altered mice surprisingly showed a normal body temperature under normal conditions, which led to further study. The researchers found that the ""fight or flight"" response in the mice was reduced, including after administration of amphetamine, which is known to increase levels of noradrenaline. ""This protein, TRPV1, present on our nerve cells, has been known to control pain. Now we learn that it is also critical for controlling body temperature in response to stress hormones like adrenaline,"" said Gerald Weissmann, M.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal.

Eurostars is a European Union funding programme that provides targeted support to market-oriented R&D collaborations pursued by small and medium-sized enterprises. In line with the goals of this programme, 4SC applied for funding together with two other epigenetics companies from France and Spain. 4SC's research project supported by Eurostars named ""EMTherapy"" will start in October 2015 and is scheduled to run for just under three years. In this project 4SC will conduct additional preclinical research into its two clinical epigenetic compounds - resminostat and 4SC-202. This research will involve cell culture and animal models to investigate the properties of resminostat and 4SC-202 as immunomodulators, and their potential combination with immunotherapy agents such as checkpoint inhibitors. Further research will also be conducted on their mechanisms of action and possible combinations with other cancer drugs and to identify other potential indications for clinical applications. Resminostat, 4SC's epigenetic lead compound, is an oral histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that has already been examined in preclinical and clinical trials in indications such as liver cancer, lung cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer and biliary tract cancer, and has shown promising activity as an immunomodulator in initial preclinical models. 4SC is currently preparing a clinical Phase II trial with resminostat in the indication of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Based on data from this study, 4SC will ideally be able to submit a filing for conditional approval for resminostat in the indication of CTCL in Europe. 4SC's second epigenetic compound 4SC-202, which has already undergone successful testing in a clinical Phase I trial in haematological tumours, possesses a unique mechanism of action, namely a combination of the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and the targeted combating of cancer stem cells. Enno Spillner, CEO of 4SC AG: ""Complementing the indications currently in clinical development for our two epigenetic drug candidates, we also see great potential for an immunomodulatory approach. Therefore, our goal is to use the grant money to conduct further research into resminostat and 4SC-202's 'Immune Priming' properties. Expressed simply, cancer cells have the ability to make themselves invisible to the patient's immune system, or to manipulate and weaken this system. We are now testing whether our compounds are able to restore tumour cell visibility for the immune system to either strengthen the immune system as it fights the cancer cells or improve the effectiveness of other immunotherapies. We published promising initial preclinical data on resminostat at the ITOC-2 conference back in March 2015 and these data were received with great interest."" Epigenetics is currently one of the most promising approaches in the fight against cancer. Epigenetics is a term used to describe functionally relevant changes to the genome which, unlike mutations, do not involve a change in the nucleotide sequence. Examples of epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation or histone modification, each of which alters how genes are expressed and consequently read or not read without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Alongside genetic mutations, epigenetic 'programming errors' are very often the reason why previously healthy cells subsequently turn cancerous. The idea is for epigenetic compounds to correct these mistakes in genetic regulation and thus interrupt or combat the mechanism that is responsible for the onset of cancer.","Published: October 3, 2015"

The article describes 13 different strategies to stop static and preserve accuracy, which can be particularly critical when dosing small amounts of potent, powdered substances. Electrostatic charges have the capacity to alter weighing results by as much as a few hundred milligrams. On a day-to-day basis in a pharma or chemical lab, however, the interplay of static between an object and weighing cell tends to be more subtle. Without even realizing it, an operator can produce solutions with inaccurate concentrations. These poorly-produced solutions negatively affect downstream lab and production processes. This new Mettler Toledo paper helps readers avoid these out-of-specification results with no- and low-cost fixes using everyday items and strategies to keep static from starting or help it dissipate, such as letting lab vessels rest after cloth-drying.

Genetic links to the seasonal clock Over the past decade, the role of rhythms whether daily or seasonal in disease has received a tremendous amount of attention in research and clinical applications. There is growing interest in how rhythms govern our sleep-wake cycles, metabolism and food consumption, along with our mood. Recent efforts to discover the genetics underlying natural variation in these physiological and behavioral processes may uncover how altered or disrupted rhythms may contribute to psychiatric disorders and other diseases. One such disorder, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), is characterized by seasonal mood changes which is typically seen as autumn or winter depression that spontaneously remits during spring and summer.   Two-drug combo helps older adults with hard-to-treat depression More than half of older adults with clinical depression don't get better when treated with an antidepressant. But results from a multicenter clinical trial that included Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis indicates that adding a second drug -- an antipsychotic medication -- to the treatment regimen helps many of those patients. The findings, from a study of 468 people over age 60 and diagnosed with depression, are published in The Lancet. The study was sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health and is the largest of its kind ever undertaken in older people with depression.   The neural mechanism of size constancy clarified A group of researchers at Osaka University found that neurons in the monkey visual cortical area V4*1, one of the areas in the visual cortex, calculate the size of an object based on information on its retinal image size and the distance from the object. The neural mechanism for the perceptual phenomenon in which size was perceived to be stable even if the distance from the object changed (known as size constancy) was unknown. Many neurons in the visual cortex change their activity according to the size of visual stimulus. It was believed that neurons responded to the size of the image formed on the eye (retinal image); however, size constancy cannot be achieved by such cells alone.   Connecting Alzheimer's disease and the immune system The role of the immune system in Alzheimer's disease is a hot topic, but exactly how the two are connected and what interventions could help lower risk remain a mystery. In a new study published in Nature Neuroscience, researchers in the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) investigate how genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease may influence a key type of immune cell. Their results lay the groundwork for designing better therapeutic strategies and better prediction tools for risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

The little balls of brain aren't performing any cogitation, but they produce electrical signals and form their own neural connections -- synapses -- making them readily producible testbeds for neuroscience research, the authors said. ""We think of this as a way to have a better in vitro [lab] model that can maybe reduce animal use,"" said graduate student Molly Boutin, co-lead author of the new paper in the journal Tissue Engineering: Part C. ""A lot of the work that's done right now is in two-dimensional culture, but this is an alternative that is much more relevant to the in vivo [living] scenario."" Just a small sample of living tissue from a single rodent can make thousands of mini-brains, the researchers said. The recipe involves isolating and concentrating the desired cells with some centrifuge steps and using that refined sample to seed the cell culture in medium in an agarose spherical mold. The mini-brains, about a third of a millimeter in diameter, are not the first or the most sophisticated working cell cultures of a central nervous system, the researchers acknowledged, but they require fewer steps to make and they use more readily available materials. ""The materials are easy to get and the mini-brains are simple to make,"" said co-lead author Yu-Ting Dingle, who earned her Ph.D. at Brown in May 2015. She compared them to retail 3-D printers which have proliferated in recent years, bringing that once-rare technology to more of a mass market. ""We could allow all kinds of labs to do this research."" The spheres of brain tissue begin to form within a day after the cultures are seeded and have formed complex 3-D neural networks within two to three weeks, the paper shows. There are fixed costs, of course, but an approximate cost for each new mini-brain is on the order of $0.25 (U.S.), said study senior author Diane Hoffman-Kim, associate professor of molecular pharmacology, physiology and biotechnology and associate professor of engineering at Brown. ""We knew it was a relatively high-throughput system, but even we were surprised at the low cost per mini-brain when we computed it,"" Hoffman-Kim said. Hoffman-Kim's lab collaborated with fellow biologists and bioengineers at Brown -- faculty colleagues Julie Kauer, Jeffrey Morgan, and Eric Darling are all co-authors -- to build the mini-brains. She wanted to develop a testbed for her lab's basic biomedical research. She was interested, for example, in developing a model to test aspects of neural cell transplantation, as has been proposed to treat Parkinson's disease. Boutin was interested in building working 3-D cell cultures to study how adult neural stem cells develop. Morgan's Providence startup company, MicroTissues Inc., makes the 3-D tissue engineering molds used in the study. Hoffman-Kim, who is affiliated with the Brown Institute for Brain Science and the Center for Biomedical Engineering, said she hopes the mini-brains might proliferate to many different labs, including those of researchers who have questions about neural tissue but not necessarily the degree of neuroscience and cell culture equipment required of other methods. ""If you are that person in that lab, we think you shouldn't have to equip yourself with a microelectronics facility, and you shouldn't have to do embryonic dissections in order to generate an in vitro model of the brain,"" Hoffman-Kim said.

In fact, we can often recognize a friend from a distance, even if he's walking with his back to us, because of his characteristic strides. Scientists have assumed that evolution would push us toward a single ""best"" method for walking--or for any movement. But even one person's repeated steps, watched closely, are rarely identical. ""Is this variability in walking just noise that the nervous system must overcome, or does it contribute to normal function?"" asks Hillel Chiel, a biology professor at Case Western Reserve University. Chiel worked with Case Western Reserve's Miranda J. Cullins, Jeffrey McManus, Hui Lu, and Kendrick Shaw, who are recent PhD graduates, and current PhD student Jeffrey Gill to find the answer. Their research, published in the journal Current Biology, suggests maintaining variability is essential both for normal behavior and for longer-term evolution. ""Most people see variation as a problem to get away from, but it is the solution,"" Chiel said. ""Our bodies change throughout life, and our nervous system handles variation to enable us to function as things change."" The findings have implications for rehabilitating those who have suffered injuries, debilitating illness or stroke; training athletes; and for building better robots. Gait and the human nervous and muscular systems that control it are highly complicated, so, to address variability, the researchers investigated swallowing motor patterns in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica. This sea slug is known for its large, identified neurons, which have been used to understand cellular and molecular mechanisms of learning and motivation. The team looked down to the level of motor neurons. The researchers removed sensory inputs from the slugs and looked at motor patterns in the animal's isolated brain. They found that the motor patterns varied more from one animal to the next than with sensory feedback. When the sea slug's sensors provide feedback as it feeds, all the slugs responded similarly--that is, it became harder to tell one slug from another just by looking at their motor patterns. Their response ranges were nearly identical when the movement was essential to swallowing, such as how long the feeding grasper was closed as it pulled seaweed into the mouth. Surprisingly, however, the researchers didn't find that feedback reduced variability within each sea slug. Just the opposite: the range of responses within each animal became broader. But how does increasing variability within individual animals reduce variability across the group? ""One way to reduce individuality is to give all the animals access to a broader range of responses--a common solution space,"" Chiel said. But having a range of options within that space is an advantage in a world that's constantly evolving, Chiel said. ""Darwin's big insight was that variation is the raw material that can be used to allow animals to adapt to a changing environment, and thus enhance their fitness."" Changes include those within each individual. A person who suffers a stroke, especially with disruption to sensory feedback, would benefit more from therapy to regain access to the full range of movement possibilities rather than training him or her to step one way, the researchers said. For training athletes, skills such as shooting free throws in basketball may improve by narrowing variability in that part of their body that must connect with the ball; but they may need to increase variability in other parts of their body at the same time to take full advantage of their body's special characteristics. Robots that have a built-in range of responses they can use to automatically adjust to variations in tasks would be more useful than those that must be reprogrammed to handle each change, the researchers said. Chiel's lab is now looking into whether their observation in sea slugs is relevant to vertebrates, including humans, and investigating cellular and synaptic mechanisms that allow sensory feedback to shape motor variability. ""We think that these results are not unique to slugs, but a general phenomenon for all animals,"" Chiel said. Research by others lends support and, ""We believe it's why we each have a different way of walking -- and why our unique individuality is so important for success in what we do.""

Insights from this research, published in Psychological Medicine, could help develop psychological interventions to assist people with schizophrenia to interpret social cues, which might also improve their symptoms. The researchers studied the behavior of 54 participants, including 29 people with schizophrenia, as they viewed the body position and gestures of an actor on a silent video clip. These included gestures such as putting a finger to the lips to indicate 'be quiet' or incidental movements such as scratching an eye. Example gestural video-clips in the left column and example incidental movements in the right column. Movements were performed towards (top row), ambiguously (middle row) or perpendicularly (away; bottom row) in relation to the viewer. Credit: King's College London They found that patients with schizophrenia are able to interpret meaningful gestures and incidental movements as accurately as healthy subjects. However, when the direction of the gestures was ambiguous (i.e. not obviously directed at or away from them), they were much more likely to misinterpret the gestures as being directed towards them. According to the researchers, this could indicate an increased tendency to self-infer these ambiguous social cues or to 'hyper-mentalize', whereby intent is falsely inferred from the actions of others. Both of these misinterpretations could underpin the incidence of paranoid thought experienced by patients with schizophrenia, suggest the study authors. The patients' confidence in their interpretation was found to be strongly associated with their propensity to experience hallucinatory symptoms. Professor Sukhi Shergill from the Department of Psychosis Studies, said: 'Humans are social beings, often finding joy in interacting with others. While most attention is on talking with each other, non-verbal behaviour such as gestures, body movement and facial expression also play a very important role in conveying the message. 'However, the message being conveyed is not always clear, or perceived as a positive one, and an extreme example is evident in patients suffering from schizophrenia who show a strong tendency to misinterpret the intentions of other people in a malevolent manner. 'Our study offers a basis for psychological interventions aimed at improving gestural interpretation. It could also provide guidance for health professionals and carers on how to communicate with patients who have schizophrenia, in order to reduce misinterpretations of non-verbal behavior.' Professor Shergill added: 'The recent advent of adaptable virtual-reality technology provides a means of investigating the psychological effects of gestural communication with greater flexibility, which may prove a boon for our future understanding of social deficits in schizophrenia.'

However, a group of scientists from University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and the University of Pennsylvania have developed a way to convert structural brain imaging techniques into  wiring diagrams  of connections between brain regions. Three researchers from UCSB s Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences   Michael Miller, Scott Grafton and Matt Cieslak   used the structure of neural networks to reveal the fundamental rules that govern which parts of the brain are most able to exert cognitive control over thoughts and actions. This study is the first to provide a mechanistic explanation for how the frontal cortex exerts control over the trillions of individual neurons that allow people to stay focused on one task or switch to a radically different one. The findings appear in the journal Nature Communications.  Particular regions of your brain are predisposed to control your thoughts based on where they lie in relation to other regions,  said Miller, a UCSB psychology professor and co-author of the paper.  The regions on the  outskirts  can perform a very specific kind of control. They can move the system to distant states, like switching from working at your job to playing with your kids.  This new research weds cutting-edge neuroscience with the emerging field of network science, which is often used to study social systems. By applying control theory   a field traditionally used to study electrical and mechanical systems   the investigators show that being on the outskirts of the brain is necessary for the frontal cortex to dynamically control the direction of thoughts and goal-directed behavior.   We need a basic theory of how the brain controls itself, and to get there, we suggest treating the brain as an engineering system,  said senior author Danielle Bassett, the Skirkanich Assistant Professor of Innovation in Penn s School of Engineering and Applied Science.  Cognitive control is a lot like engineering control: You model the system s dynamics by identifying key points; if I push on that one piece or pull this lever, I can offer a prediction of how it s going to affect other parts of the network.  By applying control theory equations to the wiring diagrams generated from brain scans, the researchers showed that the geographical and functional differences between regions of the brain are linked. While the analysis cannot say whether the frontal cortex s location or its role evolved first, it suggests that part of the frontal cortex s ability to control executive function depends on its distance from other parts of the brain network.   This study heralds a new wave of network science, grounded in rigorous control theory,  said co-author Grafton, director of UCSB s Brain Imaging Center.  When applied to state-of-the-art brain imaging data we begin to see some of the design tradeoffs inherent in the architecture of brain connections.  Regions that are most interconnected   and therefore more internal to the network  are very good at moving the brain into nearby states   for example, from writing someone an email to speaking with that person on the phone.  What s particularly interesting if we look at where those inner nodes are, they re all in  default mode  regions, which are the regions that are active when you re resting,  said Bassett, a former postdoctoral research associate in Grafton s Action Lab at UCSB.  This makes sense, because if you were engineering an optimal system, you would want to put its baseline where it can get to most of the places it has to go pretty easily.  According to co-author Cieslak, this type of holistic understanding of the relationship between brain regions  locations and their roles is necessary for tailoring better treatments for people who have lost executive function due to disease or injury. He noted that such fundamental understanding of how the brain controls its activity could help lead to better interventions for medical conditions associated with reduced cognitive control, such as autism, schizophrenia or dementia.

The majority of these mutations appear to arise while genes are in active use, after brain development is complete.  We found that the genes that the brain uses most of all are the genes that are most fragile and most likely to be mutated,  says Christopher Walsh, an HHMI investigator at Boston Children's Hospital who led the research. Walsh, Peter Park, a computational biologist at Harvard Medical School, and their colleagues reported their findings in the journal Science. It's not yet clear how these naturally occurring mutations impact the function of a normal brain, or to what extent they contribute to disease. But by tracing the distribution of mutations among cells, Walsh and his colleagues are already learning new information about how the human brain develops.  The genome of a single neuron is like an archeological record of that cell,  Walsh says.  We can read its lineage in the pattern of shared mutations. We now know that if we examined enough cells in enough brains, we could deconstruct the whole pattern of development of the human brain.  Cells of many shapes, sizes, and function are intimately intertwined inside the brain, and scientists have wondered for centuries how that diversity is generated. Scientists are further interested in genome variability between neurons due to evidence from Walsh's lab and others that mutations that affect only a small fraction of cells in the brain can cause serious neurological disease. Until recently, however, scientists who wanted to explore that diversity were stymied by the scant amount of DNA inside neurons: Although researchers could isolate the genetic material from an individual neuron, there was simply not enough DNA to sequence, so cell-to-cell comparisons were impossible. Walsh's team undertook its current study thanks to technology that has become available in the last few years for amplifying the full genomes of  individual cells. With plenty of DNA now available, the scientists could fully sequence an individual neuron's genome and scour it for places where that cell's genetic code differed from that of other cells. The scientists isolated and sequenced the genomes of 36 neurons from healthy brains donated by three adults after their deaths. For comparison, the scientists also sequenced DNA that they isolated from cells in each individual's heart. That effort yielded mountains of data, and Walsh s group teamed up with Park and Semin Lee, a postdoctoral fellow in Park's group, to make sense of it all. What they found was that every neuron's genome was unique. Each had more than 1,000 point mutations (mutations that alter a single letter of the genetic code), and only a few mutations appeared in more than one cell. What's more, the nature of the variation was not quite what the scientists had expected.  We expected these mutations to look like cancer mutations,  Walsh says, explaining that cancer mutations tend to arise when DNA is imperfectly copied in preparation for cell division,  but in fact they have a unique signature all their own. The mutations that occur in the brain mostly seem to occur when the cells are expressing their genes.  Neurons don't divide, and most of the time their DNA is tightly bundled and protected from damage. When a cell needs to turn on a gene, it opens up the DNA, exposing the gene so that it can be copied into RNA, the first step in protein production. Based on the types and locations of the mutations they found in the neurons, the scientists concluded that most DNA damage had occurred during this unwinding and copying process. While most of the mutations in the neurons were unique, a small percentage did turn up in more than one cell. That signaled that those mutations had originated when future brain cells were still dividing, a process that is complete before birth. Those early mutations were passed on as cells divided and migrated, and the scientists were able to use them to reconstruct a partial history of the brain's development.  We knew that cells that shared a certain mutation were related, so we could look at how different cells in the adult were related to each other during development,  explains Mollie Woodworth, a postdoctoral researcher in Walsh's lab. Their mapping revealed that closely relatedly cells could wind up quite distant from one another in the adult brain. A single patch of brain tissue might contain cells from five different lineages that diverged before the developing brain had even separated from other tissues in the fetus.  We could identify mutations that happened really early, before the brain existed, and we found that cells that had those mutations were nestled next to cells that had totally different mutations,  Woodworth says. In fact, the scientists found, a particular neuron might be more closely related to a cell in the heart than to a neighboring neuron. The scientists say intermingling cells with different developmental origins might protect the brain from the effects of early-arising, potentially harmful mutations. Although most of the mutations the scientists catalogued were harmless, they did encounter mutations that disrupted genes that, when impaired throughout the brain, can cause disease.  By having very mixed populations, cells that are next to each other and responsible for a similar task are not very closely related to each other, so they're not likely to share the same deleterious mutation,  says Michael Lodato, who is also a postdoctoral researcher in Walsh's lab. That could reduce the risk of a particular mutation interfering with a localized brain function, he explains. Still, the scientists say, this abundance of mutations could influence the function of a normal brain.  To what extent do these clonal mutations normally shape the development of the brain, in a negative way or a positive way?  says Walsh.  To what extent do we have a patch of brain that doesn't work quite right, but not so much that we would call it a disease? That's a big open question.

The new research findings focus on the role that the neurotransmitter serotonin plays in the development of social behavior. Serotonin, together with the serotonin receptors it activates in the brain, plays a significant role in neurological processes, including mood, anxiety, aggression and memory. The study made use of an animal model of mutations in the gene Pten, a risk factor present in a subgroup of individuals with autism. Treatment of this model with a drug that suppresses the activity of a particular serotonin receptor, 5-HT2cR, can have a dramatic effect.""Our research shows that targeting one specific serotonin receptor can reverse social deficits in a mouse model of the autism risk gene Pten,"" said Julien S journ , the first author of the new study. ""This discovery is important for understanding the role of this specific subtype of serotonin receptor in autism-relevant behaviors and could lead to new therapeutic strategies."" ""We found a striking contrast between the effects of dialing down the activity of the receptor using a drug, which improved social deficits in the Pten model, versus removing the receptor completely by mutation, which actually impaired social behavior,"" added TSRI Assistant Professor Damon Page, who led the study. ""Important issues will be uncovering the mechanism by which modulating serotonin receptor activity can influence autism-relevant symptoms and identifying the time window and dose range where targeting serotonin receptors is most effective."" Page was recently awarded a $2.4 million, five-year grant from the National Institute of Mental Health of The National Institutes of Health (NIH) to further study the relationship between abnormal patterns of brain growth, neurotransmitter signaling and the behavioral and cognitive symptoms in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. ""The new grant will let us expand our research into the relationship between specific risk factors, altered brain development and key neurotransmitter systems, with the ultimate goal of moving toward individualized treatments for particular subgroups of individuals with autism spectrum disorder,"" he said.","Published: October 2, 2015"

PROTACs, or proteolysis-targeting chimeras, are bifunctional small molecules that are designed to target proteins for degradation and removal from a cell. These molecules are intended to induce a cell s own protein-degradation machinery to bind to a particular protein and  label  it for degradation, thus removing that protein from the system entirely. This contrasts to a more traditional drug development approach that inhibits proteins, which provides transient benefit and works on about a quarter of the body s proteins. Arvinas  approach has the potential to radically expand the number of disease-causing proteins that can be targeted. James Sabry, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President of Global Head of Genentech Partnering, commented,  Genentech is very interested in protein degradation as a therapeutic approach to address difficult disease targets.

These manmade aerosols not only pollute the air, but also form an  atmospheric brown cloud  that s disrupting the local climate. A case in point is the South Asian summer monsoon, a complex system of winds that typically bring rain from the tropical Indian Ocean to most of the region, especially in the southwest and northeast. The aerosols, which block solar radiation and cool the ground before they get swept away by rain, have altered the monsoon considerably.In previous investigations of the local climate impact of aerosols present in the atmosphere during the onset of the summer monsoon, MIT researchers found that rainfall increased in the month prior to the monsoon (June) and decreased during the monsoon season (July and August). Now they have determined how aerosols emitted both before and during the monsoon are changing precipitation patterns.  Aerosols can influence the supply of moisture, and a small perturbation can play a big role,  says study co-author Chien Wang, a senior research scientist at MIT s Center for Global Change Science and in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.  Pre-monsoonal aerosols push rainfall to the northwest, drying out central India. Aerosols emitted during the monsoon season send the moisture supply in a different direction, and dry out most of the subcontinent.  The most dramatic consequences are enhanced flooding in the pre-monsoon season in the normally dry northwest regions of India and in Pakistan, and reduced agricultural output in central India, which now gets far less rainfall than usual during the monsoon season. The study produced its findings by running a global climate model to simulate the impacts of aerosols emitted before and during the monsoon season in all but the northeast region of India, which is not well-represented in the model. The effects of pre-monsoonal aerosols   increased rainfall in the northwest and decreased rainfall elsewhere, particularly in central India   persist during the monsoon, further reducing soil moisture in central India. Aerosols emitted during the monsoon lower rainfall totals not only in central India, but across the country. When aerosol emissions are simulated throughout both periods, impacts during the monsoonal period are similar to those resulting from monsoonal aerosols only.","Published: October 2, 2015"

Now, researchers can be sure that this particular stretch of our DNA plays a crucial role in the progression of the disease. In 2013, the World Health Organisation estimated that worldwide 584 000 people died from malaria, 90% of which were children under five living in Africa, while 198 million were infected. The research was conducted by MalariaGEN, an international network of scientists and clinicians spread across Africa, Asia and other malaria-endemic regions of the world, largely funded by the Wellcome Trust. In this study they analysed data from eight different African countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, The Gambia and Tanzania.  To identify the new locus, researchers performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that compared the DNA of 5,633 children with severe malaria with the DNA of 5,919 children without severe malaria. They then replicated their key findings in a further 14,000 children. The new locus they have identified is near a cluster of genes which code for proteins called  glycophorins  that are involved in the malaria parasite s invasion of red blood cells.  Although many different malaria resistance loci have been postulated over the years, this is one of very few that have stood up to stringent testing in a large multi-centre study; the others include the genes for sickle cell and the O blood group. A particularly strongly-protective variant, known in genetics as an 'allele', was found most commonly among children in Kenya in East Africa. Having this allele reduces the risk of severe malaria by about 40% in Kenyan children, with a slightly smaller effect across all the other populations studied. The authors speculate that this difference between populations could be due to the genetic features of the local malaria parasite in East Africa. Researchers have known for decades that the glycophorin cluster of genes is highly variable, but it was not possible to show that this genetic variation was responsible for protecting people against severe malaria. Now, with improved GWAS methodology, and the ability to collect samples from across different African countries, researchers are better able to understand the complexity in the patterns of DNA and, crucially, accurately measure their effects on an individual s level of resistance to the disease. Intriguingly, the new genetic resistance locus lies within a region of the genome where humans and chimpanzees have been known to share particular combinations of DNA variants, known as haplotypes. This indicates that some of the variation seen in contemporary humans has been present for millions of years. The finding also suggests that this region of the genome is the subject of 'balancing selection'. Balancing selection happens when a particular genetic variant evolves because it confers health benefits, but it is carried by only a proportion of the population because it also has damaging consequences.  The classic example is the sickle cell gene   people with one copy of the gene are strongly protected against malaria but those with two copies of the gene develop a life-threatening condition known as sickle-cell disease.  Professor Dominic Kwiatkowski, one of the lead authors of the paper, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, said: 'We can now say, unequivocally, that genetic variations in this region of the human genome provide strong protection against severe malaria in real-world settings, making a difference to whether a child lives or dies. 'These findings indicate that balancing selection and resistance to malaria are deeply intertwined themes in our ancient evolutionary history.   'This new resistance locus is particularly interesting because it lies so close to genes that are gatekeepers for the malaria parasite s invasion machinery.  We now need to drill down at this locus to characterise these complex patterns of genetic variation more precisely and to understand the molecular mechanisms by which they act.' Professor Ogobara K. Doumbo one of the co-authors from the Malaria Research and Training Center at the University of Bamako in Mali, said:  This type of discovery is made possible by a strong collaboration between malaria investigators in the field and northern collaborators who have the technology platform and the capacity to analyse big data. 'These findings provide new insights into the human and plasmodium genetic interaction that are determined by their co-evolution. How these findings could be used in public health settings, as a marker of individual and population risk of malaria infection, is the next step. Applying the findings in this way will only be possible by training a critical mass of African scientists in genomics and big data management and analysis. Both are addressed by the MalariaGEN Consortium and the next Wellcome Trust DELTAS Africa programmes.' Professor Kevin Marsh, a co-author of the study from the Kemri-Wellcome Research Programme in Kilifi, Kenya, said: 'This work is an excellent example of how genuine large-scale collaboration can tap into the power of modern genomic science. The risk of developing severe malaria turns out to be strongly linked to the process by which the malaria parasite gains entry to the human red blood cell. This study strengthens the argument for focusing on the malaria side of the parasite-human interaction in our search for new vaccine candidates.'","Published: October 2, 2015"

These molecules ensure that vital reactions, such as DNA replication or metabolism catalysis, are carried out within cells. When proteins die, the so-called process of denaturation takes place, which is accompanied by the unfolding of the native three-dimensional structure of the protein and hence the loss of its activity. By reassembling this polymer tangle back, it is possible to renature the protein and restore its activity, but this procedure requires much effort. Denatured proteins often pile up to form toxic aggregates, which is the underlying reason for many illnesses such as Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington. Therefore the investigation of denaturation and renaturation mechanisms cannot be overestimated.In a new study, David Avnir, professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and Vladimir Vinogradov, head of the International Laboratory of Solution Chemistry of Advanced Materials and Technologies at ITMO University, found that bringing proteins back to life is not only possible, but can be carried out with an improvement over their original activity. This strange phenomenon owes to a new technique of protein renaturation based on combining thermally denatured proteins (carbonic anhydrase) with a colloid solution of inorganic aluminum oxide nanoparticles. As the solution turns into a gel, the nanoparticles start binding together, exerting mechanical pressure on the protein molecules. As a result, each molecule ends up entrapped in its own individual porous shell, which prevents the malign process of protein aggregation and eventually restores their original spatial structure. Having compared the level of activity of proteins before denaturation and after renaturation, the chemists discovered that the resurrected ones were 180 percent more active than their native predecessors. ""Every protein molecule has its active center, which allows the molecule to interact with the environment. The active center, however, constitutes only 5 - 10 percent of the molecule surface,"" explains Vladimir Vinogradov. ""During renaturation we deal with a long unfolded molecule containing an active center and several extending tails. The active center and nanoparticles have similar charges and will repel, while the tails have an opposite charge and will gravitate towards the nanoparticles. In the end, when a shell forms around the molecule, the active center will be as far away from the wall of the shell as possible. Instead, the active center will be directed right into the pore in the shell, thus increasing the protein's chances to interact with the substrate."" Researchers say that this technique only works with unfolded denatured proteins. The orientation of native proteins within the shell cannot be controlled in the same way, because the active center can find itself anywhere, including facing the wall, which entirely excludes the possibility of interacting with the substrate. As professor David Avnir explains, one possible application of the discovery could help optimize the fabrication of drugs based on active proteins: ""Some of the most effective drugs are based on active proteins that are harvested from cell cultures. However, from all proteins grown in such a way only 20 percent are native and suitable for use, while the remaining 80 percent are the so-called inclusion bodies, that is, non-functioning denatured proteins. Obviously, knowing how to convert denatured proteins to their native state, and on top of it with increased level activity, would allow pharmaceutical companies to lower the price of many drugs making them more affordable.""","Published: October 2, 2015"

This device creates a unique way to develop more sustainable and cost-effective products, services and technologies which can accelerate innovation in a range of industries, from drug manufacturing to food and biodiesel production,  he said. According to Professor Raston, it is the VFD s ability to  streamline the loading of drugs into nano-packages for better results and less waste , that leaves traditional batch processing techniques in its wake. Professor Raston also says that using more effective drugs will reduce manufacturing waste, with up to half a tonne of waste generated from the production of just 1kg of many drugs, much of which ends up in sewerage systems, possibly creating superbugs in the environment.

Those who can muster their brain's own chemical forces against depression, it appears, have a head start in overcoming its symptoms with help from a medication. But those whose brain chemistry doesn't react as much to a fake medicine, or placebo, struggle even after getting an active drug. The findings, published in JAMA Psychiatry and made at the University of Michigan (U-M) Medical School, help explain the variation in treatment response and resiliency that bedevils depression patients and their care teams. The discovery also opens up the door to new research on how to amplify the brain's natural response in new ways -- to improve depression treatment for the estimated 350 million people worldwide who have depression at any given time. The findings could also help those developing and testing new drugs, helping them correct for the placebo effect that gets in the way of measuring a drug's true effect. The study comes from a team that has studied the placebo effect for more than a decade, using sophisticated brain scanning techniques in healthy people. They were pioneers in showing that the brain's natural ""painkiller"" system -- called the mu-opioid system -- responded to pain when patients got a placebo. They've also studied the genetic variation that makes certain people more likely to respond to sham painkillers. For the new study, they studied the brain chemistry of 35 people with untreated major depression, who agreed to try what they thought was a new depression drug, before receiving actual drugs already approved to treat depression. The team found that participants who reported improvement of depression symptoms after getting the placebo also had the strongest mu-opioid response in brain regions involved in emotion and depression. And these individuals were also more likely to experience even fewer symptoms once they got a real drug. In fact, response to placebo predicted nearly half of the variation between individuals in total response to the entire study, including actual drug treatment. ""This is the first objective evidence that the brain's own opioid system involved in response to both antidepressants and placebos, and that variation in this response is associated with variation in symptom relief,"" says the paper's first author Marta Pecina, M.D., Ph.D., a research assistant professor in the U-M Department of Psychiatry and member of the U-M Depression Center. ""This finding gives us a biomarker for treatment response in depression -- an objective way to measure neurochemical compounds involved in response,"" she continues. ""We can envision that by enhancing placebo effects, we might be able to develop faster-acting or better antidepressants."" The research team was led by Jon-Kar Zubieta, M.D., Ph.D., a former U-M faculty member who now chairs the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Utah. He notes that the placebo effect in the study came not only from participants' belief that they were receiving a real drug, but also from the sheer impact of being in a treatment environment. Even as scientists work to understand this effect further, clinicians who treat people with depression may want to take heed of the findings, he notes. ""These results suggest that some people are more responsive to the intention to treat their depression, and may do better if psychotherapies or cognitive therapies that enhance the clinician-patient relationship are incorporated into their care as well as antidepressant medications,"" he says. ""We need to find out how to enhance the natural resiliency that some people appear to have."" Studies testing antidepressants against placebos suggest that 40 percent of response is due to the placebo effect. To drug developers, this is a nuisance. But to placebo researchers, it's like catnip. ""If 40 percent of people recover from a chronic illness without a medication, I want to know why,"" says Zubieta. ""And if you respond to a medication and half your response is due to a placebo effect, we need to know what makes you different from those who don't respond as well."" This could include genetic effects that are still to be discovered. The new findings were made using position emission tomography, or PET, scanning, and a substance that attaches to the receptors on brain cells that mu-opioid molecules bind to. In the single-blind randomized crossover design, the participants went in knowing that they wouldn't be told full details about the purpose of the study until the end. They then received two weeks of placebo pill treatment -- but during one of those weeks, each was told they were taking a substance that is believed to activate internal mechanisms and may have antidepressant properties. At the end of this week, they also came for a brain scan and received an injection of harmless salt water that they were told might have fast-acting antidepressant properties. After these two weeks and scan, they were prescribed a real antidepressant. They reported their depression symptoms using standard measurement scales throughout the study period. The researchers are also studying other molecules in the brain that are involved in depression and treatment response, and are recruiting people for further brain-scanning studies; see umhealth.me/placebodep for more information. In addition to aiding the search for better depression drugs to help placebo non-responders, the new study could help identify which patients might benefit from non-drug strategies known to help people who don't get relief from antidepressant drugs. These include electroconvulsive therapy or ECT, deep-brain stimulation or DBS, and transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS. University of Michigan Health System   press release Zubieta J-K et al.

The results, published in Science Translational Medicine, suggest a link between human endogenous retroviral genes (HERVs) and ALS. The findings also raise the question of whether antiretroviral drugs, similar to those used for suppressing HIV, may help some ALS patients. For generations, humans have been passing on genetic remnants of HERV infections that may have happened millions of years ago. Although nearly eight percent of the normal human genome is made up of these genes, very little is known about their role in health and disease. ""People call the genes for these viruses junk DNA. Our results suggest they may become activated during ALS,"" said Avindra Nath, M.D., clinical director at the NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and a senior author of the study. ""Ultimately we hope the results will lead to effective treatments for a heartbreaking disorder."" Currently, there is no effective treatment for the more than 12,000 Americans who live with ALS. This fatal disorder destroys neurons that control movements, including speaking, walking, breathing and swallowing. On rare occasions, HIV-infected, AIDS patients develop ALS-like symptoms. In many of these patients, the symptoms can be reversed by treatment with antiretroviral drugs. Previous studies found reverse transcriptase, a protein encoded by retroviral genes, in the blood of some ALS patients but its role in the disorder is unknown. These observations prompted Dr. Nath and his team to explore the possible link between retroviruses and ALS. Unexpectedly they found that endogenous, or inherited, retroviruses may be involved with ALS. Initially, they showed that brain samples from ALS patients had higher than normal levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoded by genes of the human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K). A protein encoded by a critical HERV-K gene, called env, was found in brain samples from ALS patients but not from healthy individuals or patients with Alzheimer's disease. They also showed that activation of HERV-K genes killed healthy human neurons grown in petri dishes. To test the role of HERVs in ALS, the scientists genetically modified mice so that their neurons activated the HERV-K env gene. The mice died earlier than normal and had problems with balance and walking that progressively worsened with age. When the scientists inspected the brains, spinal cords and muscles of these mice they found that only motor neurons, the cells that control movements and die in ALS, were damaged. Cells in other parts of the nervous system remained healthy. ""We showed that motor neurons may be susceptible to activation of these genes during ALS,"" said Dr. Nath. Finally the scientists showed that activation of HERV-K genes may be controlled by TDP-43, a gene-regulating protein that has been strongly linked to ALS and known to control HIV production. Genetically enhancing TDP-43 in human neurons increased the cells' production of HERV-K mRNA and proteins whereas genetically blocking TDP-43 in other cells reduced HERV-K reverse transcriptase activity. Dr. Nath and his team are now collaborating with the ALS center at Johns Hopkins University to study whether antiretroviral treatments are effective at controlling HERV-K replication in a subset of patients with ALS.

But the mechanism by which these experimental therapies work has remained unknown. The recent discovery, by a Rockefeller University-led team, of a molecular amplification system helps explain how the drugs alter brain signaling in particular neurons, and so produce an antidepressant effect. The results, published in Molecular Psychiatry, center on a signal receptor known as mGluR5 found on neurons. ""Our experiments suggest that mGluR5 amplifies the cellular response to a chemical signal, and that by blocking mGlur5 receptors in inhibitory neurons involved in depression, these new therapies can achieve an antidepressant effect,"" says senior author Paul Greengard, Vincent Astor Professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience. ""Since mGluR5 is considered a target for treating a variety of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease and Fragile X Syndrome, our research may have implications for therapies for diseases beyond depression."" The path to mGluR5 began with the molecule p11. In 2006, Greengard's lab and their colleagues linked decreased levels of p11, which increases neurons' sensitivity to the chemical message serotonin, to depression. This discovery helped to explain how selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants work and has made it possible to improve upon them. Now the research team, led by first author Ko-Woon Lee, a research associate in the lab, wanted to see if p11 had a similar effect on a different signaling system within the brain. Because it is among the receptors targeted by the new class of antidepressants, they focused on mGluR5, which responds to a number of chemical signals. In the brain, p11 and mGluR5 are both found in cells that produce glutamate as well as those that manufacture a competing signal, GABA. Glutamate signals prompt activity in neurons, while GABA has the opposite effect, tamping it down. Imbalances between the two have been implicated in psychiatric disorders, including depression. After establishing that p11 interacts with mGluR5 and controls signaling by the receptor, the researchers deleted p11 or mGluR5 in both GABA- and glutamate-producing cells. They assessed the effects using behavioral tests, including putting food in the middle of an open space and timing the animals' response. The results showed opposite roles for the molecules in the excitatory versus inhibitory neurons. The loss of mGluR5 or p11 appeared to dampen the GABA neurons' signaling, as shown by the mice's increased willingness to pick up food pellets from an open field -- a proxy measure for resilience from depression and anxiety. Meanwhile deletion of p11 or mGluR5 in glutamate neurons produced mice hesitant to retrieve the food, a sign of a depression-like state. GABA- and glutamate-producing neurons can work in tandem, with a particular class of GABA neurons tamping down excitatory glutamate signaling. This is the secret to the new mGluR5-blocking drugs, the researchers found. In experiments, one such drug inhibited these GABA neurons, thus allowing for an increase in activity among the glutamate neurons, and, as a result, producing an antidepressant effect in the mice. ""This study in combination with prior work shows that the same molecule, p11, mediates the actions of two distinct classes of antidepressants in two totally different types of cells within the brain,"" says co-corresponding author Yong Kim, a research assistant professor in the lab. ""We think that its partner in this case, mGluR5, may also play a role of previously unrecognized breadth, acting within many different types of cells to intensify signals, such as those transmitted by GABA, glutamate, or other neurotransmitters,"" Kim adds. ""This suggests a mechanism by which drugs that target certain other neurological diseases may be effective."" Rockefeller University   press release Greengard P et al.

The experimental drug employed by the NYU Langone team of neuroscientists is called GANT61. It blocks the action of a key protein, Gli1, which is involved in so-called sonic hedgehog signaling, a biological pathway closely tied to neural stem cell development and the growth of some cancers, and whose signaling is raised in tissue samples taken from brain lesions in patients with MS. A report describing the findings is published online in the journal Nature. In the study, mice with chemically damaged brain myelin were given daily doses of GANT61 for one month. Results showed that mice that received the drug had 50 percent more myelin at the end of treatment than did untreated mice. Myelin is the nerve-protecting sheath whose degradation is a principal cause of MS. Moreover, the researchers say, they found that the GANT61-treated mice had an eightfold increase in the number of neural stem cells that migrated to myelin-damaged areas of the brain and eventually developed into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes. Untreated mice did not show this increase. Clinically, the researchers report, drug-treated mice were able to recover from an initial bout of MS-like paralysis and leg weakness. Untreated mice, however, endured repeated bouts of leg and bladder weakness, symptoms similar to those experienced by people with the disorder. According to senior study investigator James Salzer, MD, PhD, the experiments, which took six years to complete, are believed to be the first to demonstrate that neural stem cells, and not just early forms of oligodendrocytic cells, can be modified and recruited into myelin repair. Current treatments that target the immune system mostly slow the disease, which primarily targets myelin in the brain and spinal cord, but clinical experts have not yet been able to repair scarred and degraded myelin. Salzer, a professor at NYU Langone and its Helen and Martin Kimmel Center for Stem Cell Biology and Druckenmiller Neuroscience Institute, says the team's latest findings are also the first to show that drugs targeted at sonic hedgehog, a pathway first discovered in the 1980s, can potentially treat neurological disorders, such as MS. The team's latest research, he says, is also the first strong evidence that in multiple sclerosis, targeting part of the sonic hedgehog pathway has a fundamentally different effect than blocking the entire pathway, which in other experiments elsewhere did not produce any remyelination but instead halted oligodendrocyte maturation. ""Our study results suggest that a potential long-term strategy for treating multiple sclerosis would involve treatments that separately target both neural stem cells, to help turn them into mature oligodendrocytes, as well as young and immature oligodendrocytes to produce more myelin,"" says Salzer. ""Our findings also make clear that there is a resident population of adult neural stem cells that we can target and recruit to treat the disorder,"" says Salzer. Lead study investigator Jayshree Samanta, MBBS, PhD, says the team plans further experiments, with dedicated funding from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, to develop a better Gli1 inhibitor drug, for which Salzer, Samanta, Fishell, and NYU have obtained a patent. Researchers say their latest findings and future projects affirm NYU Langone's commitment to studying the underlying causes and symptoms of MS, as well as developing treatments for the disorder. They also say their fundamental research into MS supports and underscores the integrated model of care employed at NYU Langone's Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center.

No one knew what neuropsin actually did,  says King-Wai Yau, Ph.D., a professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.  We only knew it existed in the mammalian genome and may help set the timing of reproduction for some birds. Now we think we know what it does in mammals.  The new study, described in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, ushers in a more complex view of the retina, according to Zheng Jiang, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow and one of the authors of the paper. Neuropsin is one of seven related  opsin  proteins in mammals. Four enable the rod and cone cells of the retina to absorb light of different wavelengths and transmit that information to the brain so that the eye can see images. Another opsin, melanopsin, also absorbs light but uses it to guide processes like pupil constriction and circadian rhythms. It is found in nerve cells that connect the retina to the body s master clock, the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the brain. On its own, this master clock tends to run slower than 24 hours in humans, and faster than 24 hours in mice, so it needs to be constantly reset to the light/dark environment by signals from the retina. Yau explains that nearly every tissue in the body also has a local molecular  clock  for regulating patterns of activity, but most of them cannot be reset to light on their own. Instead, all but one of these molecular clocks are synchronized by the master clock within the brain   the exception being the retina, which maintains its own rhythms while sending the master clock the signals it needs to set the light-dark activity tempo for the rest of the body. In previous work, Yau s collaborator, Russell van Gelder, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Washington, studied the circadian rhythms of genetically tweaked mice that were missing rod and cone cells and melanopsin. As expected, the circadian rhythms of these mice continued cycling but could no longer adapt to changes in light exposure. Surprisingly, though, the activity patterns of the retinas were still responsive to light changes, suggesting that there was another pigment in play.  The retina is the only tissue known to ignore the master clock, but it does keep itself on a schedule, so we wanted to know how,  says Wendy Yue, a graduate student in Yau s laboratory who worked on the project. Suspecting one of the two opsin proteins with unknown functions, Yau's team created two more types of mice, each one missing one of the opsin genes. The retinas of mice without opsin 3 continued to be light-sensitive but their activity patterns were less robust. However, even with intact rods, cones and melanopsin, the retinas of the mice without neuropsin lost their ability to adapt to new patterns of light and darkness. By repeating their experiments with different wavelengths of light, the team found that neuropsin responds to UV-A and violet light.  That means that the retina uses separate light signals to set its own clock and that of the body s master clock, the latter of which is set based on the blue/green light absorbed by melanopsin as well as blue through red light absorbed by the rods and cones,  says Yau. Next the team used a specialized  locator gene,  called a reporter gene, to figure out where neuropsin does its work. They found that, like melanopsin, it is located in neural cells that connect the retina to the brain, though where these particular cells go within the brain remains uncertain. Mysteriously, the researchers say, they also found it in the cornea, which was not thought to contain any pigments, since its job is to let light through to the rest of the eye.  There is a lot of work left to do,  says Xiaozhi Ren, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Yau s laboratory.  For example, we don t know what kind of signals   chemical or electrical   neuropsin uses to set the retina s clock.  Yau says they also want to investigate what role opsin 3 plays.

Understanding how genomic variants contribute to disease may help clinicians develop improved diagnostics and treatments, in addition to new methods of prevention. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), part of the National Institutes of Health, helped fund and direct this international public-private consortium of researchers in the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Germany and Canada. In two studies investigators examined the genomes of 2,504 people from 26 populations across Africa, East and South Asia, Europe and the Americas. In the main Nature study, investigators identified about 88 million sites in the human genome that vary among people, establishing a database available to researchers as a standard reference for how the genomic make-up of people varies in populations and around the world. The catalog more than doubles the number of known variant sites in the human genome, and can now be used in a wide range of studies of human biology and medicine, providing the basis for a new understanding of how inherited differences in DNA can contribute to disease risk and drug response. Of the more than 88 million variable sites identified, about 12 million had common variants that were likely shared by many of the populations. The study showed that the greatest genomic diversity is in African populations, consistent with evidence that humans originated in Africa and that migrations from Africa established other populations around the world. The 26 populations studied included groups such as the Esan in Nigeria; Colombians in Medellin, Colombia; Iberian populations in Spain; Han Chinese in Beijing; and Sri Lankan Tamil in the United Kingdom. All of the individuals studied for the project consented to broad release of their data, and the data can be used by researchers around the world.  The 1000 Genomes Project was an ambitious, historically significant effort that has produced a valuable resource about human genomic variation,  said Eric Green, M.D., Ph.D., director of NHGRI.  The latest data and insights add to a growing understanding of the patterns of variation in individuals  genomes, and provide a foundation for gaining greater insights into the genomics of human disease.  These reports mark the culmination of the 1000 Genomes Project, which found more than 99 percent of variants in the human genome that occur at a frequency of at least 1 percent in the populations studied.  Some 88 million sites in the genome differ among people. About one-quarter of these variants are common and occur in many or all populations, while about three-quarters occur in only 1 percent of people or are even more rare,  said Lisa Brooks, Ph.D., program director in the NHGRI Genomic Variation Program.  The 1000 Genomes Project data are a resource for any study in which scientists are looking for genomic contributions to disease, including the study of both common and rare variants.  One of the more immediate uses of 1000 Genomes Project data is for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which compare the genomes of people with and without a disease to search for regions of the genome that contain genomic variants associated with that disease. Such studies generally find several genomic regions associated with a disease and many variants in each of those regions. Scientists can now combine GWAS data with the more detailed 1000 Genomes Project data to home in on regions affecting disease more precisely. Instead of sequencing the genomes of all the people in a study, which remains expensive, researchers can use the 1000 Genomes Project data to find most of the variants in those regions that are associated with the disease.  When the 1000 Genomes Project was first launched in 2008, there wasn t much understanding of how rare genomic variants were distributed among populations around the world and their relationship to other variants,  said Adam Auton, Ph.D., the main study senior author and principal investigator who until recently was assistant professor of genetics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.  The project has been an effort to build a reference dataset of genomic variation. It really tells us about the structure of human genomic variation and diversity,  said Dr. Auton, who is now with the company 23andMe in Mountain View, California. In a companion paper in Nature, scientists examined differences in the structure of the genome in the 2,504 samples. They found nearly 69,000 differences, known as structural variants. These genomic differences, many of which affected genes, include deletions (loss of DNA), insertions (added DNA), and duplications (extra DNA copies). The researchers created a map of eight classes of structural variants that potentially contribute to disease.  Structural variation is responsible for a large percentage of differences in the DNA among human genomes,  said Jan Korbel, Ph.D., group leader and European Research Council Investigator in the Genome Biology Unit of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany. Dr. Korbel is senior author and a co-principal investigator for the structural variation study.  No study has ever looked at genomic structural variation with this kind of broad representation of populations around the world.  Dr. Korbel, co-principal investigator Evan Eichler, Ph.D., professor of genome sciences and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the University of Washington in Seattle, and their colleagues discovered that structural variants were often more complicated than they originally thought. For example, the majority of inversions, which involve DNA sequences changing their orientation in the genome, frequently occur along with other structural changes. To Gon alo Abecasis, Ph.D., chair of biostatistics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and co-principal investigator for the main Naturestudy, the value of the 1000 Genomes Project extends far beyond the data. Advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatics were vital to completing the project.  We ve learned a great deal about how to do genomics on a large scale,  said Dr. Abecasis.  Over the course of the 1000 Genomes Project, we developed new, improved methods for large-scale DNA sequencing, analysis and interpretation of genomic information, in addition to how to store this much data. We learned how to do quality genomic studies in different contexts and parts of the world.   The 1000 Genomes Project has laid the foundation for others to answer really interesting questions,  said Dr. Auton.  Everyone now wants to know what these variants tell us about human disease.

The results, published in Science Translational Medicine, suggest a link between human endogenous retroviral genes (HERVs) and ALS. The findings also raise the question of whether antiretroviral drugs, similar to those used for suppressing HIV, may help some ALS patients. For generations, humans have been passing on genetic remnants of HERV infections that may have happened millions of years ago. Although nearly eight percent of the normal human genome is made up of these genes, very little is known about their role in health and disease. ""People call the genes for these viruses junk DNA. Our results suggest they may become activated during ALS,"" said Avindra Nath, M.D., clinical director at the NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and a senior author of the study. ""Ultimately we hope the results will lead to effective treatments for a heartbreaking disorder."" Currently, there is no effective treatment for the more than 12,000 Americans who live with ALS. This fatal disorder destroys neurons that control movements, including speaking, walking, breathing and swallowing. On rare occasions, HIV-infected, AIDS patients develop ALS-like symptoms. In many of these patients, the symptoms can be reversed by treatment with antiretroviral drugs. Previous studies found reverse transcriptase, a protein encoded by retroviral genes, in the blood of some ALS patients but its role in the disorder is unknown. These observations prompted Dr. Nath and his team to explore the possible link between retroviruses and ALS. Unexpectedly they found that endogenous, or inherited, retroviruses may be involved with ALS. Initially, they showed that brain samples from ALS patients had higher than normal levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoded by genes of the human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K). A protein encoded by a critical HERV-K gene, called env, was found in brain samples from ALS patients but not from healthy individuals or patients with Alzheimer's disease. They also showed that activation of HERV-K genes killed healthy human neurons grown in petri dishes. To test the role of HERVs in ALS, the scientists genetically modified mice so that their neurons activated the HERV-K env gene. The mice died earlier than normal and had problems with balance and walking that progressively worsened with age. When the scientists inspected the brains, spinal cords and muscles of these mice they found that only motor neurons, the cells that control movements and die in ALS, were damaged. Cells in other parts of the nervous system remained healthy. ""We showed that motor neurons may be susceptible to activation of these genes during ALS,"" said Dr. Nath. Finally the scientists showed that activation of HERV-K genes may be controlled by TDP-43, a gene-regulating protein that has been strongly linked to ALS and known to control HIV production.

As a leading contract development and manufacturing organization, Vetter is continuously developing its manufacturing sites and techniques to prepare them for future needs and requirements. The upgrades are being driven by a changing healthcare market that is affected by issues such as ever-more complex molecules, smaller batch sizes, and increasing regulatory requirements. The first of the facility expansions are already ongoing at several of the company s German locations including its  Ravensburg Vetter West  center for visual inspection and logistics. Structural work for the facility enlargement, which will offer more than double of its current capacity, is completed with the site being on schedule to become fully operational in 2017. In addition, the Ravensburg Vetter South production site has also been designated for significant enlargements as is the Ravensburg Schuetzenstrasse facility where initial construction activities began in 2013. All three site expansions will result in additional capacities for drug product manufacturing and logistic services. A central technology element of the planned upgrades will be the implementation of an in-house made improved restricted access barrier system (RABS) concept which will contribute to increased operational excellence in aseptic manufacturing. For decades, Vetter has relied on RABS as one of the two distinct technologies available today for its aseptic filling processes, the other being isolators. RABS achieves the sterility assurance level (SAL) required by regulatory authorities, and allows for rapid product change-over coupled with high safety. To better meet future industry trends in quality, safety and flexibility, a corporate project team has evolved this  Improved RABS concept  by combining the advantages of isolator and RABS technology. The core of the approach is a uniquely fast, by today s standards, 3-hour cycle and fully automated decontamination of the cleanroom using hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2), resulting from an extremely high level of process innovation. Following a successful pilot project in a selected cleanroom the company will now implement this decontamination concept in all of its cleanrooms within the next years. All of the planned activities are designed to meet future customer expectations and regulatory requirements at an early stage, maintaining a level of manufacturing excellence that customers have come to expect from Vetter.  We are continuously monitoring and reacting to a changing marketplace and are pleased that we are in the position to be able to make these strategic investments to further develop our sites and meet these challenges. Individually and collectively, they will help us keep pace with the market and allow us to continue to build a successful future for Vetter and our customers,  said Vetter Managing Director Peter Soelkner. Managing Director Thomas Otto added  As trusted partners for drug product development and manufacturing, it is our intent to always get each customer s job done right. In order to reach this level on a continuous basis, these investments are the right step, at the right time. ","Published: October 1, 2015"

But when we think of antibiotic overuse, we don t generally think of allergies. Research is beginning to suggest that maybe we should. Allergies are getting more and more common In the last two to three decades, immunologists and allergists have noted a dramatic increase in the prevalence of allergies. The American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology reports that some 40%-50% of schoolchildren worldwide are sensitized to one or more allergens. The most common of these are skin allergies such as eczema (10%-17%), respiratory allergies such as asthma and rhinitis (~10%), and food allergies such as those to peanuts (~8%). This isn t just happening in the US. Other industrialized countries have seen increases as well. This rise has mirrored the increased use of antibiotics, particularly in children for common viral infections such as colds and sore throats. Recent studies show that they may be connected. Antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiome Why would antibiotics, which we use to fight harmful bacteria, wind up making someone more susceptible to an allergy? While antibiotics fight infections, they also reduce the normal bacteria in our gastrointestinal system, the so-called gut microbiome. Because of the interplay between gut bacteria and the normal equilibrium of cells of the immune system, the gut microbiome plays an important role in the maturation of the immune response. When this interaction between bacteria and immune cells does not happen, the immune system responds inappropriately to innocuous substances such as food or components of dust. This can result in the development of potentially fatal allergies. Exposure to the microbes at an early age is important for full maturation of our immune systems. Reducing those microbes may make us feel cleaner, but our immune systems may suffer. Do more microbes means fewer allergies? Research done in Europe has shown that children who grow up on farms have a wider diversity of microbes in their gut, and have up to 70% reduced prevalence of allergies and asthma compared to children who did not grow up on farms. This is because exposure to such a wide range of microbes allows our immune systems to undergo balanced maturation, thus providing protection against inappropriate immune responses. In our attempts to prevent infections, we may be setting the stage for our children to developing life-threatening allergies and asthma. For instance, a study from 2005 found that infants exposed to antibiotics in the first 4-6 months have a 1.3- to 5-fold higher risk of developing allergy. And infants with reduced bacterial diversity, which can occur with antibiotic use, have increased risk of developing eczema. And it s not the just the antibiotics kids take that can make a difference. It s also the antibiotics their mothers take. The Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood Cohort, a major longitudinal study of infants born to asthmatic mothers in Denmark, reported that children whose mothers took antibiotics during pregnancy were almost twice as likely to develop asthma compared to children whose mothers did not take antibiotics during pregnancy. Finally, in mice studies, offspring of mice treated with antibiotics were shown to have an increased likelihood of developing allergies and asthma. Why are antibiotics overused? Physicians and patients know that overusing antibiotics can cause big problems. It seems that a relatively small number of physicians are driving overprescription of antibiotics. A recent study of physician prescribing practices reported that 10% of physicians prescribed antibiotics to 95% of their patients with upper respiratory tract infections. Health care professionals should not only be concerned about the development of antibiotic resistance, but also the fact that we may be creating another health problem in our patients, and possibly in their children too. Parents should think carefully about asking physicians for antibiotics in an attempt to treat their children s common colds and sore throats (or their own), which are often caused by viral infections that don t respond to them anyway. And doctors should think twice about prescribing antibiotics to treat these illnesses, too. As we develop new antibiotics, we need to address overuse As resistant bacteria become a greater problem, we desperately need to develop new antibiotics. The development process for a new antibiotic takes a considerable amount of time (up to 10 years), and drug companies have previously neglected this area of drug development. Congress has recognized that antibiotic overuse is a major problem and recently passed the 21st Century Cures bill. This bill includes provisions that would create payment incentives from Medicare for hospitals that use new antibiotics. But this approach would have the perverse effect of increasing the use of any new antibiotics in our arsenal without regard for whether bacterial resistance has developed. This would not only exacerbate the problem of resistance, but potentially lead to more people developing allergies. Congress should consider more than just supporting increased development of new antibiotics, but also address the core problem of overuse. This may stave off the further development of antibiotic resistant bacteria and reduce the trend of increasing development of allergies.","Published: October 1, 2015"

The wine samples ranged from 10 to 76 parts per billion, with an average of 24 parts per billion. But a companion study concluded that the likely health risks from that naturally-occurring toxic element depend on how many other foods and beverages known to be high in arsenic, such as apple juice, rice, or cereal bars, an individual person eats. The highest risks from arsenic exposure stem from certain types of infant formulas, the study estimated.  Unless you are a heavy drinker consuming wine with really high concentrations of arsenic, of which there are only a few, there s little health threat if that s the only source of arsenic in your diet,  said Wilson.  But consumers need to look at their diets as a whole. If you are eating a lot of contaminated rice, organic brown rice syrup, seafood, wine, apple juice   all those heavy contributors to arsenic poisoning   you should be concerned, especially pregnant women, kids and the elderly.  Arsenic is a naturally occurring element that is toxic to humans in some forms, and can cause skin, lung and bladder cancers, and other diseases. As rain, rivers or wind erode rocks that contain arsenic, it leaches into water and soil. From there, the toxic metalloid can work its way into the food chain. The UW study is the first peer-reviewed research in decades to look at the arsenic content of American wines. As a group, they had higher arsenic levels than their European counterparts, likely due to the underlying geology of U.S. wine growing regions. The study looked at red wines, except from two areas in Washington where only white wines were produced, because they are made with the skin of grapes where arsenic that is absorbed from soil tends to concentrate. Wilson also tested for lead, which is a common co-contaminant. The study found lead in 58 percent of the samples, but only 5 percent   all from New York   exceeded drinking water standards. Washington wines had the highest arsenic concentrations, averaging 28 parts per billion, while Oregon s had the lowest, averaging 13 parts per billion.  There were no statistical differences among Washington, New York and California,  she said.  The only star in the story is Oregon, where arsenic concentrations were particularly low.  Where possible, the study also compared wines grown in  new  vineyards and those that had been converted from other agricultural uses like orchards, where farmers likely used arsenic-based pesticides that were popular in the early 20th century. It found some evidence that higher levels of arsenic in Washington red wines could be a result of pesticide residue. Because the average adult drinks far more water (between 1.7 and 3.2 cups per day) than even core or frequent wine drinkers (roughly a half cup per day on average), it s an imperfect comparison to gauge health risks based on the EPA drinking water standard of 10 parts per billion. That s why Wilson also evaluated how much arsenic individuals can safely consume from all the sources in their diet.  In a companion study, she compiled consumption data for foods that have been shown to contain arsenic   juice, milk, bottled water, wine, cereal bars, infant formula, rice, salmon and tuna. From that, she was able to determine how much of an arsenic  dose  an average child or adult would get from each food source and how close it would come to risk thresholds set by the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry for total arsenic consumption across a person s diet. For the core or frequent adult wine drinker, the arsenic consumed from that single source would only make up 10 to 12 percent of the total maximum recommended daily arsenic intake. But if that person also eats large quantities of contaminated rice, tuna or energy bars, for instance, that could push that individual s arsenic consumption beyond levels that are considered safe. A person who eats an average or large amount of contaminated rice would get between 41 and 101 percent of the maximum recommended daily dose of arsenic from that one source alone, the study found. A child who drinks apple juice could get a quarter of the maximum daily arsenic dose from that single source. The food that posed the largest risk of arsenic poisoning was infant formula made with organic brown rice syrup, an alternative to high-fructose corn syrup. Wilson estimated that some infants eating large amounts of certain formulas may be getting more than 10 times the daily maximum dose of arsenic. Based on recent studies that have found arsenic in numerous foods and beverages, Wilson recommends that U.S. wineries test for arsenic and lead in irrigation and processing water and take steps to remove those contaminants if levels are found to be high. But rather than litigate against vineyards   as some have done   she would encourage consumers to evaluate their diets more holistically and speak with a doctor if they have concerns. Tests are available that can detect high arsenic levels and tend to capture arsenic exposure over longer histories than other toxic chemicals.  The whole idea that you would sue a winery for having arsenic in their wine is like suing someone for having rocks in their yard,  Wilson said.  My goal is to get people away from asking the question  who do we blame?  and instead offer consumers a better understanding of what they re ingesting and how they can minimize health risks that emerge from their diets.

For this trial, patients are being recruited in two clinical centres in The Netherlands and in Belgium. Cristal Therapeutics has developed a pioneering approach to transform existing drugs against cancer, like docetaxel, and other diseases, into tailor-made nanoparticles via its proprietary polymeric technology, registered as CriPec . The CriPec  platform allows for the rational design of custom-made nanomedicines for controlled release of the drug at the desired site of action resulting in an improved efficacy and tolerability. Lead candidateCriPec  docetaxel is Cristal Therapeutics  lead candidate in development and represents a novel treatment approach of solid tumours. CriPec  docetaxel successfully passed various pre-clinical studies, demonstrating a significantly improved safety and tolerability profile. Current docetaxel-containing products often have limited efficacy, and prolongation of survival comes with a high incidence of adverse events. This imposes major limitations on the current therapy. CriPec  nanoparticles accumulate in tumour tissue, resulting in a significantly higher CriPec  docetaxel exposure of the tumour, thereby overcoming drawbacks of conventional docetaxel therapies. Trial designThe first phase I trial is run by Dr. Ferry Eskens (Erasmus M.C. Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) and Prof. Dr. Patrick Sch ffski (Department of General Medical Oncology, University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium). The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics upon different administered doses will be assessed by monitoring adverse events during the study. This phase I study consists of two parts. In part I the recommended dose will be determined. In part II the efficacy and safety will be evaluated of the recommended dose (as determined in part I). Joost Holthuis, CEO of Cristal Therapeutics says:  We are very excited about the start of the clinical phase I trial. The outcome of our pre-clinical program has been very encouraging and highlights the clinical potential of CriPec  docetaxel. We are looking forward to advance this compound quickly into the phase I- part II trial that is expected to start next year. If successful, this will enable chemotherapy to be applied more effectively, with fewer adverse events, which is in the interest of patients with solid tumours worldwide.  Pipeline growth strategyThe start of this clinical phase I trial in is perfect alignment with Cristal Therapeutics  strategy focused on the further development of candidates in its pipeline. In addition to forwarding its lead candidate, Cristal Therapeutics is also advancing peptide-based product programs (solid tumours), a dexamethasone based product (inflammation) and an antigen nanomedicine based on Cristal Therapeutics  CriVac vaccine technology.","Published: October 1, 2015"

Dr Florian von Groote-Bidlingmaier, director of Task Applied Science, which performs clinical trials in tuberculosis (TB) in Cape Town, South Africa, told the Congress that there was an urgent need to develop new drugs to treat TB and, in particular, drug-resistant TB. But one of the patient populations that was most in need of them, HIV patients, have been excluded from early phase clinical trials of these drugs. This resulted in slower development of new anti-tuberculosis drugs. Dr von Groote-Bidlingmaier and his colleagues reviewed the records of 421 patients with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis who had been referred to Brooklyn Chest Hospital in Cape Town for consideration for participation in clinical drug trials investigating a new anti-TB drug. They found that 105 patients (24.9%) were disqualified as they had HIV with a low level of white blood cells (CD4+ cells) that fight infection or were on anti-retroviral therapy. Of the remaining eligible patients, 29 (6.9%) had died and 72 (17.1%) did not have multi-drug-resistant TB but resistance to rifampicin (an anti-TB drug) alone. Finally, of the 55 patients (13.1%) who did qualify for consideration for inclusion in the trial, only 12 (2.9%) were eventually formally evaluated.  HIV infection with a low CD4 count and anti-retroviral therapy were the number one reasons for non-consideration for inclusion in pivotal clinical trials of a novel anti-tuberculosis drug,  he said.  We need new anti-TB drugs and we need to develop them fast. Drug development is a lengthy and expensive process and should be accelerated as much as possible. It is very, very difficult to recruit suitable patients with multi-drug-resistant TB for trials of new drugs. Inclusion of HIV patients early on would increase the number of participants and the relevance of the results.  He said the lack of effective new anti-TB drugs, especially ones that could be used by HIV patients who take other potent drugs for their HIV infection, was a problem not just for South Africa but also for all countries with a high burden of TB and a high HIV infection rate.  South Africa has one of the highest HIV rates in adults at just under 20% of the population, and HIV patients are more likely to contract TB, which is now the number one cause of death in HIV/AIDS patients. In South Africa, more than 60% of TB patients are HIV infected, and that rate is even higher in drug-resistant TB patients.  HIV patients who have TB are an important group, who are a lot more complicated to treat and a lot more expensive for the health systems. Some TB drugs have drug interactions with anti-retroviral drugs, and so the compatibility of new TB drugs with concomitant anti-retroviral treatment should be investigated early in the clinical development, and HIV patients should be included in relevant clinical trials.  At present, HIV patients tend to be excluded from early phase clinical trials so that any confounding factors can be excluded in these  proof of concept  studies investigating the tolerability and efficacy of new drugs.  This makes sense from the drug development point of view. However, since HIV patients make up more than half of the TB patients, at least in South Africa, investigation of interactions between TB drugs and anti-retroviral drugs should be a priority and done early on,  he said. He believes that early trials that look specifically at drug interactions may be the way forward.  If TB drugs cannot be used with anti-retrovirals, more than 60% of TB patients in South Africa and elsewhere will not be able to be treated with those drugs.  He concluded:  South Africa is one of the few countries where bedaquiline (one of the new TB drugs) is available without cost to the patient. This is a great success and a major breakthrough ten years after the first clinical trial with bedaquiline was done in Cape Town. Close collaboration between research groups and the government healthcare system is key to efficient drug development. The communities participating in these trials will benefit from that type of research directly. ","Published: October 1, 2015"

The work was tested successfully in an animal model.  There are two key advantages to using platelet membranes to coat anticancer drugs,  says Zhen Gu, corresponding author of a paper on the work and an assistant professor in the joint biomedical engineering program at North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  First, the surface of cancer cells has an affinity for platelets   they stick to each other. Second, because the platelets come from the patient s own body, the drug carriers aren t identified as foreign objects, so last longer in the bloodstream.   This combination of features means that the drugs can not only attack the main tumor site, but are more likely to find and attach themselves to tumor cells circulating in the bloodstream   essentially attacking new tumors before they start,  says Quanyin Hu, lead author of the paper and a Ph.D. student in the joint biomedical engineering program.Here s how the process works. Blood is taken from a patient   a lab mouse in the case of this research   and the platelets are collected from that blood. The isolated platelets are treated to extract the platelet membranes, which are then placed in a solution with a nanoscale gel containing the anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox), which attacks the nucleus of a cancer cell. The solution is compressed, forcing the gel through the membranes and creating nanoscale spheres made up of platelet membranes with Dox-gel cores. These spheres are then treated so that their surfaces are coated with the anticancer drug TRAIL, which is most effective at attacking the cell membranes of cancer cells. When released into a patient s bloodstream, these pseudo-platelets can circulate for up to 30 hours   as compared to approximately six hours for the nanoscale vehicles without the coating. When one of the pseudo-platelets comes into contact with a tumor, three things happen more or less at the same time. First, the P-Selectin proteins on the platelet membrane bind to the CD44 proteins on the surface of the cancer cell, locking it into place. Second, the TRAIL on the pseudo-platelet s surface attacks the cancer cell membrane. Third, the nanoscale pseudo-platelet is effectively swallowed by the larger cancer cell. The acidic environment inside the cancer cell then begins to break apart the pseudo-platelet   freeing the Dox to attack the cancer cell s nucleus. In a study using mice, the researchers found that using Dox and TRAIL in the pseudo-platelet drug delivery system was significantly more effective against large tumors and circulating tumor cells than using Dox and TRAIL in a nano-gel delivery system without the platelet membrane.  We d like to do additional pre-clinical testing on this technique,  Gu says.  And we think it could be used to deliver other drugs, such as those targeting cardiovascular disease, in which the platelet membrane could help us target relevant sites in the body.

Once we learned this molecule, named cortistatin A, was very potent and selective in terms of inhibiting the growth of AML [acute myeloid leukemia] cells, we tested it in mouse models of AML and found that it was as efficacious as any other molecule we had seen, without having deleterious effects,  Shair said.  This suggests we have identified a promising new therapeutic approach.  It s one that could be available to test in patients relatively soon.  We synthesized cortistatin A and we are working to develop novel therapeutics based on it by optimizing its drug-like properties,  Shair said.  Given the dearth of effective treatments for AML, we recognize the importance of advancing it toward clinical trials as quickly as possible.  The drug-development process generally takes years, but Shair s lab is very close to having what is known as a development candidate that could be taken into late-stage preclinical development and then clinical trials. An industrial partner will be needed to push the technology along that path and toward regulatory approval. Harvard s Office of Technology Development (OTD) is engaged in advanced discussions to that end. The molecule works, Shair explained, by inhibiting a pair of nearly identical kinases, called CDK8 and CDK19, that his research indicates play a key role in the growth of AML cells. The kinases operate as part of a poorly understood, massive structure in the nucleus of cells called the mediator complex, which acts as a bridge between transcription factors and transcriptional machinery. Inhibiting these two specific kinases, Shair and colleagues found, doesn t shut down all transcription, but instead has gene-specific effects.  We treated AML cells with cortistatin A and measured the effects on gene expression,  Shair said.  One of the first surprises was that it s affecting a very small number of genes   we thought it might be in the thousands, but it s in the low hundreds.  When Shair, Henry Pelish, a senior research associate in chemistry and chemical biology, and then-Ph.D. student Brian Liau looked closely at which genes were affected, they discovered many were associated with DNA regulatory elements known as  super-enhancers.   Humans have about 220 different types of cells in their body   they all have the same genome, but they have to form things like skin and bone and liver cells,  Shair explained.  In all cells, there are a relatively small number of DNA regulatory elements, called super-enhancers. These super-enhancers drive high expression of genes, many of which dictate cellular identity. A big part of cancer is a situation where that identity is lost, and the cells become poorly differentiated and are stuck in an almost stem-cell-like state.  While a few potential cancer treatments have attacked the disease by down-regulating such cellular identity genes, Shair and colleagues were surprised to find that their molecule actually turned up the activity of those genes in AML cells.  Before this paper, the thought was that cancer is ramping these genes up, keeping the cells in a hyper-proliferative state and affecting cell growth in that way,  Shair said.  But our molecule is saying that s one part of the story, and in addition cancer is keeping the dosage of these genes in a narrow range. If it s too low, the cells die. If they are pushed too high, as with cortistatin A, they return to their normal identity and stop growing.  Shair s lab became interested in the molecule several years ago, shortly after it was first isolated and described by other researchers. Early studies suggested it appeared to inhibit just a handful of kinases.  We tested approximately 400 kinases, and found that it inhibits only CDK8 and CDK19 in cells, which makes it among the most selective kinase inhibitors identified to date,  Shair said.  Having compounds that precisely hit a specific target, like cortistatin A, can help reduce side effects and increase efficacy. In a way, it shatters a dogma because we thought it wasn t possible for a molecule to be this selective and bind in a site common to all 500 human kinases, but this molecule does it, and it does it because of its 3-D structure. What s interesting is that most kinase-inhibitor drugs do not have this type of 3-D structure. Nature is telling us that one way to achieve this level of specificity is to make molecules more like cortistatin A.  Shair s team successfully synthesized the molecule, which helped them study how it worked and why it affected the growth of a very specific type of cell. Later on, with funding and drug-development expertise provided by Harvard s Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator, Shair s lab created a range of new molecules that may be better suited to clinical application.  It s a complex process to make [cortistatin A]   32 chemical steps,  said Shair.  But we have been able to find less complex structures that act just like the natural compound, with better drug-like properties, and they can be made on a large scale and in about half as many steps.   Over the course of several years, we have watched this research progress from an intriguing discovery to a highly promising development candidate,  said Isaac Kohlberg, senior associate provost and chief technology development officer.  The latest results are a real testament to Matt s ingenuity and dedication to addressing a very tough disease.  While there is still much work to be done   in particular, to better understand how CDK8 and CDK19 regulate gene expression   the early results have been dramatic.  This is the kind of thing you do science for,  Shair said,  the idea that once every 10 or 20 years you might find something this interesting, that sheds new light on important, difficult problems. This gives us an opportunity to generate a new understanding of cancer and also develop new therapeutics to treat it. We re very excited and curious to see where it goes.

That s because current tests aren t sensitive enough to detect low levels of viral bugs or are limited to detecting only those viruses suspected of being responsible for a patient s illness.  With this test, you don t have to know what you re looking for,  said the study s senior author, Gregory Storch, MD, the Ruth L. Siteman Professor of Pediatrics.  It casts a broad net and can efficiently detect viruses that are present at very low levels. We think the test will be especially useful in situations where a diagnosis remains elusive after standard testing or in situations in which the cause of a disease outbreak is unknown.  Results published recently demonstrate that in patient samples the new test   called ViroCap   can detect viruses not found by standard testing based on genome sequencing. The test could be used to detect outbreaks of deadly viruses such as Ebola, Marburg and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), as well as more routine viruses, including rotavirus and norovirus, both of which cause severe gastrointestinal infections.Developed in collaboration with the university s McDonnell Genome Institute, the test sequences and detects viruses in patient samples and is just as sensitive as the gold-standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, which are used widely in clinical laboratories. However, even the most expansive PCR assays can only screen for up to about 20 similar viruses at the same time. The Washington University researchers are making the technology they developed publicly available to scientists and clinicians worldwide, for the benefit of patients and research. The researchers evaluated the new test in two sets of biological samples   for example, from blood, stool and nasal secretions   from patients at St. Louis Children s Hospital. In the first, standard testing that relied on genome sequencing had detected viruses in 10 of 14 patients. But the new test found viruses in the four children that earlier testing had missed. Standard testing failed to detect common, everyday viruses: influenza B, a cause of seasonal flu; parechovirus, a mild gastrointestinal and respiratory virus; herpes virus 1, responsible for cold sores in the mouth; and varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox. In a second group of children with unexplained fevers, standard testing had detected 11 viruses in the eight children evaluated. But the new test found another seven, including a respiratory virus called human adenovirus B type 3A, which usually is harmless but can cause severe infections in some patients. In all, the number of viruses detected in the two patient groups jumped to 32 from 21, a 52 percent increase.  The test is so sensitive that it also detects variant strains of viruses that are closely related genetically,  said corresponding author Todd Wylie, an instructor of pediatrics.  Slight genetic variations among viruses often can t be distinguished by currently available tests and complicate physicians  ability to detect all variants with one test.  In addition, because the test includes detailed genetic information about various strains of particular viruses, subtypes can be identified easily. For example, the study showed that while standard testing identified a virus as influenza A, which causes seasonal flu, the new test indicated that the virus was a particularly harsh subtype called H3N2. Last flu season, H3N2 contributed to some 36,000 deaths in the United States. And in some patients   particularly young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems   knowing that the H3N2 strain is present may alter treatment. To develop the test, the researchers targeted unique stretches of DNA or RNA from every known group of viruses that infects humans and animals. In all, the research team included 2 million unique stretches of genetic material from viruses in the test. These stretches of material are used as probes to pluck out viruses in patient samples that are a genetic match. The matched viral material then is analyzed using high-throughput genetic sequencing. As completely novel viruses are discovered, their genetic material could easily be added to the test, Storch said. The researchers plan to conduct additional research to validate the accuracy of the test, so it could be several years before it is clinically available.  It also may be possible to modify the test so that it could be used to detect pathogens other than viruses, including bacteria, fungi and other microbes, as well as genes that would indicate the pathogen is resistant to treatment with antibiotics or other drugs,  said co-author Kristine Wylie, PhD, assistant professor of pediatrics. In the meantime, the technology can be used by scientists to study viruses in a research setting. Kristine Wylie investigates the viruses that set up residence in and on the human body, collectively known as the virome. The new test will provide a way to capture the full breadth and depth of such viruses, and deepen understanding of how they play a role in keeping the body healthy. ","Published: October 1, 2015"

The researchers have developed a small array of flexible sensors, which accurately detect compounds in breath samples that are specific to ovarian cancer. Diagnosing cancer today usually involves various imaging techniques, examining tissue samples under a microscope, or testing cells for proteins or genetic material. In search of safer and less invasive ways to tell if someone has cancer, scientists have recently started analyzing breath and defining specific profiles of compounds in breath samples. But translating these exhaled disease fingerprints into a meaningful diagnosis has required a large number of sensors, which makes them impractical for clinical use. Hossam Haick and colleagues sought to address this problem.The researchers developed a small, breath-diagnostic array based on flexible gold-nanoparticle sensors for use in an  electronic nose.  The system   tested on breath samples from 43 volunteers, 17 of whom had ovarian cancer   showed an accuracy rate of 82 percent. The researchers say developing this method further would require larger-scale clinical testing. They add that the approach could also apply to diagnostics for other diseases.","Published: October 1, 2015"

The work by biochemists Jianpeng Ma and Qinghua Wang and their colleagues appears this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Ma holds a joint appointment at Rice and Baylor; Wang is at Baylor. Proteins are large molecular chains of amino acids that perform many duties in the body. Knowing how the chains fold into functional proteins helps researchers determine how those involved in causing a disease might be addressed with drugs.Obtaining actin s structural details in atom-scale resolution had stumped many scientists, Ma said, because the protein s rapid growth into an actin filament made it too long to be crystallized. The Rice-Baylor effort came into focus 10 years ago when Ma realized that mutations can be designed to limit actin filament growth. Complexes with only two to four actin subunits would be short enough to be crystallized. The researchers first solved actin s long-standing resistance to analysis by making minor mutations that did not affect the actin subunits  ability to form small molecular complexes called oligomers, but allowed it to be frozen in place and captured by X-ray crystallography, a century-old technique that reveals the position of every atom in a molecule. (Proteins are in constant motion as they carry out their functions. Researchers can study their three-dimensional forms only when they lock their atoms into position by crystallizing them.) Ma and Wang were then most interested in the structure of Lmod2, a protein that nucleates actin and then mediates the formation of actin filaments within muscle cells. Bundles of filaments form fiber-like scaffolds that allow the elongated cells to expand and contract. Lmod2 is one of a family of proteins central to actin functions in many types of muscle cells, including cardiac and skeletal muscles.  This protein is critical to biogenesis and length maintenance of actin filaments,  Wang said.  The filaments cannot be too short or too long.  When Wang and Baylor postdoctoral researcher Xiaorui Chen mapped a mutation from another member of the leiomodin family known as Lmod3 observed in multiple patients onto Lmod2 in the lab, the resultant mutant lost its ability to nucleate actin filaments. That, Wang said, explains why the mutation can be lethal to patients.  It has been a long and difficult process,  Chen said.  I am glad we persisted and succeeded.  The work opens a window for researchers to treat nemaline myopathy by addressing the mutations, as well as a way to view mechanisms in other members of the leiomodin family.  This is just one example,  Wang said.  Because this protein has a large family, this structure not only helps us understand how this molecule works, it also helps understand how the family of this type of molecule works.  In the process, Ma said, the team realized actin nucleators may also serve as an important component of signaling pathways in mammals that mediates the production of actin by acting as an  elegant  sensing mechanism. This possibility will be the subject of future study, he said.","Published: October 1, 2015"

Three World-renowned experts - Bikash Chatterjee, President and CSO, Pharmatech Associates; Emil Ciurczak, President at Doramaxx; and Brian Carlin, Director Open Innovation at FMC - look at the implications of QbD, continuous processing, excipient criticality, and process validation on pharma manufacturing. The overall findings reveal there is clearly now a global commitment to move forward with the principles of QbD, however, the rate of adoption remains highly uneven. At the advanced end of the spectrum there are a limited number of Western manufacturers that are moving towards continuous processing. However, underestimating the complexity of both raw materials and finished products will continue to breed Black Swans, which could be particularly detrimental to continuous manufacture with real time release. Emil Ciurczak believes that within 10-years all manufacturing globally will be continuous and it is only inertia and the fact that big pharma can still largely charge what they want in the USA that is preventing faster implementation - he warns that those manufacturers that fail to implement change early enough won t see out the decade. The rate of adoption is now accelerating and he states we will see the industry s leaders producing one or two products per year pace for the next several years, before only submitting NDA s that include Continuous Manufacturing. He argues it will be at this point that we will see the biggest game changer however, as the largest generics companies (Teva and Sandox perhaps) start purchasing equipment. Following in their lead, the remainder of the market will quickly start investing. Overall, this could bring the cost of drug manufacturing down by as much as 50% if started at the development stage. He concludes that generic and orphan drug companies will see the greatest benefits. Bikash Chatterjee outlined that, in particular, the gradual integration of QbD principles is going to be transformational over the next few years as companies strive to implement guidelines from the EMA and FDA. In Europe and the US, Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (CDMOs) whose business model is geared toward partnering with virtual drug development companies are likely to be the first to embrace the core tenets of QbD. However, contract manufacturers may lag a little in implementation, as they are not forced to embed these processes with new drugs. Now that EMA and FDA guidelines are synergizing, PIC/S rollout to 55 countries by 2023 will be transformational in terms of global adoption. In emerging markets, larger drug manufacturers with margin to build in these systems will be first to move across and will benefit from sales into the USA and Europe. For the remainder, we will see an uneven implementation similar to that of GMP in China over the last decade. Both Emil and Brian Carlin feel the situation with regards to excipients is more complicated, Emil states that continuous processing will not be a factor here and Brian warns of the residual risk from excipient complexity even when using QbD principles. For finished product quality it is the multivariate balance of properties, not just each property separately, that must be controlled. Excipient variability must be addressed. Paradoxically, with fixed formulae and processes, the risk from raw material increases if there are no compensatory mechanisms to stop variability feeding forward. Without joint due-diligence from users and suppliers pharmaceutical  black swans  will continue to impact products. The experts agreed that global harmonization, greater raw material understanding, QbD and continuous processing trends will continue. Emil argues in the longer term, this will lead to remarkable innovations such as variable dosage forms when combined with 3D printing. Additionally, the unique  process signature  of a single production stream will also help identify counterfeits and tighten the Supply Chain further   lowering cost, individualizing patient dosage forms and improving safety. Chris Kilbee, Group Director Pharma at CPhI:  Regulation, metrics and quality controls across the pharma industry are evolving, and over the next few years, our experts show that we will be working towards harmonization, improved standards, and in continuous processing, some fairly revolutionary manufacturing techniques. At CPhI Worldwide, we want to make sure we are central to the debate around how pharma is changing and we encourage our experts to use this forum to drive the industry forward. The annual meeting is now a place to not only do business, but also debate how we can partner and improve. By implementing the recommendations from our panel, the pharma industry will advance more quickly, develop better and safer drugs and usher in a new age of lower cost and modernized manufacturing.

It turns out that cells in our brains can be equally moody, changing the tune of their electrical signals from time to time. In a new study, Mohini Sengupta and Vatsala Thirumalai, from the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bangalore, demonstrate that nerve cells found at the base of the brain in the cerebellum send out electrical signals in either a constant hum or in sudden bursts. Which of the two tunes they choose depends on the voltage across their cell membranes and on inputs from a specific region of the brain under certain conditions. The cerebellum, a small leaf-like structure at the base of our brain, is important for controlling balance, coordination and for learning new motor skills such as riding a bicycle or playing a piano. Purkinje cells are arranged neatly in a single layer within the cerebellum and are essential in carrying out the aforementioned functions. Purkinje cells receive signals from many different regions of the brain and then send out messages to the deeper layers of the cerebellum. How Purkinje cells communicate with other nerve cells, has thus far been a mystery, mainly because it is difficult to 'listen' to these cells in animals that are awake and moving around. These nerve cells are very small and scientists employ very fine instruments to record their electrical signals in experiments that require animals to be anesthetised, as even small movements can knock the equipment out of place. Unfortunately, the anaesthetics themselves can alter the electrical signals generated by the brain. Therefore, previous studies on the signals generated by Purkinje cells in awake and moving animals have been inconclusive. The team at NCBS circumvented these issues by carrying out their research on the zebrafish whose young are transparent with an undeveloped skull. Furthermore, specific nerve cells in these fish can be made to glow by injecting DNA into them. This made it possible for the scientists to insert and precisely place fine recording equipment onto the Purkinje cells within the fish brains. To prevent the fish from moving, a paralytic agent that does not interfere with electrical signals in the brain was used. This combination of techniques allowed researchers to record electrical signals from Purkinje cells in an animal that was not anesthetized. Results from these experiments at NCBS showed that Purkinje cells send out electrical signals in two different modes depending on the voltage at their cell surfaces. The first mode, called the 'down' state, occurred when the inside of the cell was more negative compared to the outside. In this state, cells were silent until signals from a different part of the brain arrived, at which time, they sent out a burst of impulses. In the second mode, called the 'up' state, the inside of the cell was less negative compared to the outside and Purkinje cells sent out impulses at a constant rate. In this mode, these cells ignored any impulses coming from other parts of the brain. These states are reminiscent of a person attentively listening to directions and responding accordingly, or simply 'zoning out' and going their own way irrespective of instructions. What does this phenomenon mean for the functioning of the cerebellum? To understand this, the scientists at NCBS recorded the instructions sent out by the nervous system to muscles. Their results indicate that Purkinje cells receive a copy of the instructions sent to muscles and that they generate a burst of impulses in response. The researchers propose that the existence of the 'up' and 'down' states could be a mechanism by which Purkinje cells 'choose' to listen in on such instructions or not. What do these cells do with the instruction copy? Do they alter their signals when the animal is learning new motor tasks? The authors are excited to find out answers to these questions in ongoing experiments. Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Sengupta M, Thirumalai V.

Mutations in specific amino acids can cause long strands of proteins to curl in on themselves and refuse to break apart. These strands, known as amyloid fibrils, can be extremely toxic and are usually harmful. They attach to organs like the brain and pancreas, preventing them from functioning as they should and are responsible for diseases as seemingly different as diabetes and Alzheimer s, to name just a couple. Developing effective medications to treat these diseases, and cause the fibrils to dissolve typically involves biochemists in a lengthy and expensive process of trial and error. But now McGill University researchers in Montreal, Canada, led by Prof. J r me Waldisp hl of the School of Computer Science, have created a suite of computer programs that should speed up the process of drug discovery for diseases of this kind. The programs are designed to scan the fibrils looking for weak spots. The idea is to then design helpful genetic mutations to dissolve the bonds that hold the fibrils together - a bit like finding the right strand of wool to tug on to unravel a whole knotted ball. It s potentially a gargantuan task, because looking for the mutations that will prove useful in drug development involves exploring millions of possible structural combinations of genetic material. But for the Fibrilizer, as McGill has dubbed its suite of computer tools, a name that hints at the super heroic nature of the programs they have developed, the task is of a very different order.  Within the space of a week, by using our programs and a supercomputer, we were able to look at billions of possible ways to weaken the bonds within these toxic protein strands. We narrowed it down to just 30 - 50 possibilities that can now be explored further,  says Mohamed Smaoui, a McGill postdoctoral fellow and the first author on three recent papers on the research.  Typically biochemists can spend months or years in the lab trying to pinpoint these promising mutations.  The researchers tested their program on a medical compound that scientists have been trying to improve for the last couple decades. The compound is administered as part of a drug that is used by diabetes patients to boost the performance of insulin and is sold under the name Symlin. The synthetic compound is based on a version of the protein amylin, yet is known to be toxic to the pancreas over the long-term, creating amyloid fibrils. The McGill team were able to use Fibrilizer to pinpoint a limited number of possible genetic modifications to the compound that would act to reduce its toxicity. J r me Waldisp hl, the lead researcher on the papers, believes that computational research of this kind will play an increasingly important role in drug discovery in the future.  Computers are transforming the way that drugs are being developed,  says Waldisp hl.  Amyloid research has accelerated in the last 10 years. But it may prove to be the key to finding better medications for a whole range of systemic and neurodegenerative diseases, from arthritis to Parkinson s. Without supercomputers and programs of this kind, this research would be much more time-consuming and expensive.  McGill University   press release Smaoui MR, Ortand H, Waldisp hl1 J.

Researchers found that pregnant women who received the drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in their third trimester gave birth to babies whose bone mineral content was 12 percent lower than that of infants who were not exposed to the drug in the uterus. Proper mineral content helps strengthen normal bones.   At this point, we can say that those who care for pregnant women with HIV and their children should be aware that prescribing tenofovir to pregnant women could be a concern for their infants  bones,  said George K. Siberry, M.D., the first author of the study and medical officer with NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). Although the study authors described the results as concerning, they cautioned against any changes in the use of tenofovir in pregnant women. The drug has proved successful as part of drug regimens that treat HIV in pregnant women, and often is used to prevent HIV transmission to infants. The researchers called for additional studies to understand bone health and development among children born to women who took tenofovir during their pregnancies.  Families should keep in close touch with their physicians to monitor their child s bone development,  Dr. Siberry added. In the study, researchers enrolled a total of 143 infants at 14 sites across the United States from 2011 to 2013. Of these participants, 74 were exposed to tenofovir in the uterus, while 69 were given other anti-HIV drugs. Researchers used special, low-radiation X-ray scans, called DXA scans to measure bone mineral content within the first four weeks of birth. The researchers then compared the bone mineral content of the two groups and found that the group of infants whose mothers took tenofovir, on average, had lower bone mineral content than the group of infants whose mothers were given other kinds of anti-HIV drugs. However, the researchers do not know whether the lower bone mineral content of the children in the tenofovir group is abnormal and will increase the risk of fractures. Dr. Siberry added that it is also unknown whether children can regain bone mineral content as they get older. The study authors point out that tenofovir use has been associated with bone loss in adults and older children. A few NIH-funded studies have found that adults who used tenofovir were at increased risk for bone fracture.","Published: September 30, 2015"

Many subtypes of influenza A viruses are circulating in people, domestic animals and wild birds throughout the world. In recent years, increasing numbers of influenza A virus subtypes have been found in humans, sometimes with fatal results. ""The world is starting to realize that if you only target certain viruses for testing, you'll miss the new ones that may be circulating,"" said corresponding author Tracey Goldstein, director of the UC Davis One Health Institute Laboratory. The One Health Institute leads USAID's PREDICT program, a global project with the goal to rapidly detect and respond to emerging viruses that move among people, wildlife and livestock. For this study the PREDICT team examined the current available data on influenza A viruses to understand where they are emerging and mutating, with the goal of better directing surveillance efforts. Looking for the overlooked Rather than focusing on a particular subtype and risk overlooking important emerging types, the scientists analyzed all available subtypes to help prioritize which ones should be examined more closely. For example, many labs around the world are conducting targeted testing for H1N1 because it caused a pandemic in 2009, or H5N1, an avian flu, because it has serious implications for poultry worldwide, the authors said. But when H7N9, another avian influenza strain, emerged, it caught scientists off guard. ""If we look more broadly to detect all influenza, we'd have a better handle on what might be coming next,"" Goldstein said. More data please The scientists evaluated 14 high priority subtypes of the virus in 32 countries over a 12-year period. While they were able to see a distinctly higher likelihood of new subtypes of influenza A emerging in East Asia than in North America or Europe, underreporting in other countries meant there was not enough data to understand the larger global picture. ""A lot of countries probably have some, if not all, of these subtypes, but we just don't have the data to know,"" said lead author Daniel Rejmanek, a postdoctoral fellow with the One Health Institute.

Modern structural biology relies on techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy to discover the tiny structural details of biomolecules. All these methods, however, require averaging over a large number of molecules and thus structural details of an individual biomolecule are often lost. Now researchers from the University of Zurich, Switzerland have made a breakthrough by obtaining the first nanometer (one billionth of a meter) resolved image of individual tobacco mosaic virions, a rod-shaped RNA virus that infects a wide range of plants, especially tobacco. The work demonstrates the potential of low-energy electron holography as a non-destructive, single-particle imaging technique for structural biology.  ""We've shown that by means of low-energy holography, it is possible to image individual tobacco mosaic virions deposited on ultraclean freestanding graphene,"" said Jean-Nicolas Longchamp, the primary author and a postdoctoral fellow of the Physics Department at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. ""The virions are imaged with one nanometer resolution exhibiting details of the helical structure of the virus. Our technique would be the first non-destructive imaging tool for structural biology at the truly single molecule level.""Longchamp noted the technique would also open the door for ""rational drug design,"" an inventive process of finding new medications based on the knowledge of a biological target. In the most basic sense, drug design searches for and chemically refines molecules that have some complementarity in shape and charge to some part of another molecule -- such as the binding site of a human protein involved in some physiological process that goes awry in a given disease. Better knowledge about the individual structures of those target proteins can help scientists develop more effective drugs. Low-energy electron holography is a technique of using an electron wave to form holograms. Similar to light optical holography, albeit with a much smaller wavelength, the complete information of the scattered wave, such as phase and amplitude, is recorded thus enabling an unambiguous reconstruction of the object's structure. ""The low-energy electron holography has two major advantages over conventional microscopy. First, the technique doesn't employ any lenses, so the resolution won't be limited by lens aberration. Second, low-energy electrons are harmless to biomolecules,"" Longchamp said. In many conventional techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, the possible resolution is limited by high-energy electrons' radiation damage to biological samples. Individual biomolecules are destroyed long before an image of high enough quality can be acquired. In other words, the low permissible electron dose in conventional microscopies is not sufficient to obtain high-resolution images from a single biomolecule. However, in low-energy electron holography, the employed electron doses can be much higher -- even after exposing fragile molecules like DNA or proteins to a electron dose more than five orders of magnitude higher than the critical dose in transmission electron microscopy, no radiation damage could be observed. Sufficient electron dose in low-energy electron holography makes imaging individual biomolecules at a nanometer resolution possible. In Longchamp's experiment, the tobacco mosaic virions were deposited on a freestanding, ultraclean graphene, an atomically thin layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice. The graphene substrate is similar to a glass slide in optical microscopy, which is conductive, robust and transparent for low-energy electrons. To obtain the high-resolution hologram, an atomically sharp, tungsten tip acts as a source of a divergent beam of highly coherent electrons. When the beam hits the sample, part of the beam is scattered and the other part is not affected. Using a distant detector on the other side of the sample, the researchers recorded the sample's high-resolution hologram, a pattern resulting from the interference of the two beams. ""This is the first time to directly observe the helical structure of the unstained tobacco mosaic virus at a single-particle level,"" Longchamp said. ""Since low-energy electron holography is a method very sensitive to mechanical disturbance, the current nanometer resolution could be improved to angstrom (one ten billionth of a meter) or atomic resolution in the near future by improving the mechanical stability of the microscope."" While by now single proteins have been imaged with nanometer resolution using the same technique, the researchers' next step is to image a single protein at atomic resolution -- something that has never been done before.","Published: September 30, 2015"

This tool should provide fast and reliable characterization of the different mechanisms cellular proteins use to bind to DNA strands   information that could shed new light on the atomic-scale interactions within our cells and help design new drug therapies against pathogens by targeting enzymes that interact with DNA.  There are other single-molecule tools around, but our new tool is far more sensitive,  said senior author and UW physics Professor Jens Gundlach.  We can really pick up atomic-scale movements that a protein imparts onto DNA.  As can happen in the scientific process, they developed this tool   the single-molecule picometer-resolution nanopore tweezers, or SPRNT   while working on a related project.The UW team has been exploring nanopore technology to read DNA sequences quickly. Our genes are long stretches of DNA molecules, which are made up of combinations of four chemical DNA  letters.  In their approach, Gundlach and his team measure an electrical current through a biological pore called MspA, which is embedded within a modified cell membrane. As DNA passes through a tiny opening in the pore   an opening that is just 0.00000012 centimeters wide, or 1/10,000th the width of a human hair   the current shifts based on the sequence of DNA letters. They use these changes in current to infer DNA sequences. Gundlach and his team, in the process of investigating nanopore sequencing, tried out a variety of molecular motors to move DNA through the pore. They discovered that their experimental setup was sensitive enough to observe motions much smaller than the distance between adjacent letters on the DNA. As they report in their paper, SPRNT is more than seven times more sensitive than existing techniques to measure interactions between DNA and proteins.  Generally, most existing techniques to look at single-molecule movements   such as optical tweezers   have a resolution, at best, of about 300 picometers,  said Gundlach.  With SPRNT, we can have 40 picometer resolution.  For reference, 40 picometers are 0.000000004 centimeters, or about 0.0000000016 inches.  We realized we can detect minute differences in the position of the DNA in the pore,  said UW physics postdoctoral researcher Andrew Laszlo, a co-author on the paper.  We could pick up differences in how the proteins were binding to DNA and moving it through the pore.  These differences account for the unique role each cellular protein plays as it interacts with DNA. Cells have proteins to copy DNA,  read  DNA to express genes and repair DNA when it is damaged. There are cellular proteins that unwind DNA, while others bunch DNA tightly together. Biologists have long recognized that proteins have different structures to perform these roles, but the physical motion of proteins as they work on DNA has been difficult to detect directly.  When you have the kind of resolution that SPRNT offers, you can start to pick apart the minute steps these proteins take,  said Laszlo. Gundlach and his team show that SPRNT is sensitive enough to differentiate between the mechanisms that two cellular proteins use to pass DNA through the nanopore opening. One protein, which normally copies DNA, moves along the DNA one letter at a time as it guides DNA through the pore. The second protein, which normally unwinds DNA, instead takes two steps along each DNA letter, which they could pick up by tracking minute changes in the current, according to co-author and UW physics doctoral student Jonathan Craig. They even discovered that these two steps involve sequential chemical processes that the protein uses to walk along DNA.  You can really see the underlying mechanisms, and that has a ton of implications   from understanding how life works to drug design,  said Laszlo. Gundlach believes this tool may open a new window for understanding how cellular proteins process DNA, which could help genetically engineer proteins to perform novel jobs. These fine details may also help scientists understand how mutations in proteins can lead to disease or find protein properties that would be ideal targets for drug therapies.  For example, viral genes code for their own proteins that process their DNA,  said Gundlach.  If we can use SPRNT to screen for drugs that specifically disrupt the functioning of these proteins, it may be possible to interfere with viruses. ","Published: September 30, 2015"

To clear an infection, the immune system must recognize and destroy these vacuoles while leaving the rest of the living cell intact.  The finding could lead to new therapeutic strategies to boost the immune system's response to the pathogens responsible for a long list of human ailments, including tuberculosis, salmonella, chlamydia, toxoplasmosis and malaria.  ""To get rid of these pathogens, the immune system essentially has to find a needle in a haystack,"" said J rn Coers, Ph.D., senior author of the study and assistant professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at Duke University School of Medicine. ""It has to target a single microbe, in a vacuole, in an ocean of other membranes, floating around inside the cell. We found that the immune system accomplishes this feat by painting the vacuole with a coat of ubiquitin, which allows for the recruitment of all these other factors that viciously attack the vacuole and eliminate the pathogen inside.""  When pathogens first enter a host cell, they take part of the plasma membrane with them, wrapping it around themselves like a cloak to mask their true identity. Eventually, a healthy immune system discovers the invasion and puts special molecules called guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) on high alert. These proteins specifically bind to the membranes of the pathogen-containing vacuoles and eliminate the infiltrators. Coers and his colleagues wanted to figure out how the GBPs know which membrane-bound structures to go after.  The researchers first conducted a large-scale screen for proteins involved in the clearance of pathogens. To their surprise, their search turned up a few proteins that play a role in ubiquitination, the process whereby the body s own doomed proteins are marked for destruction with the addition of ubiquitin tags. No previous studies had ever drawn a connection between ubiquitin and the destruction and elimination of pathogen-containing vacuoles by GBPs.  Coers and his colleagues decided to look for these ubiquitin tags on vacuoles containing two different microorganisms: Chlamydia trachomatis, the causative agent of the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection, and Toxoplasma gondii, the single-celled parasite that causes toxoplasmosis.  First, they ""primed"" the cells with cytokines, the signaling molecules that kick the immune system into action. Then, they stained the cells with a red dye that was specific for the ubiquitin protein.  ""All of a sudden we saw these beautiful rings of ubiquitin that nicely decorated the outsides of the pathogen-containing vacuoles,"" said Coers. He and his colleagues went on to identify the molecular players responsible both for attaching the ubiquitin tags and for escorting the GBPs to the surface of the vacuole so they can coordinate an attack.  The researchers also showed that highly virulent strains of Chlamydia and Toxoplasma contain special factors that block the addition of these ubiquitin tags. Because their vacuoles don t get ubiquitinated, the GBPs fail to recognize them as the enemy. In the future, the researchers would like to determine what other tricks pathogens use to evade the immune response. Once they have a clear idea of what makes some of these pathogens more dangerous, they can design therapeutics to render these hypervirulent strains more susceptible to the host response.

Work by Lucas Pontel and Ivan Rosado in KJ Patel s group, in the LMB s PNAC Division, uncovers a fundamental mechanism used by mammals to protect against endogenous formaldehyde, and they also reveal the striking longstanding damage caused when this protection fails. Endogenous formaldehyde is produced by numerous biochemical pathways fundamental to life but it can also crosslink both DNA and proteins, however the consequences of its accumulation were until now unclear. KJ s group shows that endogenous formaldehyde is usually removed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (Adh5). Collaborative work with James Swenberg s group, of the Gillings School of Public Health, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, showed that when endogenous formaldehyde is not removed it damages DNA. This DNA damage is repaired by the Fanconi system of DNA repair that has previously been shown by KJ s group to correct damage caused by acetaldehyde, a known breakdown product of alcohol. This provides a two-tier protection mechanism (the formaldehyde removing enzyme   Adh5 and the Fanconi Anaemia repair factor   Fancd2). Using mice as a model organism, the group found that mice that lacked both the Adh5 and also Fancd2, rapidly died after birth because they could no longer produce blood. This was because endogenous formaldehyde destroyed the blood stem cells residing in the bone marrow. In addition, severe DNA damage also caused the cells of the liver and the kidney to fail. Bone marrow transplantation with normal mouse bone marrow prolonged the life of these genetically altered formaldehyde unprotected mice. This was due to the rescue of their damaged bone marrow, however ensuing formaldehyde damage led to the development of fatal cancers. This study reveals that naturally produced formaldehyde is a common source of endogenous DNA damage that can cause important organ systems to fail, and also drive changes that cause cancer. This new knowledge has implications for human health: children effected by the cancer and bone marrow failure syndrome Fanconi anaemia are unable to repair the DNA damage caused by formaldehyde. In these patients reducing or counteracting endogenous formaldehyde production may be of therapeutic value. Furthermore, this discovery settles a long standing controversy on formaldehyde as an industrial and environmental carcinogen, for it is not exposure to this ubiquitous toxin that causes damage but that which is produced naturally within our bodies that is damaging.","Published: September 30, 2015"

Yang, 44, the S.K. and Angela Chan Distinguished Professor of Energy in the Department of Chemistry and a faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, first achieved notice about 15 years ago when he was the first to build semiconductor nanowires and turn them into tiny lasers smaller than a human hair. Photonic nanowires have potential application in compact communication devices and computers, as well as in efficient solar cells that convert sunlight into electricity. He is currently involved in a large effort to develop a synthetic leaf that uses the principles of photosynthesis, whereby green plants capture light to turn carbon dioxide and water into sugars, to instead make useful chemicals, including fuels such as butane and methane. On the one hand, this award is recognition of our past 16 years of efforts in the semiconductor nanowire field, but it s also a big encouragement and more freedom to pursue the solar-to-chemical conversion project,  said Yang, who is one of the leaders of the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, an  energy innovation hub  launched in 2010 by the Department of Energy, and a member of the Kavli Energy Nanosciences Institute. In April, he and his colleagues succeeded in creating a hybrid system of semiconducting nanowires and bacteria that combined carbon dioxide and water to make acetate, using light as the energy source. Acetate is a starting point for synthesizing chemicals such as biodegradable plastics and pharmaceutical drugs. In August, they used the same system to make methane, the major component of natural gas and a challenge to produce in other ways.  This is the first time anyone has really put together a functional system that can do the job of a synthetic leaf,  he said.  Every carbon is recycled: You use the artificial photosynthesis system to produce the fuel, burn it, capture it and convert it back to fuel again, so there will be no net CO2 emissions if this technology is ultimately implemented.  Both breakthroughs used a similar system: a membrane of semiconductor nanowires that can harness solar energy, populated with bacteria that can feed off this energy and use it to produce a specific carbon-based chemical.  While we were inspired by the process of natural photosynthesis and continue to learn from it, by adding nanotechnology to help improve the efficiency of natural systems we are showing that sometimes we can do even better than nature,  Yang said. For Yang, the award came totally out of the blue, since he assumed that  genius grant  winners typically got the award  at a very, very early stage in their career, at the assistant professor stage,  he said.  It was a total surprise.   Professor Yang is a world leader in the synthesis and growth of new classes of nanomaterials with useful properties that cannot be matched by conventional alternatives,  said College of Chemistry dean Doug Clark.  Applications of innovations from the Yang laboratory range from producing chemicals and fuels from solar energy to creating smaller and more efficient electronic devices. The College of Chemistry is extremely pleased and proud that he has received this well-deserved recognition.  Yang was born in Suzhou, China, graduated with a bachelor s degree in chemistry from the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei in 1993 and received a Ph. D. in chemistry from Harvard University in 1997. After a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at UC Santa Barbara, he joined the UC Berkeley College of Chemistry as an assistant professor in 1999. Among his numerous awards are the National Science Foundation s A. T. Waterman Award in 2007, the 2014 Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award from the federal Energy Department, and election in 2012 to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. BothScientific American and MIT s Technology Review have named him among the country s top innovators.

In addition, the study confirms six  risk regions segments of chromosomes that contain several genes, which, when lost or gained, contribute to ASD risk. In combination with the 65 risk genes, this results in 71 ASD risk loci, or locations. Stephan Sanders, BMBS, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry at UCSF and first author of the new study, said,  This is the largest study of autism genetics to date, providing an unprecedented opportunity to discover the genes underlying this complex disorder.  The 65 high-confidence genes, 27 of which are newly identified in this study, fall into two main functional categories, one related to the development and function of synapses the crucial sites where communication among brain cells takes place and the other involving chromatin, the term for the DNA-protein complex that packs the genome into chromosomes in cell nuclei and governs how and when genes are expressed.  The relationship between these two broad categories is a key question in autism research,  said Sanders.  They may be two separate biological paths to the disorder, or two sides of the same coin, with the chromatin-related genes identified in this study regulating the expression of those that drive synapse formation and function, or vice versa.  The findings were made possible by a remarkable global collaboration that allowed Sanders and senior author Matthew W. State, MD, PhD, chair and Oberndorf Family Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry at UCSF, to combine new and published data into a single dataset containing genomic information from over 5,500 individuals with ASD, as well as from unaffected individuals.  Autism researchers have been at the forefront of genomic data sharing,  said State.  The current study shows again just how powerful this is. The coming together of widespread patient and family involvement in autism research, powerful new genomic technologies, and international collaboration has transformed our understanding of the genetics of ASD.  The research also sheds light on how copy number variants (CNVs) deletions or duplications of chunks of the genome, containing a number of genes, that have been tied to ASD in previous research by Sanders, State, and others relate to individual high-risk ASD genes uncovered in sequencing studies that analyzed the genome letter-by-letter. To achieve this, the work draws data from three sources. One, the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC), is a permanent repository of DNA samples from nearly 3,000 families created by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI). Each SSC family has one child affected with autism, parents unaffected by the disorder and, in a large proportion of the collection, unaffected siblings. The current work provides the first comprehensive analysis of CNVs and sequencing data from the SSC and is the culmination of seven years of work by a genetics consortium funded by SFARI. The researchers also made use of published CNV data from the Autism Genome Project, a cohort of ASD samples from approximately 50 academic and research institutions funded by Autism Speaks and the National Institutes of Health. Finally, the study made use of data from Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC), an initiative supported by the National Institute of Mental Health that allows scientists from around the world to work together on large genomic studies that couldn t be done by individual labs. In previous published research on the SSC, Sanders and State showed that de novo (Latin for  anew ) CNVs, which are not present in unaffected parents  genomes but arise spontaneously in a single sperm or egg cell just prior to conception of a child, contribute significant risk to ASD. CNVs were also implicated in ASD in previous studies of the AGP datasets. In addition, Sanders and State were part of one of the first groups to establish that small de novo changes in the DNA code that disrupt only a single gene also contribute to ASD. This analysis was performed using whole-exome sequencing, a high-resolution approach that allows scientists to analyze individual genes and the smallest mutations within them. One goal of the new paper was to take the  chunkier  results of CNV analyses and line them up with fine-grained exome sequencing to determine if there are meaningful overlaps in the genes affected. The new study showed that small de novo deletions those containing less than seven genes often contain a single high-risk gene that is independently identified by the exome sequencing data. In contrast, de novo deletions or duplications of more than seven genes often contain multiple low-risk genes. This has a balancing effect, explaining how mutations of a single gene can have a similar effect to mutations that delete multiple genes. A case in point is DiGeorge syndrome, a medical condition caused by a CNV deletion on chromosome 22, often resulting in a diagnosis of ASD.  We have solved a decades-old question about which of the many genes deleted in DiGeorge Syndrome is the  smoking gun  that leads to the neurological effects,  said Sanders.  The exome data reveal that there is no such gene, but rather that there are multiple genes, each of which makes a small contribution to neurodevelopmental manifestations of the disorder when deleted.  This work also provides clues regarding the well-documented sex disparity in ASD diagnoses, with males being four times as likely as females to be diagnosed with the disorder. The analysis revealed that, despite the sex bias in ASD diagnoses, the same genetic risk factors lead to ASD in both males and females. Furthermore, females diagnosed with ASD had a much greater number of de novo mutations. Together these two strands of evidence suggest that females are somehow protected from ASD, unless their mutation burden is great enough to reach a tipping point.  Females appear to be protected from autism risk, but little is known about the nature of this protection; this represents a major research interest in my lab,  Sanders said.  Obvious candidates include the effect of estrogen and testosterone on the developing brain, but so far there are no clear answers, even to these basic questions.  Some researchers have raised the possibility that de novo mutations may be associated with only the cognitive impairments seen in some cases of ASD, and that the broader aspects of social behavior affected by the disorder have their roots in other more common genetic variants. But Sanders said that  the observation of de novo mutations in individuals with ASD and high IQs supports that notion that some of these mutations can contribute to core ASD symptoms, independent of cognitive impairment.  In a 2013 study, Jeremy Willsey, an assistant professor of psychiatry at UCSF, along with State and Sanders, showed that the effects of mutations in nine important ASD genes all converged on a single cell type in the prefrontal cortex during fetal development.  Now that we have real traction discovering ASD genes, the next big challenge for the field is to understand when, where, and why autism develops,  State said.  The expanded list of high-confidence autism genes from this study is going to help tremendously.  The work was performed in collaboration with scientists and clinicians at more than 20 institutions, with particularly important contributions from Bernie Devlin, PhD, professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and Kathryn Roeder, PhD, professor of statistics and computational biology at Carnegie Mellon University.","Published: September 30, 2015"

This study looked at genetic information from more than 200,000 women.  We estimate that one in every five women in the UK have polycystic ovaries and therefore research such as this is critical to advance our understanding and help us to better tackle the disease.  said Dr John Perry, of the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, and study co-lead.  Not only did we find new genetic markers for PCOS, and confirm some linkages seen in previous studies, but our analyses also help us to understand the underlying biology of the disease in more detail. The study found that the risk of PCOS was increased by genetic variants that are known to act by increasing body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance. The findings indicate that therapies that counteract these mechanisms could be beneficial in women with PCOS.   Previous studies had suggested that weight loss has only partial benefits for women with PCOS,  said Dr Ken Ong, of the MRC Epidemiology Unit and study co-lead.  We recommend that new studies should be done to test whether more intensive efforts to reduce body weight and improve insulin resistance are effective in treating women with PCOS.  In additional to these causal links, the study also identified new genetic variants that implicate three of the four epidermal growth factor receptors, which are known targets of some modern cancer therapies. This opens up new avenues of research into future treatments in PCOS. Another new variant identified in the FSHB gene (which encodes the beta subunit of  follicle stimulating hormone  FSH), indicates that low levels of FSH may also contribute to the development of PCOS.  PCOS is a condition that impacts how a woman s ovaries work. It is very common, affecting millions of women in the UK. It is a leading cause of fertility problems and is also associated with an increased risk of developing health problems in later life, such as Type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.  The researchers used genetic information from more than 5,000 women of European ancestry who are 23andMe customers, reported having PCOS and consented to research. The study also included another 82,000 women customers of 23andMe who also consented to research but do not have the condition. Those women were used as controls for the study.  Researchers also did follow up in 2,000 other women, whose PCOS had been clinically validated, and another 100,000 women without the condition. Those women were studied by the Icelandic company deCODE, by researchers at the Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands, and also at the Center for Human Genetic Research at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, USA.

Already, as a result of this multi-year project, researchers at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine / UNC Marsico Lung Institute and Case Western University are lab-testing drugs against targets that relate to two of these regions. Researchers believe these drugs have the potential to improve lung disease in some CF patients. The study is the largest-ever genome-wide association study of cystic fibrosis or any other rare disease. Samples from 6,365 people with cystic fibrosis (CF) were collected over the course of several years at dozens of cystic fibrosis centers in order to make this project possible.   It has been an unprecedented undertaking to enroll this many patients and have this kind of data output,  said Michael Knowles, MD, professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at UNC and one of three senior co-authors.  It s mind-boggling that five regions of the genome pop out of all this data from millions of SNPs   [single nucleotide polymorphisms or genetic variations]   that we analyzed.  Now, the consortium is homing in on ways to influence these genetic locations to benefit   CF patients.  I am excited to see the fruits of this project that began in 2000,  said Preston Campbell, MD, executive vice president for medical affairs for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.  Identifying the genetic underpinnings for differences in CF lung disease will hopefully inform our precision medicine efforts and spur further drug development.  CF is a genetic disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs. This build-up makes patients more susceptible to infections, such as pneumonia. Over the past two decades, Better therapies have increased life expectancy for many patients, but disease severity varies widely even among patients with the exact same CFTR gene mutation. For instance, a six-year old could have severe disease, poor lung function, and endure multiple hospitalizations while a 25-year old may have nearly normal lung function and never be hospitalized until much later in life. The difference lies, in part, in these five genetic regions that the consortium s 12-year research project uncovered. This work is integral for CF patients because moderately improving the function of the CFTR gene, alone, won t necessarily be enough to optimize lung function for most people with the disease. A new CF drug was introduced in July. It was designed to  fix  the Delta-F mutation   the most common CFTR mutation. But the drug does not provide a complete fix. And for some people with the Delta-F mutation, the drug doesn t work at all.  The reason lies in part in these modifier genes found within the five genome locations we ve identified,  said Garry Cutting, MD, professor of pediatrics and medicine at Johns Hopkins and senior co-author of the paper.  Some of these genes create proteins that have a functional interaction with the CFTR gene, or have complementary roles to protect the lung against ongoing damage. They play important supporting roles to make sure the CFTR protein and other proteins and protective mechanisms work properly. We need to influence these modifier proteins in order to lessen the severity of disease for patients.  The International CF Modifier Consortium   which is led by researchers from UNC, the University of Toronto, Johns Hopkins University, Case Western University, and the University of Paris   analyzed more than 8.5 million SNPs   or DNA sequence variations   over the span of 12 months to find the five genetic locations on chromosomes 3, 5, 6, 11, and X that were significantly associated with variation of lung disease. The consortium is now trying to link these genetic polymorphisms to gene expression   the amounts of proteins that genes create. This would allow them and other researchers to design more targeted therapies to lessen disease severity, decrease infections and hospitalizations, and prolong life.

Led by Veritas Genetics Co-Founder Dr. George Church, Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and Director of the Personal Genome Project, PGP is a long-term effort to sequence thousands of complete genomes to enable research into personal genomics and personalized medicine. PGP has more than 16,000 participants worldwide.  The  $1,000 Genome  has long been considered the tipping point when sequencing and interpreting the human genome becomes commonplace and begins to rapidly increase what is known and to dramatically impact healthcare. The catchphrase underscores how far science has come since the actual cost of the Human Genome Project, estimated at $2.7 billion spent over a decade.  Since then, others have touted the $1,000 genome, but never before has an organization been able to include interpretation, which is the key to applying genetic information into decisions about disease monitoring, prevention, nutrition, exercise, and more.  This is a true milestone worth celebrating, since it includes interpretation and genetic counseling,  says Dr. Church.  Veritas Genetics  collaboration with PGP is a natural step. Three of the company founders have over 10 years of experience in processing and understanding whole genomes from their work with PGP. In addition to Dr. Church, Veritas Genetics  Chief Scientific Officer Preston Estep is PGP s Director of Sequencing, and Dr. Joseph Thakuria, the company s Chief Medical Officer, serves as PGP s Medical Director.   Today s announcement is a watershed moment that will truly change the way we take care of ourselves and our families,  says Mirza Cifric, Veritas Genetics  CEO and Founder.  While the cost of sequencing has dramatically declined, there is still a need for interpretation and information that is tangible and actionable to help individuals live better and longer lives. At Veritas, we are unlocking the potential of the $1,000 genome starting with early adopters, PGP participants. You can expect to see much more from us on this topic as we expand access beyond the PGP.  In June 2015, Veritas Genetics broke a similar barrier for breast and ovarian cancer by making its myBRCA genetic screening test of BRCA1 and BRCA2 available for $199. The myBRCA test showcases the range of genetic testing that Veritas Genetics will be offering, from specific panel tests through whole human genome sequencing. ","Published: September 30, 2015"

When scores were averaged across all facial forensics examiners modeling the forensic-lab practice of engaging several examiners to weigh in on face comparison decisions the experts achieved a near-perfect mark of 0.997. The research responds to a 2009 National Academy of Sciences report that called for efforts to build the scientific foundation that supports forensic practices. The report recommended that NIST, among other organizations, develop protocols and best practices that form the basis for standards. Trained facial examiners testify in court on whether faces in two images are of the same person. Until now, however, the accuracy of forensic examiners in matching identity across different photographs had never been tested.In this initial set of experiments, the scientists tested three groups: forensic facial examiners who are specially trained to compare facial images for law enforcement, people who work in the field of facial recognition but are not examiners, and students. All participants reviewed pairs of faces on a computer screen and judged whether the faces belonged to the same person. The faces were chosen because they were hard to recognize very difficult for computer algorithms to distinguish between. The participants performed a standard face-matching test and two new tests devised by the researchers. In all three tests, trained examiners outperformed facial recognition controls and student controls, in that order. One of the new tests asked test participants to compare closely cropped faces that were displayed upright and upside-down. Participants were challenged to compare faces within 2 seconds and then 30 seconds. The examiners  accuracy improved when they had a longer time to study the faces, and they performed better than other groups with the inverted faces.  We developed this test to find out if examiners recognize faces differently than untrained people,  Phillips explains.  The results indicate that they do, and we think that their training may teach them to use additional cues. We want to learn precisely how the examiners tell the difference.  In this perceptual test, the examiners had a time limit to make comparisons. In the laboratory, examiners have access to specialized tools and perform comparisons without artificial time limits. Phillips says the next round of experiments will study the accuracy of facial examiners using their tools and methods in a laboratory.","Published: September 30, 2015"

It is being applied to general NMR research, reaction monitoring and teaching at the undergraduate level. Dr Alan Kenwright is Reader in Spectroscopy and Manager of the solution-state NMR facility in the Chemistry Department at Durham University. His personal research is focussed on developing and using NMR techniques to solve a range of chemical problems, but in addition to that (and growing out of it), he works in collaboration with a number of other research groups looking at specific problems where specialist NMR techniques can make a significant contribution. In choosing to use Magritek's Spinsolve, Dr Kenwright anticipates it will allow the extension of his work in various areas in ways that he could not otherwise. Spinsolve is not a replacement for the existing NMR equipment but is seen rather as a complement to these facilities extending the scope of what the group can do. Dr Kenwright has plans to use the equipment initially in three areas. He describes these:  The first application is in looking at lanthanide complexes of the sort used as contrast agents for MRI. The details of the NMR characteristics of such agents are still not completely understood, which makes designing new,  functional contrast agents  a challenge. By  functional contrast agent,  I mean an agent that would respond selectively to some marker in the body, possibly highlighting the site of an abnormality. One key to this is to understand the behaviour of the agents as a function of the strength of the applied magnetic field, so being able to do measurements in the relatively low magnetic field (43 MHz) used by Magritek's Spinsolve is a big advantage for us, particularly as the field it uses it not very different to the field actually used in many hospital MRI scanners. These measurements using the Spinsolve are just starting to appear in the literature.  Dr Kenwright continues:  The second is looking at real time reaction monitoring using flow-through NMR techniques. This is not a new idea, but has previously been limited by the requirement to bring the reaction close to a large (static) and expensive NMR spectrometer. The small size of the Spinsolve means that we can mount it on a trolley with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and move it around the department - taking the spectrometer to the fume cupboard where the reaction is being carried out. Working with partners in industry, we are evaluating this in parallel with small footprint Mass Spectrometry to see what relevance this approach might have not just in the University laboratory but also in pilot plants and possibly even at production scale.   Thirdly, we are planning to use the equipment in our first year teaching labs to allow students to go through the whole process of preparing and running an NMR spectrum for themselves. As many process become more automated, the opportunities for students to get involved  hands-on  become less, so exposing them to a robust, simple instrument they can use themselves is a big plus.

This is based on its focused investments at its current site in Grangemouth UK and its recent acquisition of Coldstream   a specialised ADC fill/finish site, in Kentucky, USA. The CDMO sees the market for commercial ADCs accelerating over the next few years and a steady increase in number of potential drug targets entering into the clinical phase. Piramal expects about eight drugs to move into its commercial production by 2020 which is a significant jump considering it only manufactures one commercial product today. The CDMO suggests that despite the increase in development targets for ADCs, the global contract manufacturing sector still remains significantly under resourced with only a handful of players with experience and even less with the required regulatory accreditations. Piramal is now in its fifth year of commercial production on the first ever commercial ADC in the market and is using this landmark to look ahead five-years to cement its position as a leader in manufacturing of ADCs. Over the last decade, Piramal has gradually expanded its internal teams and has nearly 150 ADCs specialists across its global sites. There are currently two commercialised ADCs on the market and Vivek Sharma, CEO   Pharma Solutions, Piramal Enterprises, commented:  the situation with ADCs mirrors what happened when Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) first started to commercialize. At present, very few CMOs have the facilities or, just as crucially, the experience to develop them. At the moment there are only two CMOs, including ourselves, which are leading the charge in the commercial manufacturing of ADCs. Piramal is targeting winning at least one in every two commercial contracts coming to market over the next few years .  Piramal views the acquisition of Coldstream s fill finish site earlier this year as the final piece in the jigsaw puzzle and is now bullish about its prospects in the market. Present bottlenecks begin with the small number of quality CMOs that can bring a product through clinical development. Second, the uneven spread of targets with most currently in very early stage research. Recognising this, Piramal has introduced a new  Proof of Concept  service, designed to bring the most promising targets into clinical development more quickly. Vivek Sharma adds:  For a pharma client, working with Piramal is an efficient and smart choice as we can take the product all the way from Proof of Concept to commercial manufacture.  We have worked on over 24 different products that include fill/finish and conjugation technologies, and have the track record and the experience of bringing a product to market. Our biotech and medium sized pharma clients understand the benefits of working with an experienced partner and prefer to leverage our expertise, instead of locking resources in developing the capabilities for ADC manufacturing in-house.  Research on ADC targets shows that there will be at least a further 50 entering clinical work by 2020 - over the next few years it is likely there will be a wave of consolidations within the CDMO sector to acquire technology. Vivek Sharma comments:  We have been in the ADC market for over 10 years, and it is an expertise we have built both organically and inorganically. We see the next 5 years as an exciting time for the ADC market and it will possibly have a sizeable contribution in the total Biological CMO market""","Published: September 30, 2015"

The resulting images are worthy of a sci-fi movie teaser, but could be valuable in disrupting the real, crippling brain infection that kills more than 600,000 people worldwide each year. Airborne cells of Cryptococcus make their way into our lungs practically every day -- unwelcome guests, but of little consequence for those with healthy immune systems. But for those with compromised immunities, whether by HIV infection or cancer treatment, a resulting Cryptococcal meningitis infection can quickly become deadly. To be able to target the infection with medications in the future, researchers need to know more about how the organism (technically a yeast), moves from the lungs into the blood stream and through the blood-brain barrier. So they injected the organism into microscopic zebrafish larvae, which have clear bodies, and watched the infection take hold. The newly developed fish model is described in mBio, a journal of the American Society of Microbiology ""What's impressive is that, unlike in a mouse or rabbit, you can actually see the organism producing disease in the live animal,"" said John R. Perfect, M.D., chief of the division of infectious diseases at Duke University School of Medicine. ""Day-by-day, it's growing and moving throughout the body. You can't see this anywhere else."" A video shows a transparent larva's body as Cryptococcus fungi, made red by a fluorescent tracer, moves through tissue, blood vessels and into the brain. Blue macrophages chase and gobble up some of the red infection as it spreads through and around green blood vessels. Using a zebrafish to observe the process of infection offers a small vertebrate animal with an immune system somewhat similar to a human's, Perfect said. Because the fish are tiny and easy to reproduce, they cost less and are easier to study than a mouse or larger mammal. The larvae are also permeable to small molecules, which will allow scientists to batch-test different drug compounds against the infection relatively quickly and easily, said co-author David Tobin, Ph.D., assistant professor in molecular genetics and microbiology and immunology at Duke. ""This model will allow researchers to screen the whole organism while it is living with an infection,"" Tobin said. ""It will allow us to screen libraries of drug compounds relatively quickly. We can also develop and test mutant strains of Cryptococcus in these larvae. This can teach us which factors play a role in infection and those could be therapeutic targets in the future."" Tobin also uses zebrafish to study bacteria closely related to those that cause tuberculosis, and findings from this model have been applied to understanding human disease. There are some drawbacks to studying these infections in fish -- their body temperatures are cooler and they lack lungs, which is where Cryptococcus enters the human body, Perfect said. But the fish offer a starting point to create leads that scientists can then investigate further in more complex mammals. ""Our hope is that by creating this system, we can continue our own investigations into other harmful organisms, and that other scientists worldwide can adapt our zebrafish model to investigate the diseases that are priorities in their communities,"" Perfect said.

In a new study published in Nature Neuroscience, researchers in the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) investigate how genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease may influence a key type of immune cell. Their results lay the groundwork for designing better therapeutic strategies and better prediction tools for risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. ""There's an emerging theme in Alzheimer's genetics that the immune system may be strongly involved in the onset of Alzheimer's disease,"" said co-corresponding author Philip De Jager, MD, PhD, who directs the Program in Translational NeuroPsychiatric Genomics at the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at BWH. ""Before genetic studies, many thought that inflammation was a symptom of or a reaction to the disease, but our study and others build a compelling case that the immune system may be involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease."" De Jager and his team examined the levels of key proteins in relation to genetic variants that have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease in the past. The team looked at blood samples from more than 100 younger, healthy subjects as well as 61 older subjects and measured protein levels in monocytes - immune cells that can travel to various sites throughout the body, including the brain where they differentiate into macrophages, specialized for their new environment, in this case the central nervous system. One of the most intriguing results the team uncovered is connected to TREM2 - a protein that is a major target of Alzheimer's disease drug development efforts. A previous study of a population in Iceland found that a rare mutation in the gene encoding TREM2 substantially elevated a person's risk of Alzheimer's disease. However, it was unclear whether more TREM2 or less TREM2 led to this heightened risk, and follow-up studies in mice have produced conflicting results. De Jager and his colleagues found evidence that directly addresses this question, determining that higher levels of TREM2 were associated with increased risk. The team found that a genetic variant tied to a separate protein, CD33, also influenced TREM2 levels. The team's follow-up studies confirmed that the genetic variant led to more CD33, which in turn led to more TREM2. ""One interesting note about these protein associations is that we did not observe them at the mRNA level,"" said first author Gail Chan, PhD, a research fellow in the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at BWH. ""This emphasizes the amount of inter-regulation that a cell does to balance all of the related molecules in order to function correctly."" ""Up until now, it's been unclear whether it would be beneficial to increase or decrease TREM2 levels,"" said co-corresponding author Elizabeth Bradshaw, PhD, of the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at BWH. ""Further studies are needed to understand the connections we're uncovering and the roles of these proteins, but we're clearly seeing evidence that these genetic variants have an effect in this type of immune cell."" As a next step, Bradshaw, De Jager and their colleagues plan to measure CD33 and TREM2 levels in subjects as part of the Brigham Healthy Aging Project to determine if these measurements and others could be part of a diagnostic panel for predicting risk of Alzheimer's disease.

This results in a later age at menopause, which marks the end of a woman s reproductive lifetime. Previous research has shown that DNA is regularly damaged by age and by toxic substances such as cigarette smoke - hence women who smoke go through menopause 1-2 years earlier on average than non-smokers.Our cells have many mechanisms to detect and repair such damage, but cells die when too much damage accumulates. DNA is also damaged and repaired during the production of eggs   therefore these genes might also act to enhance a woman s pool of eggs which is set in early life. In a collaboration involving scientists from 177 institutions worldwide, the authors undertook a genome-wide association study of almost 70,000 women of European ancestry.  Many women today are choosing to have babies later in life, but they may find it difficult to conceive naturally because fertility starts to diminish at least 10 years before menopause,  said Dr Anna Murray from the University of Exeter, and the paper s senior author.  Our research has substantially increased our understanding of how reproductive ageing in women happens, which we hope will lead to the development of new treatments to avoid early menopause.  Dr John Perry from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge co-led the study, and said:  We have known for some time that the age at which women go through menopause is partly determined by genes. This study now tells us that there are likely hundreds of genes involved, each altering menopause age by anything from a few weeks to a year. It is striking that genes involved in DNA repair have such an important influence on the age of menopause, which we think is due to their effect on how quickly a woman s eggs are lost throughout her lifetime.  The researchers also used these genetic findings to examine links between menopause and other health conditions. They predict that every one year later that menopause occurs increases the risk of developing breast cancer by 6%. Dr Deborah Thompson from the Department of Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge also co-led this large international collaboration and said:  One particularly convincing finding was that going through menopause earlier reduces your chances of developing breast cancer and we think this is because these women have less exposure to the hormone oestrogen over their lifetime.  The next step is to understand in more detail how the genetic variations found in this study are causing alterations in the timing of menopause. Uncovering these mechanisms will hopefully lead to better treatment for conditions linked to menopause, such as infertility and also improved understanding of the heath impact of menopause, such as risk of osteoporosis and heart disease. Menopause usually occurs between ages 40 to 60 years old, indicated by the end of natural menstrual cycles and in many women by physical symptoms, such as hot flushes, disrupted sleep, and reduced energy levels. Natural menopause before the age of 40 is often called  primary ovarian insufficiency  and occurs in 1% of women.","Published: September 29, 2015"

The innovation lays the groundwork for sharply reducing severe, sometimes deadly side effects that have been a significant hurdle to advancing T cell-based treatments.  Right now we put engineered T cells into patients and just hope for the best,  said Wendell Lim, PhD, professor and chair of UCSF s Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, and senior author of a new paper on the work.  This is the first of a series of  control knobs  our lab is trying to create so doctors might have additional command over these cells once they re inside the body.  Over the past two decades, scientists pursuing cell therapy, one branch of the burgeoning field of cancer immunotherapy, have been refining cell-surface sensors known as chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs. Once inserted into T cells, CARs prompt these cells to home in on particular proteins found primarily in tumors, where they launch a series of cancer-killing immune responses.Dangers of CAR T Cell Therapy CAR-equipped T cells have proven to be remarkably successful in the treatment of various forms of chemotherapy-resistant leukemia. But CAR T cell therapy can cause side effects so serious that they may require monitoring in an Intensive Care Unit   several patients have died after receiving CAR T cells or other forms of engineered T cells.  T cells are really powerful beasts,  said Lim.  And they can be lethal when they re activated. We ve needed a remote control system that retains the power of these engineered T cells, but allows us to communicate specifically with them and manage them while they re in the body.  Some scientists have grappled with these problems by developing  suicide switches  that kill off CAR T cells if side effects become too dangerous,  but that s like shooting your own soldiers in the back,  Lim said,  and it requires completely aborting a complex and expensive treatment.  Remote-Controlled Cancer Cell Killing The UCSF team, led by first author Chia-Yung Wu, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Lim s laboratory, took the opposite approach, creating a new type of CAR T cell that is  off  by default. Like conventional CAR T cells, these newly developed T cells will navigate toward and interact with cancer cells, but will not launch any immune assault unless a specially designed drug has been administered. This controller drug forms a chemical bridge between components inside the CAR T cells, flipping the cells into an active,  on  status. When the drug is no longer present, the T cells revert to an  off  position. The power of the new system is vividly illustrated in videos taken by the researchers through microscopes. In a laboratory dish containing cells expressing a protein called CD19, which is characteristic of cancer cells, the newly engineered T cells are seen to move quickly toward those cells, but  like a trained dog,  in Lim s words,  they hold onto the cell, and don t do anything else.  Once the controller drug is added to the dish, however, the CD19-expressing cells are killed off, one by one, by the T cells. Similar results were seen when leukemia cells were implanted into mice. These cancer cells were powerfully and selectively eliminated by the Lim group s new CAR T cells, but only after the controller drug had been administered. Controlling Through Drug Dosage The drug-based remote control system devised by Lim and colleagues does more than merely switch CAR T cells between  on  and  off  states. It can also act like a rheostat: the dosage of the drug precisely regulates the level of the T cells  immune activity. These combined control capabilities could be employed to manage the various side effects of CAR T therapy. For CAR T cell treatments, T cells are removed from a patient s blood, genetically engineered to carry CARs that target the patient s tumor, then reinserted into the bloodstream to exert their effects. Once inside the body, in addition to attacking tumors directly, CAR T cells, like all T cells, release signaling molecules called cytokines, some of which recruit additional T cells to fight the tumor. Sometimes normal cells express small amounts of a cancer-associated protein targeted by a CAR T cell. Because CAR T cells placed in the bloodstream pass immediately through the heart and lungs, these tissues can be damaged before the CAR T cells reach their intended target elsewhere in the body. The control offered by the Lim laboratory s new cells would allow physicians to leave CAR T cells inactivated until the heart and lungs are less vulnerable to these  first pass  side effects. Even when CAR T cells attack only their correct target cancer cells, side effects can still occur. In tumor lysis syndrome, the body is overwhelmed by toxic substances released when many tumor cells die in rapid succession. Another side effect, known as a  cytokine storm,  is a life-threatening vicious cycle in which released cytokines summon numerous T cells to the tumor, then these newly arrived T cells release their own cytokines, and so on. By  dialing in  the level of immune response using appropriate dosages of the controller drug, doctors may be able to precisely manage these side effects to meet individual patients  needs. Proof of Principle Lim stressed that the work reported in the new paper should be considered a proof of principle   while useful for experiments, the current controller drug the UCSF team used has too short a half-life to be clinically useful   but he believes that the research provides the foundation for practical remote control of CAR T cells on the near horizon. In addition to drug control of CAR T  on  switches, members of his laboratory are exploring other techniques to accomplish this goal, such as controlling CAR T cell activation with light. While successful against blood cancers such as leukemia, CAR T cells have so far shown less efficacy against solid tumors that effect the colon, breast, prostrate, brain and other tissues. The remote control strategy developed by Lim s group may permit researchers to develop more powerful versions of CAR T cells that could attack these solid tumors, while still keeping side effects in check. Members of the Lim laboratory are also working to reduce side effects by introducing multiple CARs into T cells, so that the cells will respond to multiple characteristics that are distinctive to an individual patient s tumor, rather than to just a single protein that may also be found on normal cells.  That we can engineer CAR T cells to have slightly different, quite powerful effects   even if for a subset of patients or for certain types of cancer   is really remarkable,  Lim said.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg. ","Published: September 29, 2015"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/a-natural-light-switch-186495,A Natural Light Switch MIT scientists identify and map the protein behind a light sensing mechanism  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. MIT scientists, working with colleagues in Spain, have discovered and mapped a light-sensing protein that uses vitamin B12 to perform key functions, including gene regulation. The result, derived from studying proteins from the bacterium Thermus thermophilus, involves at least two findings of broad interest. First, it expands our knowledge of the biological role of vitamin B12, which was already understood to help convert fat into energy, and to be involved in brain formation, but has now been identified as a key part of photoreceptor proteins   the structures that allow organisms to sense and respond to light. Second, the research describes a new mode of gene regulation, in which the light-sensing proteins play a key role. In so doing, the scientists observe, the bacteria have repurposed existing protein structures that use vitamin B12, and put them to work in new ways. Nature borrowed not just the vitamin, but really the whole enzyme unit, and modified it   and made it a light sensor,  says Catherine Drennan, a professor of chemistry and biology at MIT. The paper describes the photoreceptors in three different states: in the dark, bound to DNA, and after being exposed to light.  It s wonderful that we ve been able to get all the series of structures, to understand how it works at each stage,  Drennan says. The paper has nine co-authors, including Drennan; graduate students Percival Yang-Ting Chen, Marco Jost, and Gyunghoon Kang of MIT; Jesus Fernandez-Zapata and S. Padmanabhan of the Institute of Physical Chemistry Rocasolano, in Madrid; and Monserrat Elias-Arnanz, Juan Manuel Ortiz-Guerreo, and Maria Carmen Polanco, of the University of Murcia, in Murcia, Spain.  The researchers used a combination of X-ray crystallography techniques and in-vitro analysis to study the bacteria. Drennan, who has studied enzymes that employ vitamin B12 since she was a graduate student, emphasizes that key elements of the research were performed by all the co-authors. Jost performed crystallography to establish the shapes of the structures, while the Spanish researchers, Drennan notes,  did all of the control experiments to show that we were really thinking about this right,  among other things.By studying the structures of the photoreceptor proteins in their three states, the scientists developed a more thorough understanding of the structures, and their functions, than they would have by viewing the proteins in just one state. Microbes, like many other organisms, benefit from knowing whether they are in light or darkness. The photoreceptors bind to the DNA in the dark, and prevent activity pertaining to the genes of Thermus thermophilus. When light hits the microbes, the photoreceptor structures cleave and  fall apart,  as Drennan puts it, and the bacteria start producing carotenoids, which protect the organisms from negative effects of sunlight, such as DNA damage. The research also shows that the exact manner in which the photoreceptors bind to the DNA is novel. The structures contain tetramers, four subunits of the protein, of which exactly three are bound to the genetic material   something Drennan says surprised her.  That s the best part about science,  Drennan says.  You see something novel, then you think it s not really going to be that novel, but you do the experiments [and it is].  Other scientists say the findings are significant.  It s a very exciting development,  says Rowena Matthews, a professor emerita of biological chemistry at the University of Michigan, who has read the paper. Of the newly discovered use of vitamin B12 and a derivative of it, adenosylcobalamin, Matthews adds,  There was very limited knowledge of its versatility.  Drennan adds that in the long run, the finding could have practical applications, such as the engineering of light-directed control of DNA transcription, or the development of controlled interactions between proteins.  I would be very interested in   thinking about whether there could be practical applications of this,  Drennan says.","Published: September 29, 2015"

Dr. Albain also is a member of the trial's steering committee. The test examines 21 genes from a tumor sample to determine how active the genes are. The tumor then is assigned a score between 0 and 100; the lower the score, the lower the chance the cancer will recur in distant organs if treated with only a pill such as tamoxifen. In previous studies involving fewer patients, a low score also suggested that chemotherapy does not work well and does not add to the survival benefit of tamoxifen. The clinical trial enrolled 10,253 women, including 41 at Loyola, who had a certain type of breast cancer (hormone-receptor positive, HER2 negative) that had not spread to lymph nodes. Although the lymph nodes were not involved, the tumors had other features that indicated chemotherapy should be given, followed by tamoxifen or other endocrine therapy pills. In the trial, women whose tumors scored 10 or lower on the 21-gene test received standard hormone therapy such as tamoxifen, but did not undergo chemotherapy. After five years of being followed closely, there was a less than a 2 percent risk the cancer had spread to nearby or distant sites. The five-year overall patient survival was 98 percent. These findings, researchers concluded, provide the highest level of evidence that the multigene test can spare the use of chemotherapy in women with low-scoring tumors who otherwise would receive chemotherapy. ""This should provide a lot of reassurance to women and their physicians,"" Dr. Albain said. ""In women whose breast cancer scored low on the multigene test, there was outstanding survival with endocrine therapy alone. The test provides us with greater certainty of who can safely avoid chemotherapy."" In the trial, 15.9 percent of the women had a multigene test score of 10 or lower. An additional 68 percent had a mid-range score of 11 to 25. These women were randomly assigned to receive either hormone therapy plus chemotherapy or hormone therapy alone. Continued follow-up still will be needed to determine whether any women in this larger group, with tumors in the intermediate-score range, can safely forgo chemotherapy.","Published: September 29, 2015"

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently accepted an investigational new drug application (IND) for a Phase I study to explore the safety and tolerability of MEDI9197 as a potential treatment for patients with solid tumors.  TLR agonists are promising agents that activate antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells, enhancing the visibility of a tumor to the immune system. MEDI9197 has been designed to activate a broad range of innate immune cells through targeting of both TLR 7 and 8, leading to a more robust adaptive immune response. A TLR7 and 8 dual agonist can additionally convert immune suppressive cells in the tumor to those with anti-tumor properties, allowing the generation of an effective anti-tumor response. MEDI9197 will also be the first dual TLR7and 8 agonist administered directly into a tumor in a clinical setting.  Preclinical studies demonstrate that intratumoral dosing of MEDI9197 may inhibit tumor growth of both the injected and distant lesions in multiple types of cancer, including melanoma. MEDI9197 is uniquely designed for intratumoral injection, allowing the compound to be retained in the tumor and provide specific immune activation, enhancing its safety and tolerability profile.  Yong-Jun Liu, MD, PhD, Senior Vice President, R&D and Head of Research, MedImmune, said: ""We re pleased to collaborate with 3M Drug Delivery Systems to explore TLR agonists as monotherapy and in combination with our internal immuno-oncology portfolio. By targeting tumor antigen presentation, MEDI9197 adds a unique mechanism of immune activation to our growing portfolio and supports our strategy of maximizing anti-tumor immunity through scientifically rational combinations.""  Cindy Kent, President and General Manager, 3M Drug Delivery Systems, said: ""Everyone here at 3M s Drug Delivery Systems is very excited to collaborate with MedImmune, a world leader in cancer immunotherapy. Our companies continue to work well together on this groundbreaking program and we re very pleased with the progression of MEDI9197 into the clinic. The acceptance of the IND marks an important step in exploring this unique TLR 7/8 agonist intratumoral immunotherapy approach in patients with solid tumors.""  Under the agreement, MedImmune is responsible for the clinical development and strategy for MEDI9197. 3M will continue to develop additional TLR agonists in oncology and other therapy areas, with MedImmune holding exclusive rights to conduct research on new molecules resulting from the collaboration and to determine which to progress to clinical development. The terms of the agreement include an upfront payment and development-related milestone payments for MEDI9197 in addition to research funding paid by MedImmune to 3M. 3M retains the rights to 3M-052 in certain topical applications and use in vaccine admixtures. Immuno-oncology is a promising therapeutic approach that harnesses the patient s own immune system to help fight cancer. The agreement with 3M supports AstraZeneca s strategy of developing novel combinations that target multiple mechanisms in the immune system where cancer wages its battles   T-cell activation, antigen presentation and innate immunity, and the tumor microenvironment.","Published: September 29, 2015"

Researchers have recently succeeded in growing functional kidneys from human stem cells, but these kidneys are unable to grow to full size because they have no pathway for excreting urine, resulting in a condition called hydronephrosis. Takashi Yokoo and colleagues developed a potential solution to this problem by implanting embryonic rat kidneys with bladders into adult rat hosts.  Four weeks after transplantation, the authors connected one of the host rat s ureters to the transplanted bladder. This approach allowed the urine from the transplanted kidneys to pass into the transplanted bladder and then into the host bladder, thereby avoiding hydronephrosis. Eight weeks after transplantation, the kidney tissues contained structures characteristic of mature kidneys.  To test the clinical feasibility of this system, called the stepwise peristaltic ureter (SWPU) system, the authors repeated the experiments using pigs and achieved results similar to those observed in rats. By providing a urine excretion pathway and allowing long-term growth of newly generated kidneys, the SWPU system can potentially overcome challenges in generating functional kidneys from stem cells.","Published: September 29, 2015"

Dr Nicola Fawcett is part of the Modernising Medical Microbiology research group at Oxford University, which is working to find out more about bacteria and viruses in order to control and better manage them, ultimately improving people s health. She said:  A healthy, desirable world is portrayed as one free of bacteria   sterile and scrubbed clean. It s increasingly clear that this isn t true and that we need bacteria in order to survive. One of the most important places this happens is in our partnership with the bacteria in the gut.  Some bacteria are almost always beneficial, some are harmless, and some can be harmful. Some types can get out of control and cause damage if the careful balance between humans and bacterial community is disrupted. The artwork was created to help draw attention to the research we are doing into gut bacteria, how they are affected by lifestyle, healthcare, and by antibiotics, and what that means for our health.  The work was developed from a mixture of three common gut bacteria grown on a material called chromogenic agar, which changes colour in the presence of different bacteria. Purple shows E.coli, turquoise is Citrobacter, and the dark blue was caused by a tiny amount of a multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella (over 500 times less than the other bacteria). The bacteria were stamped onto the agar, and then left to grow overnight. Each small round  dot  is a bacterial colony of a few million individual bacteria, growing together.  Mostly the colonies are so close, they merge. Generally the more numerous purple and turquoise bacteria can out-compete the dark blue Klebsiella, so that the Klebsiella colonies can only grow as big as pinpricks. This is similar to what happens in the gut, where  beneficial  bacteria can out-compete more harmful ones and keep them under control. The discs around the edge have antibiotics in them, which enter into the agar and spread out, forming a  halo  where bacteria find it harder, or impossible to grow.  One disc, marked AMC, contains Co-Amoxiclav, an antibiotic used frequently in hospitals, which kills the purple E.coli. Dr Fawcett said: For me, this is a reminder that the antibiotics I prescribe can sometimes cause unintended harm to gut bacteria that are helping to keep my patient healthy. A lot of the time, if my patient has a healthy, robust gut, the antibiotic doesn t cause any noticeable problems. Rarely, it can disrupt the balance so much that one bacteria, Clostridium difficile (or C. diff), takes over as its competition is destroyed and causes life-threatening illness. The disc marked  MEM  contains Meropenem, one of a range of antibiotics called Carbapenems, the last, really effective antibiotic that can kill a range of bacteria without toxic side effects. The dark blue Klebsiella is able to survive much closer to the Meropenem antibiotic disc, than the purple E.coli, which is killed. Dr Fawcett said:  The presence of the dark blue Klebsiella bacteria surviving close to the  last line  antibiotic shows that we are already seeing bacteria which cannot be treated with last line antibiotics. Modern medicine, including surgical operations and cancer treatment, depends on having effective antibiotics to protect people from infection. These are already running out.

Preventing this breakdown in insulin secretion is a key goal in the fight to reduce the burden of a disease that afflicts an estimated 29 million people in the United States.  This study results from a field of work called metabolomics, which uses mass spectrometry instruments to measure and trace intermediate molecules in key metabolic pathways of cells and tissues.   The Duke group focused on metabolites in islet cells that changed in response to elevated external glucose concentrations,  said co-senior author Christopher B. Newgard, Ph.D., director of the Sarah W. Stedman Nutrition and Metabolism Center and the Duke Molecular Physiology Institute.  We found a strong increase in an intermediate in the purine/nucleotide metabolic pathway -- known as adenylosuccinate, or S-AMP -- in islets stimulated with glucose.  Impairment of S-AMP production was shown to interfere with normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The Duke and University of Alberta Diabetes Institute teams were also able to demonstrate that S-AMP is capable of rescuing impaired insulin secretion in islets from people with Type 2 diabetes.   Newgard said the collaborative effort between the Duke and Alberta teams also yielded a separate finding which describes another molecular pathway that could be a potential metabolic target for insulin control. In that study, the research teams identified a process that works essentially like a dimmer switch to adjust how much or how little insulin is secreted when blood sugar increases. This dimmer switch appears to be broken in Type 2 diabetes, but the researchers found that its function can be restored.  For the moment, we have two separate mechanisms, but with further study we may find that they are more connected,  Newgard said.  Whether they are independent, additive or synergistic is unknown, so we are eager to bring the two projects together to see where that may lead. ","Published: September 29, 2015"

MRSA infections kill 11,000 people each year in the United States, and the pathogen is considered one of the world s worst drug-resistant microbes,  said principal investigator Gautam Dantas, PhD, an associate professor of pathology and immunology.  Using the drug combination to treat people has the potential to begin quickly because all three antibiotics are approved by the FDA.  The three drugs   meropenem, piperacillin and tazobactam   are from a class of antibiotics called beta-lactams that has not been effective against MRSA for decades. Working with collaborators in the microbiology laboratory at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Dantas  team tested and genetically analyzed 73 different variants of the MRSA microbe to represent a range of hospital-acquired and community-acquired forms of the pathogen. The researchers treated the various MRSA bugs with the three-drug combination and found that the treatments worked in every case. Then, in experiments conducted by collaborators at the University of Notre Dame, the team found that the drug combination cured MRSA-infected mice and was as effective against the pathogen as one of the strongest antibiotics on the market.  Without treatment, these MRSA-infected mice tend to live less than a day, but the three-drug combination cured the mice,  Dantas said.  After the treatment, the mice were thriving.  Dantas explained that the drugs, which attack the cell wall of bacteria, work in a synergistic manner, meaning they are more effective combined than each alone. The researchers also found that the drugs didn t produce resistance in MRSA bacteria   an important finding since more and more bacteria are developing resistance to available drugs.  This three-drug combination appears to prevent MRSA from becoming resistant to it,  Dantas said.  We know all bacteria eventually develop resistance to antibiotics, but this trio buys us some time, potentially a significant amount of time.  Dantas  team also is investigating other antibiotics thought to be ineffective against various bacterial pathogens to see if they, too, may work if used in combination with other drugs.  We started with MRSA because it s such a difficult bug to treat,  he said.  But we are optimistic the same type of approach may work against other deadly pathogens, such as Pseudomonas and certain virulent forms of E. coli. ","Published: September 29, 2015"

The contract,  Peripherally Acting, Non-Altering, Non-Addictive Pain Medicine for the War Fighter,  is for 18 months. In pre-clinical studies the drug candidate has shown effectiveness in alleviating several types of neuropathic pain including nerve injury, chemotherapy-induced pain as well as burn and inflammation-induced pain.  Chronic pain is a major challenge for injured service members, veterans and millions of others. Opioids are effective pain relievers for acute severe pain, but common neurological side effects include sedation, cognitive impairment, and respiratory depression. Prolonged use of opioid medicines frequently leads to loss of efficacy, addiction and abuse. In addition to service members and veterans, there are an estimated 116 million Americans affected by chronic pain syndromes.   There is an urgent need for alternatives to opioids and anticonvulsants currently used to treat pain,  said Dr. Ernesto Mu oz, Director, Translational Immunology and Preclinical Development at Kineta.  The Kineta compounds could fill a huge void in our arsenal to control chronic pain. From battlefield wounds, chronic neuropathic pain including diabetic neuropathy to pain resulting from cancer treatments, Kineta s analgesic drug candidates could represent a highly differentiated therapeutic alternative to what is on the market today. We look forward to initiating human clinical trials where we will test drug safety, tolerability and signs of initial efficacy,  Mu oz added. Kineta s CSP4 drug candidate works by inhibiting a novel, genetically validated pain target in the peripheral nervous system. Given its mechanism of action, this drug is not expected to induce chemical dependency, tolerance nor life-threatening side effects associated with opioids. CSP4 is an analog of the conopeptide RgIA, a small protein extracted from cone snail venom. Research conducted so far demonstrates that Kineta s RgIA analogs are highly selective for their target and do not present significant off-target activity.

More than 1.2 million people in the United States are living with HIV and more than 47,000 people are diagnosed annually. Now, University of Missouri researchers have made a discovery in how specialized proteins can inhibit the virus, opening the door for progress in the fight against HIV and for the production of advanced therapeutics to combat the disease. Human cells express Interferon Induced Transmembranes (IFITM) proteins that possess antiviral characteristics. These proteins have been shown to inhibit a number of viruses including influenza A, West Nile, Dengue fever and Ebola. In his study, Shan-Lu Liu, an associate professor in the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology in the School of Medicine and an investigator in the Bond Life Sciences Center at MU, targeted IFITM proteins and their antiviral function.  We have long understood that IFITM proteins have antiviral functions, but until now we did not know exactly how the proteins specifically inhibited the transmission of HIV  Liu said.  We ve known that HIV-1, the most common HIV strain, can be transmitted from cell to cell or through a cell-free transmission in which the virus floats freely. Our research discovered that IFITM proteins can help inhibit the viral cell-to-cell infection, which is the most efficient way that HIV spreads.  Jingyou Yu, a doctoral student in MU s pathobiology graduate program, conducted experiments to show that IFITM proteins, particularly IFITM2 and IFITM3, block HIV cell-to-cell transmission. Yu then partnered with Minghua Li, who is also a graduate student in pathobiology, and discovered that IFITM proteins specifically interact with the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein and inhibit its maturation that is required for viral infectivity and transmission. Additionally, Liu worked with research labs in Canada and New York, to reproduce and verify his findings.  This discovery is quite surprising, given our previous finding in PLoS Pathogens where we found that this family of proteins generally affects the lipid property of cell membrane and blocks fusion of different viruses with host cells,  said Liu.  In HIV and AIDS research, scientists are constantly learning more about virus transmission and host response to viral infections. By understanding and visualizing how some IFITM proteins can inhibit and block transmission, we are getting closer to finding better therapeutic approaches in the fight against HIV.

But more work needs to be done. We need to look at a much larger sample size and evaluate individuals from more diverse ancestral backgrounds.  Anthropologists have looked at fingerprints for years, because they are interested in human variation. But this research has looked at Level 1 details, such as pattern types and ridge counts. Forensic fingerprint analysis, which is used in criminal justice contexts, looks at Level 2 details   the more specific variations, such as bifurcations, where a fingerprint ridge splits.For this study, researchers looked at Level 1 and Level 2 details of right index-finger fingerprints for 243 individuals: 61 African American women; 61 African American men; 61 European American women; and 60 European American men. The fingerprints were analyzed to determine whether there were patterns that were specific to either sex or ancestral background. The researchers found no significant differences between men and women, but did find significant differences in the Level 2 details of fingerprints between people of European American and African American ancestry.  A lot of additional work needs to be done, but this holds promise for helping law enforcement,  Ross says.  And it s particularly important given that, in 2009, the National Academy of Sciences called for more scientific rigor in forensic science   singling out fingerprints in particular as an area that merited additional study.  This finding also tells us that there s a level of variation in fingerprints that is of interest to anthropologists, particularly in the area of global population structures   we just need to start looking at the Level 2 fingerprint details,  Ross says.","Published: September 29, 2015"

The grant, announced today, comes in the midst of a historic drought in California. Over three years of field testing, researchers will dissect mechanisms by which sorghum, a close relative of corn, is able to survive water deprivation. Peggy Lemaux, cooperative extension specialist at UC Berkeley s Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, is heading the entire project. Co-investigators are Devin Coleman-Derr, Elizabeth Purdom and John Taylor from UC Berkeley; Jeffrey Dahlberg and Robert Hutmacher from UC Agriculture and Natural Resources; Chia-Lin Wei from the DOE Joint Genome Institute; and Christer Jansson from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Historically, the genetic manipulation of crops, which has been critical to increasing agricultural productivity, has concentrated on altering the plant s genetic sequence, encoded in its DNA,  said Lemaux.  However, recent studies have shown that environmental stresses   in our case drought   can lead to epigenetic changes in a plant s genetic information. Because epigenetic changes occur without altering the underlying DNA sequence, they allow plants to respond to a changing environment more quickly.  Over the next three years, a variety of observable plant traits will be followed, such as plant height and grain yield. In addition, leaf and root samples will be taken to investigate responses to drought at the molecular level, including how gene expression changes and which proteins and metabolites are altered. Researchers will also be tracking changes in the sorghum-associated microbial communities to determine whether they correlate with changes that directly contribute to the crop s drought tolerance. It is now well known that associations of specific bacteria and fungi with plants and animals have positive effects on host fitness. For example, microbes in both plants and humans are known to help fight disease and, in the soil, can help deliver nutrients and other resources to plants. EPICON efforts will generate a variety of large datasets, which will be shared via an open, online platform that will include methods and results.  Availability of this data in an open forum will enable comparative genomic studies by other scientists,  said Coleman-Derr, a UC Berkeley adjunct assistant professor in plant and microbial biology.  Being able to analyze the large datasets in an integrated fashion will enable a more thorough understanding of the complex and interconnected processes responsible for sorghum s ability to respond positively to drought.  The researchers expect that the project will allow better predictions of how sorghum and other cereal crops are affected by future climate scenarios, and will lead to approaches to improve growth and production of sorghum and other crops under water-limiting conditions in commercial fields and on marginal lands.","Published: September 29, 2015"

The system uses direct optical detection of viral molecules and can be integrated into a simple, portable instrument for use in field situations where rapid, accurate detection of Ebola infections is needed to control outbreaks. Laboratory tests using preparations of Ebola virus and other hemorrhagic fever viruses showed that the system has the sensitivity and specificity needed to provide a viable clinical assay.  An outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa has killed more than 11,000 people since 2014, with new cases occurring recently in Guinea and Sierra Leone. The current gold standard for Ebola virus detection relies on a method called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the virus's genetic material for detection. Because PCR works on DNA molecules and Ebola is an RNA virus, the reverse transcriptase enzyme is used to make DNA copies of the viral RNA prior to PCR amplification and detection.""Compared to our system, PCR detection is more complex and requires a laboratory setting,"" said senior author Holger Schmidt, the Kapany Professor of Optoelectronics at UC Santa Cruz. ""We're detecting the nucleic acids directly, and we achieve a comparable limit of detection to PCR and excellent specificity."" Sensitivity and specificity In laboratory tests, the system provided sensitive detection of Ebola virus while giving no positive counts in tests with two related viruses, Sudan virus and Marburg virus. Testing with different concentrations of Ebola virus demonstrated accurate quantification of the virus over six orders of magnitude. Adding a ""preconcentration"" step during sample processing on the microfluidic chip extended the limit of detection well beyond that achieved by other chip-based approaches, covering a range comparable to PCR analysis. ""The measurements were taken at clinical concentrations covering the entire range of what would be seen in an infected person,"" Schmidt said. Schmidt's lab at UC Santa Cruz worked with researchers at Brigham Young University and UC Berkeley to develop the system. Virologists at Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio prepared the viral samples for testing. The system combines two small chips, a microfluidic chip for sample preparation and an optofluidic chip for optical detection. For over a decade, Schmidt and his collaborators have been developing optofluidic chip technology for optical analysis of single molecules as they pass through a tiny fluid-filled channel on the chip. The microfluidic chip for sample processing can be integrated as a second layer next to or on top of the optofluidic chip. Sample preparation Schmidt's lab designed and built the microfluidic chip in collaboration with coauthor Richard Mathies at UC Berkeley who pioneered this technology. It is made of a silicon-based polymer, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and has microvalves and fluidic channels to transport the sample between nodes for various sample preparation steps. The targeted molecules--in this case, Ebola virus RNA--are isolated by binding to a matching sequence of synthetic DNA (called an oligonucleotide) attached to magnetic microbeads. The microbeads are collected with a magnet, nontarget biomolecules are washed off, and the bound targets are then released by heating, labeled with fluorescent markers, and transferred to the optofluidic chip for optical detection. Schmidt noted that the team has not yet been able to test the system starting with raw blood samples. That will require additional sample preparation steps, and it will also have to be done in a biosafety level 4 facility. ""We are now building a prototype to bring to the Texas facility so that we can start with a blood sample and do a complete front-to-back analysis,"" Schmidt said. ""We are also working to use the same system for detecting less dangerous pathogens and do the complete analysis here at UC Santa Cruz.""","Published: September 29, 2015"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genetic-adaptations-to-diet-and-climate-195703,Genetic Adaptations to Diet and Climate Researchers found genetic variations in the Inuit of Greenland that reflect adaptations to their specific diet and climate  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. At the genetic level, any 2 people are more than 99% the same. The variations that exist can be as small as a difference in a single DNA building block called a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or as large as whole sections of the genome being copied or moved. These variations may underlie differences in susceptibility to disease, response to drugs, or reaction to environmental factors. An international team of scientists led by Dr. Rasmus Nielsen of the University of California, Berkeley, wondered whether the genomes of people who live in a challenging environment for a long period of time show adaptations to that environment. The Inuit, natives of Greenland, live in extremely cold conditions that can hover in the negative digits in winter. They eat a specialized diet, including seals and whales, that s rich in protein and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Although their ancestors arrived in Greenland less than 1,000 years ago, they lived for thousands of years before that under similar conditions in the Arctic. The scientists analyzed SNPs from 191 Inuit (once known as Eskimos) and compared them with SNPs from 60 Europeans and 44 Han Chinese that were part of other genetic variation studies. The research was funded in part by NIH s National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).  The team found marked differences in a cluster of genes that code for proteins that help process dietary fatty acids. One SNP was the same in almost all the Inuit, but only about 2% of the Europeans and 16% of the Han Chinese had it. Some variants were significantly associated with the fat composition of red blood cell membranes, which had previously been measured in a group of Inuit. These membranes reflect how fatty acids were processed from foods eaten during the past 2 to 4 months. The team found another region of genetic variation common to the Inuit that includes genes thought to be involved in the regulation of brown and brite fat cells. These cells affect heat production in response to cold exposure. The scientists noted that several of the genetic differences in the Inuit were associated with other characteristics, including a lower height and weight and lower levels of fasting insulin and LDL cholesterol levels, which could potentially protect against heart disease and diabetes. The original focus on fish oil and omega-3s came from studies of Inuit, Nielsen explains. They seemed quite healthy on their traditional diet, which is rich in fat from marine mammals, so many thought that fish oil might protect against cardiovascular disease.  We ve now found that they have unique genetic adaptations to this diet, so you cannot extrapolate from them to other populations,  Nielsen says.  A diet that is healthy for the Inuit may not necessarily be good for the rest of us. ","Published: September 29, 2015"

Osteoporosis tends to run in families, and genetics is known to play an important role in bone mineral density, a major risk factor for fractures. Scientists have already identified many genetic factors associated with bone mineral density. But these factors likely represent just a small fraction of the underlying genetic variance. Past efforts to link genetic variants with traits and diseases have largely uncovered common variants with relatively small effects. Recent studies have found less common non-coding variants with larger effects. An international team of researchers led by Dr. Brent Richards at McGill University set out to examine the role of rare genetic variants in bone mineral density and fracture risk. The scientists used data from the UK10K Project a massive, whole genome sequence based resource of the general European population; the NIH-funded 1000 Genomes Project, one of the world s earliest efforts to sequence the genomes of a large number of people; and data from several other studies. The team first performed whole genome sequencing of more than 2,800 people from the UK10K Project. They also sequenced the exomes (protein-coding regions) of more than 3,500 people. In a sophisticated analysis, the scientists compared these data with those from previous studies involving tens of thousands of other people. They then analyzed associations between the genetic variants and bone mineral density measurements taken in more than 53,000 people. Finally, they looked at data from more than 508,000 people to determine the relationship of the variants to actual bone fractures.  The team identified variants in a region near the engrailed homeobox 1 gene (EN1) that were associated with bone mineral density in the lumbar area of the spine. One variant was also associated with bone mineral density in the thigh bone at the hip (the  neck  of the femur). Both are common sites of osteoporotic fractures. The effect of these variations, the researchers found, is greater than that of any previously reported genetic variants related to bone density. Using a mouse model, the team genetically altered En1 levels and confirmed that it plays an important role in bone physiology. Loss of En1results in low bone mass, probably due to high bone turnover.  EN1 has never before been linked to osteoporosis in humans, so this opens up a brand new pathway to pursue in developing drugs to block the disease,  Richards says. The researchers also found several other variants associated with bone mineral density in specific areas, including 3 for forearm, 14 for femoral neck, and 19 for lumbar spine. These discoveries indicate that more comprehensive sequencing of diverse populations can lead to the discovery of rare variants influencing common diseases.  Our findings enhance understanding of the genetics underlying the development of osteoporosis. A variant in a region of the genome that is not coding for a protein can have a relatively large effect on a gene regulating bone health,  says Dr. Douglas Kiel, whose NIH-funded team at Hebrew SeniorLife and Harvard Medical School played a key role in the effort.  Ideally, genomic research will one day lead to more personalized interventions (precision medicine) that, in this case, will reduce bone loss and prevent fractures in older adults.

They can be damaged in various ways, including disease and traumatic injuries such as car accidents and battlefield wounds. Treatment for peripheral nerve damage depends on the specific injury. Nerve regeneration requires a complex interplay of physical and chemical cues. Current techniques for nerve repair center on grafts, in which a portion of a healthy nerve is taken (harvested) from another part of the body to replace the damaged section. However, grafts require harvesting surgery and are also limited by size and geometry. They can cause a host of problems at the donor site as well, including harmful immune responses, chronic pain, and sensory loss. A team led by Dr. Michael C. McAlpine at the University of Minnesota, Blake N. Johnson at Virginia Tech, and Dr. Xiaofeng Jia at the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University has been investigating techniques for guiding nerve regeneration. Previous attempts have been limited to linear structures that don t mimic naturally branching nerves. To create complex, customized structures, the team turned to 3-D printing, in which an object is  printed  by laying down successive layers of material in a pattern based on a digital model. The team selected the sciatic nerve in rats as a model for regeneration, as it contains a complex, mixed nerve (sensory and motor) system. The researchers removed a section and prepared a cast of the nerve to image using a 3-D light-scanning technique. After conducting scans from various angles, they assembled the images into a 3-D model of the nerve pathway. This model then served as a template for a specialized, custom-built 3-D printer to manufacture a structure mimicking the exact geometry of the original nerve tissue. The team demonstrated they could use the approach to create anatomically accurate nerve pathways. They verified they could use various materials known to be safe for use in the body, including silicone. Incorporating microgrooves in the structure helped guide nerve fiber growth. They found they could also help direct sensory and motor nerve branches to grow along separate paths by incorporating specific biochemical cues into different parts of the structure. Once they developed the approach in laboratory experiments, they tested how well the technique could regenerate complex nerve gaps in a rat model. They created 10 mm gaps in the sciatic nerve and treated the animals with customized, 3-D printed nerve scaffolds. Over a 3-month period, the rats  ability to walk improved significantly. The team also showed that conventional imaging technologies, such as CT scans and MRI, could be used to make 3-D models of nerves in the body.  This represents an important proof of concept of the 3-D printing of custom nerve guides for the regeneration of complex nerve injuries,  McAlpine says.  Someday we hope that we could have a 3-D scanner and printer right at the hospital to create custom nerve guides on site to restore nerve function. ","Published: September 29, 2015"

As per the President of the Indian Drug Manufacturers  Association (IDMA), Mr S V Veerramani, the overall pharma contract manufacturing industry is growing at 20%, providing a burgeoning opportunity for small and medium enterprises. The current market value is estimated at 50% of the domestic production, which roughly translates to US$ 5.3 bn. Multinationals hold a generous 20-25% stake in the domestic pharmaceutical market. For the basic manufacture of medical products and drugs, India has a far superior edge over nations such as China, Vietnam and Ireland, due to resources including manpower, technically knowledgeable work force, and WHO-GMP approved production premises. A substantial 40% lower cost of operation and production is clearly the highlight for multinationals to consider India for their outsourcing needs. With the advent of multinational pharmaceutical organizations, and their rapidly growing presence in the country, the concept of contract manufacturing has steadily evolved and quickly adapted, so as to encompass services such as basic manufacturing of medicinal products, formulation development, stability studies, and various stages of clinical trials. In addition, scale-up of drug syntheses, and late clinical trial studies have also been profitable protocols in this sphere. The Drug Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) has agreed to grant a waiver to Phase III studies of certain drugs in India, which are from the regulated markets of US and EU. This step is an incentive for many pharmaceutical organizations to focus on India, as the cost savings could be enormous. Also it is estimated that patented drugs worth US$ 85 bn in potential annual sales in the USA would be off patent during the period 2014-2020. Price competitiveness and manufacture of these generic drugs in the most cost efficient manner would be the key drivers boosting the prospects of the Indian players as India is known to have the world s best known low-cost manufacturing centers, with the highest number of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approved manufacturing plants outside the US. The government is also looking at incentivizing the upgradation of Schedule M facilities to WHO GMP complaint units with the help of soft loans, which would lead to additional 1000 units being certified WHO-GMP compliant, further corroborating the manufacturing processes. Dr P V Appaji, Director General Pharmexcil, mentioned that multinational companies in India have stopped manufacturing some of their products and have outsourced to Indian manufacturers. Products which are even brand leaders in its segments are also outsourced to many Indian companies and yet could retain its market share. The rising cost of manufacturing and some of the ageing plants of Europe reaching their life cycle conclusion may open up enormous opportunities to India s companies in contract manufacturing as European companies are also considering to either relocate those units in cost efficient centres like India or to outsource to India manufacturers. Beside, last five years or even more the innovative products introduced do not command vary large market value and are not block busters as they used to be earlier. Research Pipeline though now getting moderately filled, may have only moderate advantage over the existing products and hence very few of them may go on to become real block busters. Hence MNCs are now adopting the strategy of marketing the brand even after the product goes off patent by slashing down their brand s price to the level of generics. Hence to get the maximum mileage of their brands they are looking to outsource their manufacturing to more cost efficient, centres, like India and yet retain their quality and brand image. This is a newer opportunity of contract manufacturing opening up. This trend is on the rise in the domestic market and India is making an appropriate move by inviting Japan s pharma industry to locate their units in India either wholly owned or in joint partnership with India companies. Japan s companies are considering India s offer with keen interest.  Our idea is to promote Indian generics in the international markets. Around 20 Japanese companies have already evinced interest in leveraging the contract manufacturing benefits from the US FDA-approved facilities in India  as per Dr P V Appaji. The contract manufacturing space in India is expected to gain grounds in the near future and expected to grow by 17-18 per cent on a compound annual growth rate as efficiency in manufacturing and maturity of business models would lead to containment of cost of manufacturing to a great extent.","Published: September 29, 2015"

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/metamaterial-absorbers-for-infrared-inspection-technologies-200821,Metamaterial Absorbers for Infrared Inspection Technologies A metamaterial absorber capable of highly sensitive infrared detection enhances the spectroscopy of tiny molecular details  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Plasmonic metamaterials are man-made substances whose structure can be manipulated to influence the way they interact with light. As such, metamaterials offer an attractive platform for sensing applications, including infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy - a technique used to uncover details of the chemical make-up and structure of substances. Now, Atsushi Ishikawa at Okayama University and colleagues have fabricated a novel plasmonic metamaterial absorber comprised of gold and magnesium fluorine capable of high sensitivity IR detection. The metamaterial could prove invaluable in the development of next-generation IR inspection technologies. The researchers carefully designed their absorber to maximize the IR signal and minimize background noise. The metamaterial consists of 50 nm gold ribbons on a thick gold film, separated by a layer of magnesium fluorine. The wavelength of IR is longer and has less energy than visible light, meaning that it is not strong enough to excite electrons, unlike other types of spectroscopy. IR absorption spectroscopy therefore exploits the ability of IR to induce vibrations in bonded atoms. Organic compounds will absorb IR radiation corresponding to the different types of molecular vibrations present; the resulting absorption spectra tell scientists about the unique chemical structure of the compounds. To test the capabilities of the new metamaterial, the team decided to identify the stretching vibrational modes of carbon-hydrogen bonds in 16-Mercaptohexadecanoic (16-MHDA) acid. They dipped the absorber in 16-MHDA ethanol solution to encourage a self-assembling monolayer of the acid molecules to develop. Under IR radiation at different incident angles, the metamaterial-monolayer spectral output displayed distinct peaks corresponding to carbon-hydrogen stretching, with the most pronounced peaks under IR at an angle of 40 . The new metamaterial approach gave highly-detailed measurements pertaining to tiny molecular details (at the attamole level) in the 16-MHDA monolayer. The researchers hope their new technique will open doors to the development of ultrasensitive IR inspection technologies for material science and security applications. BackgroundMetamaterialsThe ability to manipulate the light absorption of materials could revolutionize many technologies, such as photovoltaic cells and thermal devices. Research into the design and development of plasmonic metamaterials is still relatively new. These materials are synthetic, and scientists can design their surface structures to exploit the behavior of surface plasmons - quasiparticles that exist on metal surfaces and interact with light - to achieve tuneable optical properties. Infrared absorption spectroscopy could be dramatically enhanced by the introduction of tuneable metamaterial-based absorbers designed to enable high-resolution detection of tiny molecular details. MethodologyThe metamaterial absorber built by the team comprised gold nano-ribbons (measuring 50 nm thick) on a gold film base, with a thin layer of magnesium fluorine separating the two gold layers. As molecular monolayers self-assemble on noble metal surfaces, they hypothesized that the gold-based metamaterial would prove a strong candidate for enabling the high-resolution measurement of IR-induced vibrational modes in self-assembling monolayers. Their approach involved covering their metamaterial absorber with an ultrathin self-assembling monolayer of 16-MDHA acid molecules. They also covered a bare gold film sample with the same monolayer for comparison. The researchers subjected the two monolayers to IR radiation at different incident angles. The monolayer on bare gold exhibited a low signal-noise ratio, and it was very difficult to see the absorption dips on the spectral output corresponding to the IR-induced carbon-hydrogen stretching in the monolayer. In contrast, the absorption dips were very well-pronounced in the spectral read-out for the metamaterial-monolayer, because the vibrational modes of the 16-MHDA molecules resonated with the plasmonic modes of the metamaterial. This so-called  resonant coupling  produced distinct peaks corresponding to IR-induced carbon-hydrogen stretching in the 16-MHDA molecular structure. The resonant coupling was dependent on the angle of the incident light, with the clearest, strongest signal at an angle of 40 . Future workThe researchers believe their absorber may open doors to new ultra-sensitive IR detection technologies. Further, their technique could be exploited in other ways - by optimizing the surface structure of other metamaterials, they could enhance resonant coupling still further and enable sensitivities down to the zeptomole level.","Published: September 29, 2015"

A group of researchers at Osaka University found that neurons in the monkey visual cortical area V4*1, one of the areas in the visual cortex, calculate the size of an object based on information on its retinal image size and the distance from the object. The neural mechanism for the perceptual phenomenon in which size was perceived to be stable even if the distance from the object changed (known as size constancy) was unknown. Many neurons in the visual cortex change their activity according to the size of visual stimulus. It was believed that neurons responded to the size of the image formed on the eye (retinal image); however, size constancy cannot be achieved by such cells alone. Ichiro Fujita and Shingo Tanaka, then student in the doctoral course of Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, examined if there were cells that express not the retinal image size, but the size of the object itself. The group analyzed neuron activity in the monkey s visual cortical area V4 and found that cells in this area integrated information about retinal image size and the distance from the object to calculate the size of the object. When an object is far away, its retinal image size becomes small, and when the object is near, its retinal image size becomes big. If neurons respond to the same retinal image size, even if the distance from the object changes, they are supposed to react to retinal image size. In contrast, if neurons convey information about object size, they are expected to react to the small retinal image when the object is far away and to react to the big retinal image when the object is near. Fujita and Tanaka found that most cells in the visual cortical area V4 reacted well to small stimuli when the stimuli were presented far away and reacted to big stimuli when stimuli were near. This is the property of a cell that expresses object size should have. This group's experiment verified that cells in the visual cortical area V4 do not react to the retinal image size but to the size of the object. These cells are thought to contribute to constancy of the perceived size regardless of changes in distance by conveying certain information about the object s size. This group s achievements clarified the neural basis of size constancy and are expected to be helpful in improving 3D image-recognition techniques and understanding causes of diseases manifesting size perception disorder. *1 Visual cortical area V4: There are more than 30 areas of different functions in the visual cortex in humans and monkeys. The visual cortical area V4 is one of them and deals with visual information used for recognizing the object such as shape, color, pattern, binocular disparity, and size.

But results from a multicenter clinical trial that included Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis indicates that adding a second drug -- an antipsychotic medication -- to the treatment regimen helps many of those patients. The findings, from a study of 468 people over age 60 and diagnosed with depression, are published in The Lancet. The study was sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health and is the largest of its kind ever undertaken in older people with depression. Previous research in younger patients with depression showed that adding a low dose of the antipsychotic drug aripiprazole (brand name Abilify) helped relieve symptoms of depression when an antidepressant alone wasn't effective. But the new study is the first to show that the same strategy also works in older adults. The two-drug combination relieved depression in a significant number of patients and also reduced the likelihood that they would have suicidal thoughts. ""It's important to remember that older adults may not respond to medications in the same way as younger adults,"" said first author Eric J. Lenze, MD, a Washington University professor of psychiatry. ""There are age-related changes in the brain and body that suggest certain treatments may work differently, in terms of benefits and side effects, in older adults. Even when a strategy works for patients in their 30s, it needs to be tested in patients in their 70s before it can be considered effective in older patients."" A 2007 study estimated that about 7 million of the nation's 39 million older Americans had clinical depression. Up to 90 percent did not receive necessary care, and 78 percent received no treatment at all. The consequences are costly: Elderly patients with clinical depression use more health-care services, spending nearly twice as much on medical care as those without the disorder. Further, the suicide rate among people over 75 is higher than in any other age group, and depression is a risk factor for dementia. Lenze, who directs the Healthy Mind Lab at Washington University School of Medicine, was the principal investigator in St. Louis. Patients also were treated at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto. ""This is a rare study because it looks at depression specifically in older adults,"" said Benoit H. Mulsant, MD, a co-author of the study and a senior scientist at CAMH in Toronto. ""It's important to treat older adults for depression, especially given that adults with late-life depression are at an increased risk of developing dementia. But this research demonstrates that older adults do respond to depression therapy."" Each study participant received an extended-release formulation of the antidepressant drug venlafaxine (brand name Effexor XR) for 12 weeks. About half of these patients still were clinically depressed after 12 weeks of treatment. ""We know that in older adults with depression, about half will not respond to medication,"" Lenze said. ""They may have a minimal response, but they'll still be depressed. The question we wanted to answer was whether there was anything else we could do for them."" So for the second phase of the study, patients who initially did not respond to the venlafaxine continued to receive the drug along with aripiprazole or a placebo. Aripiprazole often is prescribed to treat schizophrenia and manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder. The two-drug combination led to a remission of depression in 44 percent of the treatment-resistant patients, compared with only 29 percent of those who had received the placebo. ""This study is a major advance in support of evidence-based care for older adults with depression,"" said Charles F. Reynolds III, MD, a geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh, the coordinating site for the study. ""By publishing our findings in The Lancet, we hope particularly to reach primary care physicians, who provide most of the treatment for depressed older adults. The excellent safety and tolerability profile of aripiprazole, as well as its efficacy, should support its use in primary care, with appropriate medical monitoring."" Some patients who took the two-drug combination experienced restlessness. Others developed some stiffness, called mild Parkinsonism. But the side effects tended to be mild and short-lived. ""The potential benefits outweighed the side effects,"" Lenze said, adding that side effects that investigators expected to see, such as weight gain and metabolic problems, never occurred. ""Antipsychotic medications can cause increasing amounts of fat and thereby increase blood sugar, potentially contributing to diabetes,"" Lenze said. ""But compared with placebo, aripiprazole was no more likely to produce increased fat in these patients and had no effect on blood sugar, insulin or lipids."" The key remaining question, Lenze explained, involves predicting which older depressed patients with depression are likely to benefit from the two-drug combination. Learning the answer is a goal for future research. ""One of the things we see as critical to our future research will be trying to better understand the factors that make some people respond to specific forms of treatment that may not work for others,"" Lenze said.

However, the validity of this assumption needs to be tested before accepting the findings as the ground truth. Indeed, the lack of replication studies in addition to the inconsistency of neuroimaging findings severely limits the advancement of knowledge in the field of neuroscience, all of which has recently become a hot topic within the neuroscientific community. Concerned about this state of affairs, researchers at the Finnish Centre for Interdisciplinary Music Research (CIMR), University of Jyv skyl , in Finland, and from Aarhus University, in Denmark, aimed to replicate previous findings on how the brain processes music using a novel, naturalistic free listening context. Their results, published in Neuroimage, demonstrate that laboratory conditions resembling real-life contexts can yield reliable results, making findings more ecologically valid.  The more we can simulate reality in a lab in a reliable way, the more true-to-life the findings will be, and this is critical to modeling the way the brain actually understands the world , sums up Doctoral Student Iballa Burunat, the lead author of the study. The research team employed an identical methodology as in the original study, but using a new group of participants. As in the original study, participants had to just listen to the musical piece Adi s Nonino by A. Piazzolla. Researchers assessed how similar the observed brain activity was between the original and the new study. Replicating the experiment allowed the researchers to fine-tune the findings of the previous study, concluding what brain areas are involved in the processing of different musical elements, like tonality, timbre, and rhythm, and how accurately the neural correlates could be replicated for each of these musical elements. For instance, they observed that high-level musical features, such as tonality and rhythm, were less replicable than low-level (timbral) ones.  One reason for this may be that the neural processing of high-level musical features is more sensitive to state and traits of the listeners compared to the processing of low-level features, which may hinder the replication of previous findings , says Academy Professor Petri Toiviainen, from the University of Jyv skyl , a co-author of the study. When listening to a piece of music, we can t separate its auditory characteristics from its affective, cognitive, and contextual dimensions. It is precisely the integration of all these aspects that gives coherence to our listening experience. This is why taking a more naturalistic approach makes neuroscience more faithful to reality, a goal that a fully controlled setting that uses very simple and artificially created sounds falls short of. The success in replicating these findings should encourage scientists to move towards more real-life paradigms that capture the complexity of the real world.  The neuroscientific community needs to challenge the current scientific model driven by dysfunctional research practices tacitly encouraged by the  publish or perish  doctrine, which is precisely leading to the low reliability and the high discrepancy of results , states Iballa Burunat. The authors stress that more incentives are needed for replicating experiments, and agree that scientific journals should more often than not welcome replication studies to ensure that published research is robust and reliable.

Until now, viruses have been difficult to classify, said University of Illinois crop sciences and Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology professor Gustavo Caetano-Anoll s, who led the new analysis with graduate student Arshan Nasir. In its latest report, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses recognized seven orders of viruses, based on their shapes and sizes, genetic structure and means of reproducing.  Under this classification, viral families belonging to the same order have likely diverged from a common ancestral virus,  the authors wrote.  However, only 26 (of 104) viral families have been assigned to an order, and the evolutionary relationships of most of them remain unclear. Part of the confusion stems from the abundance and diversity of viruses. Less than 4,900 viruses have been identified and sequenced so far, even though scientists estimate there are more than a million viral species. Many viruses are tiny   significantly smaller than bacteria or other microbes   and contain only a handful of genes. Others, like the recently discovered mimiviruses, are huge, with genomes bigger than those of some bacteria. The new study focused on the vast repertoire of protein structures, called  folds,  that are encoded in the genomes of all cells and viruses. Folds are the structural building blocks of proteins, giving them their complex, three-dimensional shapes. By comparing fold structures across different branches of the tree of life, researchers can reconstruct the evolutionary histories of the folds and of the organisms whose genomes code for them. The researchers chose to analyze protein folds because the sequences that encode viral genomes are subject to rapid change; their high mutation rates can obscure deep evolutionary signals, Caetano-Anoll s said. Protein folds are better markers of ancient events because their three-dimensional structures can be maintained even as the sequences that code for them begin to change. Today, many viruses   including those that cause disease   take over the protein-building machinery of host cells to make copies of themselves that can then spread to other cells. Viruses often insert their own genetic material into the DNA of their hosts. In fact, the remnants of ancient viral infiltrations are now permanent features of the genomes of most cellular organisms, including humans. This knack for moving genetic material around may be evidence of viruses  primary role as  spreaders of diversity,  Caetano-Anoll s said. The researchers analyzed all of the known folds in 5,080 organisms representing every branch of the tree of life, including 3,460 viruses. Using advanced bioinformatics methods, they identified 442 protein folds that are shared between cells and viruses, and 66 that are unique to viruses.  This tells you that you can build a tree of life, because you ve found a multitude of features in viruses that have all the properties that cells have,  Caetano-Anoll s said.  Viruses also have unique components besides the components that are shared with cells.  In fact, the analysis revealed genetic sequences in viruses that are unlike anything seen in cells, Caetano-Anoll s said. This contradicts one hypothesis that viruses captured all of their genetic material from cells. This and other findings also support the idea that viruses are  creators of novelty,  he said. Using the protein-fold data available in online databases, Nasir and Caetano-Anoll s used computational methods to build trees of life that included viruses. The data suggest  that viruses originated from multiple ancient cells   and co-existed with the ancestors of modern cells,  the researchers wrote. These ancient cells likely contained segmented RNA genomes, Caetano-Anoll s said. The data also suggest that at some point in their evolutionary history, not long after modern cellular life emerged, most viruses gained the ability to encapsulate themselves in protein coats that protected their genetic payloads, enabling them to spend part of their lifecycle outside of host cells and spread, Caetano-Anoll s said. The protein folds that are unique to viruses include those that form these viral  capsids.   These capsids became more and more sophisticated with time, allowing viruses to become infectious to cells that had previously resisted them,  Nasir said.  This is the hallmark of parasitism.  Some scientists have argued that viruses are nonliving entities, bits of DNA and RNA shed by cellular life. They point to the fact that viruses are not able to replicate (reproduce) outside of host cells, and rely on cells  protein-building machinery to function. But much evidence supports the idea that viruses are not that different from other living entities, Caetano-Anoll s said.  Many organisms require other organisms to live, including bacteria that live inside cells, and fungi that engage in obligate parasitic relationships   they rely on their hosts to complete their lifecycle,  he said.  And this is what viruses do.  The discovery of the giant mimiviruses in the early 2000s challenged traditional ideas about the nature of viruses, Caetano-Anoll s said.  These giant viruses were not the tiny Ebola virus, which has only seven genes. These are massive in size and massive in genomic repertoire,  he said.  Some are as big physically and with genomes that are as big or bigger than bacteria that are parasitic.  Some giant viruses also have genes for proteins that are essential to translation, the process by which cells read gene sequences to build proteins, Caetano-Anoll s said. The lack of translational machinery in viruses was once cited as a justification for classifying them as nonliving, he said.  This is no more,  Caetano-Anoll s said.  Viruses now merit a place in the tree of life. Obviously, there is much more to viruses than we once thought. ","Published: September 28, 2015"

The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study will follow approximately 10,000 children beginning at ages 9 to10, before they initiate drug use, through the period of highest risk for substance use and other mental health disorders. Scientists will track exposure to substances (including nicotine, alcohol, and marijuana), academic achievement, cognitive skills, mental health, and brain structure and function using advanced research methods.  With advances in neuroimaging and other investigative tools, we will be able to look in greater detail at the impact of substance use on young people,  said Nora D. Volkow, M.D., director of NIH s National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).  Adolescents have access to high potency marijuana and greater varieties of nicotine delivery devices than previous generations. We want to know how that and other trends affect the trajectory of the developing brain.   The ABCD Study is an important opportunity to closely examine, in humans, the hypothesized link between adolescent alcohol abuse and long-term harmful effects on brain development and function,  said George Koob, Ph.D., director of NIH s National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA).  Recent human studies have revealed an acceleration in the typical decline in volume of neocortical areas and smaller increases in white matter volume in adolescents who transitioned to heavy drinking compared to those who did not using magnetic resonance imaging.  The ABCD Study will seek to address many questions related to substance use and development that will help inform prevention and treatment research priorities, public health strategies, and policy decisions, including:  What is the impact of occasional versus regular use of marijuana, alcohol, tobacco, and other substances, alone or in combination, on the structure and function of the developing brain?  How does the use of specific substances impact the risk for using other substances?  What are the brain pathways that link adolescent substance use and risk for mental illnesses?  What impact does substance use have on physical health, psychological development, information processing, learning and memory, academic achievement, social development, and other behaviors?

In a recently published study, Feng Zhang and his colleagues at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, with co-authors Eugene Koonin at the National Institutes of Health, Aviv Regev of the Broad Institute and the MIT Department of Biology, and John van der Oost at Wageningen University, describe the unexpected biological features of this new system and demonstrate that it can be engineered to edit the genomes of human cells.  This has dramatic potential to advance genetic engineering,  said Eric Lander, Director of the Broad Institute and one of the principal leaders of the human genome project.  The paper not only reveals the function of a previously uncharacterized CRISPR system, but also shows that Cpf1 can be harnessed for human genome editing and has remarkable and powerful features. The Cpf1 system represents a new generation of genome editing technology. CRISPR sequences were first described in 1987 and their natural biological function was initially described in 2010 and 2011. The application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system for mammalian genome editing was first reported in 2013, by Zhang and separately by George Church at Harvard. In the new study, Zhang and his collaborators searched through hundreds of CRISPR systems in different types of bacteria, searching for enzymes with useful properties that could be engineered for use in human cells. Two promising candidates were the Cpf1 enzymes from bacterial species Acidaminococcus and Lachnospiraceae, which Zhang and his colleagues then showed can target genomic loci in human cells.  We were thrilled to discover completely different CRISPR enzymes that can be harnessed for advancing research and human health,  Zhang said. The newly described Cpf1 system differs in several important ways from the previously described Cas9, with significant implications for research and therapeutics, as well as for business and intellectual property:  First: In its natural form, the DNA-cutting enzyme Cas9 forms a complex with two small RNAs, both of which are required for the cutting activity. The Cpf1 system is simpler in that it requires only a single RNA. The Cpf1 enzyme is also smaller than the standard SpCas9, making it easier to deliver into cells and tissues.  Second, and perhaps most significantly: Cpf1 cuts DNA in a different manner than Cas9.When the Cas9 complex cuts DNA, it cuts both strands at the same place, leaving  blunt ends  that often undergo mutations as they are rejoined. With the Cpf1 complex the cuts in the two strands are offset, leaving short overhangs on the exposed ends. This is expected to help with precise insertion, allowing researchers to integrate a piece of DNA more efficiently and accurately.  Third: Cpf1 cuts far away from the recognition site, meaning that even if the targeted gene becomes mutated at the cut site, it can likely still be re-cut, allowing multiple opportunities for correct editing to occur.  Fourth: the Cpf1 system provides new flexibility in choosing target sites. Like Cas9, the Cpf1 complex must first attach to a short sequence known as a PAM, and targets must be chosen that are adjacent to naturally occurring PAM sequences. The Cpf1 complex recognizes very different PAM sequences from those of Cas9. This could be an advantage in targeting some genomes, such as in the malaria parasite as well as in humans.  The unexpected properties of Cpf1 and more precise editing open the door to all sorts of applications, including in cancer research,  said Levi Garraway, an institute member of the Broad Institute, and the inaugural director of the Joint Center for Cancer Precision Medicine at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women s Hospital, and the Broad Institute. Garraway was not involved in the research.","Published: September 28, 2015"

He s even had the chance to name new viruses. His most recent discovery in seals, he dubbed phovirus. But what do animal infections have to do with human health? The seal discovery offers a clue: phovirus closely resembles hepatitis A, a virus that infects 1.4 million people worldwide. Anthony, assistant professor of Epidemiology at the Mailman School, explains that this genetic similarity could well be the result of a phenomenon called zoonosis that describes when a virus jumps from species to species. Outbreaks from HIV to Ebola are believed to have emerged from wildlife. While it s not clear yet that phovirus jumped from seals to humans or the other way around, Anthony believes that studying zoonoses can help predict the next outbreak, or at least reduce the risk that new diseases emerge. Studying animal infections has never been more important. According to Anthony, who is based at the School s Center for Infection and Immunity and travels to remote areas from Brazil to Bangladesh, spillover events are on the rise, in part because rapid development in forested areas multiplies encounters between humans and wildlife. What s more: today s spillovers are much more likely to become pandemics. With air travel, an emerging infection can spread to the other side of the world within a single day. There is a lot to learn about viruses.  We don t know where they are; we don t know what hosts they live in; we don t even know how many there are,  says Anthony. To start to fill in this information, he is taking a viral census of sorts. So far, his best estimate is between 300,000 and more than a million. This information could reveal patterns of viral diversity and distribution both geographically and within the host animals that carry them that, according to Anthony,  will get a step closer to predicting risk.

A breakthrough genetic testing method promises to change this situation by giving clinicians a powerful new tool to detect and sequence viruses. Developed by scientists at the Center for Infection and Immunity (CII) at Columbia University s Mailman School of Public Health, the Virome-Capture-Sequencing platform for Vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) is as sensitive as the gold standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays while enabling simultaneous testing for hundreds of different viruses and providing near complete sequence of their genomes. To use VirCapSeq-VERT, scientists select from among approximately 2 million genetic pieces, representing all viral taxa known to infect vertebrates. These genetic pieces are used to constitute a probe, which is introduced alongside material taken from the sample being tested. A magnetic process  pulls out  segments from the sample that match the probe; these segments are then analyzed using high-throughput sequencing. In a series of tests detailed in the study, scientists used VirCapSeq-VERT to test for a wide range of viruses in lung tissue, blood, nasal swabs, and feces. In tests of blood or tissue, the method resulted in 100 to 10,000-fold increases in viral matches compared with conventional high-throughput tests. A HARBINGER OF PRECISION MEDICINE Ian Lipkin, MD, CII director and John Snow Professor of Epidemiology, explains that heretofore high-throughput screening lacked the necessary sensitivity for detecting viruses. And PCR lacked the ability to test for multiple viruses simultaneously, making screening viruses time consuming and expensive.  By contrast, says Lipkin, senior author on the paper,  VirCapSeq-VERT is a specific, sensitive, powerful way of characterizing all of the viruses in a sample. This will be an important tool for precision medicine as well as basic and clinical research.  A major advantage of VirCapSeq-VERT is that it can collect the entire genome of viruses detected in the sample. By contrast, PCR detects a much smaller segment of the viruses  genome. CAPTURES VIRUSES EVEN AFTER THEY MUTATE The method s ability to detect a broader swath of the genome is especially useful in screening for viruses, which mutate many times faster than bacteria. VirCapSeq-VERT is able to detect and collect genetic information about viruses even if the sample doesn t exactly match the probe. According to its developers, VirCapSeq-VERT can detect a novel virus when as much as 60 percent of its sequence doesn t match the probe. When the suspect virus mutates, the technology is still able to catch it.   VirCapSeq-VERT also gives researchers a new tool for efficient viral discovery to help them find all the viruses within a population, or shed light on an emerging infectious disease. CII is already using the tool in its research and is in talks with other labs interested in using it. But VirCapSeq-VERT s most important contribution, according to Thomas Briese, associate professor and first author, will be in the clinical setting.  If you have patients you suspect has a viral disease, you can now for a very reasonable amount of money, definitively characterize all the viruses present in those individuals in order to figure out how they should be treated,  he explains. VirCapSeq-VERT costs approximately $40 when testing for 20 patients/samples, comparing favorably with other procedures like rRNA depletion (approximately $65 per sample). Among the world s best-known virus hunters, Ian Lipkin has a long track record of advances in microbiology. In the 1980s, he was the first to use subtractive cloning. A decade later, he used a similar approach to discover the first cases of West Nile virus in the Western Hemisphere. More recently, Lipkin and colleagues at CII developed mass-tag PCR and the first pan-microbial microarray. CII is also the first to use high-throughput sequencing for the discovery of novel microbes.","Published: September 28, 2015"

We welcome the research team from Phoundry; both companies share a common vision that combination therapies of optimized peptides have the potential to mimic and extend the metabolic benefits and weight loss potential associated with bariatric surgery, all potentially delivered in our proprietary once or twice yearly mini-pumps. Phoundry s team brings over 120 years of combined experience in peptide drug discovery and translational medicine insights that are invaluable to us in our target markets. Their team has a proven track record of producing medicines and they have worked for years to design optimized peptides to specifications that are a perfect fit for our targets and our mini-pump delivery systems. This acquisition represents a new and powerful engine of innovation for our company. With recent data showing up to 52% of the U.S. population now having type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes,(1) and the incidence of obesity over 35% as well, there is an urgent and growing need for game changing therapies that truly disrupt the status quo trends and the devastating human and economic consequences.   We are excited about joining Intarcia, and combining our respective technologies,  explained Paul Feldman, CEO and co-founder of Phoundry Pharmaceuticals.  We ve long held the belief that Intarcia s continuous, zero order delivery platform is the ideal method for peptide administration. Combining our highly potent, selective and stable peptides with Intarcia s ability to dial in the optimal dose for maximum efficacy, while eliminating regular self-injections with once or twice yearly administration, should set the stage for a number of novel, transformative medicines that can fundamentally change the standard of care and dramatically improve adherence with therapy over time.  Intarcia will fund the acquisition via a combination of cash and stock. The parties agreed not to disclose the specific financial terms of the transaction. Intarcia will retain all Phoundry employees as well as presence in Research Triangle Park, NC, and expects to double head count within 12-18 months. Paul Feldman will become a member of Intarcia s executive leadership team, serving as VP, Head of Discovery and Translational Medicine, while Andrew Young will become VP, Chief Scientific Officer and Ved Srivastava will assume the role of VP, Peptide Chemistry. In addition to the near-term priority focus on Diabetes and Obesity, both the Phoundry acquisition and the Numab collaboration formed earlier this year have additional R&D pipeline projects with potential in other serious chronic diseases.

Severe refractory eosinophilic asthma patients who participated in the Phase III trials were evaluated by eosinophil level and either a history of recurrent exacerbations or dependency on systemic corticosteroids. All patients were on high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another maintenance treatment. Dave Allen, Head, Respiratory Therapy Area Unit, R&D, said,  For these difficult-to-treat patients there are very limited treatment options. Many struggle to control their asthma even when taking high doses of inhaled therapies and are often reliant on daily oral corticosteroids, which can cause serious long-term side effects. This positive opinion brings us a step closer to adding a targeted biologic therapy, specifically developed for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, to our respiratory portfolio.  Mepolizumab is an anti-IL 5 monoclonal antibody that is delivered in a 100mg dose via subcutaneous injection every four weeks. The Phase III clinical development programme for mepolizumab investigated the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab in 915 patients with severe asthma who received mepolizumab in addition to standard of care. All patients in studies MEA115588 and MEA115575 had peripheral blood eosinophil levels greater than or equal to 150 cells/ L at initiation of treatment or greater than or equal to 300 cells/ L within the past 12 months. The Marketing Authorisation Application for mepolizumab was submitted to the EMA in November 2014. The CHMP positive opinion is a formal recommendation to grant marketing authorisation for mepolizumab. If approved, mepolizumab would be the first anti-IL5 biological treatment approved for use in this difficult-to-treat population.  The final decision will be made by the European Commission and is anticipated before the end of 2015. Mepolizumab is not currently approved for use anywhere in the world. Regulatory applications in a number of other countries, including the USA and Japan, have been submitted and are under review. Further submissions are planned during the course of 2015 and 2016. Safety Information In the pivotal studies of mepolizumab, the overall adverse event profile was similar between those patients receiving mepolizumab and patients receiving standard of care. The most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache (very common - may affect one or more in ten people), injection site reactions and back pain. Other commonly reported adverse events, which may affect one or more in 100 people (but less than one in ten), were lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, sore throat (pharyngitis), nasal congestion, upper area of abdominal pain, eczema, fever (pyrexia), systemic non-allergic administration-related reactions (including rash, flushing and myalgia) and hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension).  Local injection site reactions were higher in patients receiving mepolizumab subcutaneously, but were normally transient and not considered as severe. No events of anaphylaxis were attributed to mepolizumab. ","Published: September 28, 2015"

Humans carry a multitude of viruses and bacteria in their gut, on their skin and in other organs. Often, these are involved in important bodily functions. Under certain conditions, however, some can also cause diseases. The JC virus, a member of the polyoma tumor virus family, is a prime example. This pathogen was first isolated from the brain of a patient who was suffering from a rare brain disease known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The virus, which more than 60 percent of the global population are infected with, normally resides in the kidneys and certain other organs. JC virus can trigger the PML infection in the brain, which, in most cases, is fatal. Weak immune system facilitates brain infection Two studies conducted by an international team of researchers from the University of Zurich, the University Hospital Zurich, the National Institutes of Health in the USA, San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, the University of T bingen, and the UZH spin-off Neurimmune now reveal that the antibodies in PML patients often fail to recognize the JC virus they are infected with.  In healthy people, the disease never breaks out as the immune system keeps it well under control. Once the immune system is compromised, however, such as in patients with tumors, leukemia, AIDS, autoimmune diseases and certain immunosuppressive treatments, the JC virus is able to alter its genetic information and infect the brain,  explains Roland Martin, professor of neurology at the University of Zurich.   In multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, for instance, the treatment with a particular antibody, TysabriTM, prevents immune cells from reaching the brain   but at the same time, also inhibits the brain s immunosurveillance. If JC viruses enter the brain during the treatment, they go undetected, which can cause PML, the most significant side effect of the highly effective TysabriTM. Over 560 MS patients worldwide have already developed the PML brain infection. Over 20 percent of them died from the disease as there is no effective treatment to date. Only if the immune system function is completely restored can the JC virus be removed from the brain.   Active vaccination method and therapeutic antibodies developed in Zurich  The researchers now reveal potential ways to vaccinate against PML preventatively or, if the brain has already been infected, treat it with virus-specific human antibodies. By vaccinating mice and a PML patient with the virus  coating protein, the international groups were able to demonstrate that the antibody response was so strong that the patient was soon able to eliminate the JC virus. The so-called active vaccination method was developed at the University of Zurich and the University Hospital Zurich, and has already been used successfully on two more patients. The JC-virus-specific antibodies that are of interest for the treatment of the existing brain infection were developed by the group at the University of Zurich and the University Hospital Zurich together with colleagues from the University of T bingen and the biotechnology company Neurimmune in Schlieren. We made a major breakthrough, says Martin. We managed to isolate antibody-producing cells from a patient who survived PML and use them to produce neutralizing antibodies against the JC virus. These human antibodies have a major advantage: they recognize the most important mutants of the JC virus that can cause PML. They now make promising candidates for the development of a treatment for PML.","Published: September 28, 2015"

They account for about a third of all brain tumors, and hold the highest incidence and mortality rate among primary brain cancer patients, creating an urgent need for effective treatments. Certain antidepressants already in the market could lower the risk of gliomas, but there has been little evidence to support their use in patients. Now, scientists at EPFL have discovered that tricyclic antidepressants combined with anticoagulant drugs can actually slow down gliomas by causing the cancer cells to eat themselves. Gliomas arise from the supportive cells of the brain, called  glial cells  when they begin to grow uncontrollably. The normal function of glial cells is to keep the brain s neurons in place and help them function properly. There are three types of glial cells, and glioma tumors often contain a mix of these. Despite their aggressiveness and high mortality, there is currently little in the way of treatment for gliomas. Since the early 2000s, scientists have considered a category of antidepressants   called  tricyclic    as a potentially new drug that could lower the risk of gliomas. However, a small clinical trial showed them to offer little benefit to glioma patients. Making gliomas eat themselves The lab of Douglas Hanahan at EPFL approached the problem by combining tricyclic antidepressants with anticoagulant drugs (blood-thinners). In a study designed and led by Ksenya Shchors, the scientists screened anti-depressants in combination with several commercially available drugs known to have similar effects on glioma cells. The screening revealed anticoagulants as the most likely ally. The team investigated the effects of the two drugs in mice with gliomas. The animals received a  combination therapy , where they were given different doses of the drugs. The antidepressant was given orally, while the anticoagulant was injected 10-15 minutes later. Each combination therapy ran for five consecutive days. The results showed that the drugs work together against the cancer cells. Specifically, the drugs disrupt a biochemical pathway in the glioma tumor cells that controls a mechanism known as  autophagy    which literally means  to eat oneself . Low-level, controlled autophagy is a recycling mechanism that actually helps the cell survive under stressful conditions. The two drugs remove control in two different places along the autophagy pathway, causing the cells to virtually eat themselves alive. Although each drug can stimulate autophagy by itself, neither has any significant impact on the mortality of the mice with glioma. But when the EPFL scientists combined the two drugs, the lifespan of the mice doubled.  It is exciting to envision that combining two relatively inexpensive and non-toxic classes of generic drugs holds promise to make a difference in the treatment of patients with lethal brain cancer,  says Douglas Hanahan. However, he warns that it is not clear yet if patients would benefit from such treatment.  This strategy is at an early stage and requires further more work to assess its full potential.  Following up on this, the team is now making plans for early clinical trials.","Published: September 28, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/the-final-word-on-stap-211541,The Final Word on STAP Researchers fail to replicate STAP study  computational analysis reveals genomic inconsistency   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Tremendous controversy erupted in early 2014 when two papers published in Nature described how a technique called  stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency,  or STAP, could quickly and efficiently turn ordinary cells into pluripotent stem cells, that is, stem cells capable of developing into all the tissues in the body. The simplicity of the approach subjecting the cells to particular stresses like mild acid exposure seemed too good to be true. And it was. Almost immediately stem cell researchers around the world began questioning the results, as repeated attempts to replicate the findings failed. After an investigation by the journal revealed many problems and inconsistencies with the data, the papers were retracted. Despite the retractions, claims persisted that the essential science of STAP was valid and that issues of replication could be solved through refined protocols. As a result, a group of scientists representing seven international laboratories and led by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children s Hospital pooled their collective efforts to replicate STAP, which included experiments conducted in the lab where STAP was first developed. They also went beyond the original experiments and analyzed publicly available genomic sequence data with newly developed bioinformatics algorithms. Collectively, researchers worldwide were unable to replicate the findings reported in the original STAP papers. These negative results will be published soon, along with a companion paper that describes universal hallmarks of pluripotency, providing a roadmap that researchers can use to determine whether they have in fact created induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells.  The scientific process requires replicating and extending existing data,  said George Q. Daley, HMS professor of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology at Boston Children s and co-senior author on both papers addressing the STAP controversy.  We appreciate that can be difficult. We must strive for ever-higher standards of rigor up front, which can be at odds with the rush to publish in this increasingly competitive environment.  One experiment that the researchers sought to replicate involved a gene called Oct4, one of the most consistent markers of iPS cells. Most scientists agree that Oct4 is essential. To test forOct4, researchers use a green fluorescent protein that activates when Oct4 is present. In the original STAP studies, the researchers did in fact detect green fluorescence in the cells, leading them to believe that they had induced pluripotency. However, when Alejandro De Los Angeles, a scientist in the Daley lab, repeated the protocol, he noticed what researchers call  autofluorescence,  a tendency for some molecules in cells to emit light randomly when excited by lasers. The lasers used to detect green fluorescence require proper filters to separate random signal from noise. After exposing cells to the original acid treatment and adjusting for the appropriate laser filters, the researchers detected no active presence ofOct4. Another hallmark of pluripotent stem cells is their ability to form teratomas, benign tumors that arise when stem cells differentiate into multiple tissues when injected into mice. While the original STAP papers claim to have found teratomas, researchers attempting to replicate teratomas from STAP preparations discovered adverse chemical reactions that could have been mistaken for teratoma formation. Aside from this, no teratomas were found. In analyzing the original experiments, Peter Park, HMS associate professor of biomedical informatics, developed a set of algorithmic tools to analyze the original genomic data from the study. He refers to this approach as  forensic bioinformatics.  At first this was challenging because publicly available data sets from the original study were incomplete and poorly labeled. But once Park s team members had gathered enough data, they were able to determine in less than a month that the initial studies were problematic. Inferring genetic variants in the DNA of the cells from gene expression data, Francesco Ferrari, a postdoctoral fellow in the Park lab, and his colleagues found that many of the cells described as STAP cells were genomically distinct from their predecessors. In some cases, they were even different genders. In one critical experiment where STAP-derived cells were reported to behave like both embryonic and placental stem cells, it was found that the cell populations were in fact a mixture of embryonic and placental stem cells that pre-existed in the lab.  At the very least, journals should enforce proper annotation and timely deposition of datasets into public databases,  said Park.  It won t prevent this sort of thing from ever happening again, but it is an easily attainable safeguard.  Furthermore, Park emphasized the importance of careful bioinformatic analysis in these studies, noting that  if the authors, their colleagues or the referees of the manuscripts had the right expertise in genomic data analysis, the STAP cell idea could have been discredited much earlier with the data they had already generated. That would have saved so much time and effort for researchers around the world who tried to replicate the findings.   Ultimately, we need to have more checks and balances in science,  said Daley, who is also an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  Incentives in the system are so stacked toward being productive and publishing and getting grants that it can lead even very well-intentioned people into too easily accepting their own cognitive biases.

The Foundry enables the rapid design, testing, and fabrication of large sequences of genetic information so they can be assembled like building blocks for myriad medical, industrial, and agricultural applications.  Society relies on many products from the natural world that have intricate material and chemical structures, from chemicals such as antibiotics to materials like wood,  says Voigt.  We ve been limited in our ability to program living cells to redesign these products   for example, to program living cells to create materials as intricate as wood or seashells   but with new properties. Rather, products from synthetic biology have been limited to small, simple organic molecules. I want to change the scale of genetic engineering to access anything biology can do.  BTL s Nicol pioneered the application of manufacturing principles to DNA sequencing. This technology quickly scaled from deciphering a single human genome to examining thousands of organisms, including everything from soil bacteria to elephants. The Foundry is working to realize an analogous revolution in designing and writing DNA, in which instructions for useful biological functions are converted into physical DNA that can be put into living cells. This effort will be supported by DARPA funding derived from the agency s  Living Foundries: 1000 Molecules  program, which seeks to establish facilities that can rapidly engineer cells to make chemicals and materials not found in nature. To create the efficient and innovative pipeline needed to meet its goal, the Foundry collaborates with academic and industry partners. Academic partners include Michael Fischbach, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco, who has pioneered methods to find combinations of genes that encode desired functions from vast databases of sequence information.  The Foundry has made it possible to do something that used to be a figment of my imagination,  said Fischbach. Because combining these genes into a new design requires specifying a precise sequence of millions of DNA nucleotides (specified by the letters A, T, G, and C), a daunting task for an engineer to do by hand, the Foundry works with Douglas Densmore, a computer aided design expert in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Boston University. After a design is built, determining whether it works is slow due to the time required for DNA to be put into cells and for them to grow. Technology from Northwestern University allows newly built designs to be rapidly prototyped in advance in emulsions that mimic the interior of cells, cutting the time it would otherwise take for the new DNA to be put into cells that must then grow. The Foundry also interacts with industrial partners through a consortium that seeks to disseminate advances in the foundational tools to design and build DNA. Member companies span industries including chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food, energy, agriculture, and biotechnology. They represent a diversity of interests: some hope to generate functionalized textiles with integrated biological properties, while others are in search of faster ways to manufacture biofuels and versatile plastics made from green sources rather than fossil-based ingredients. Two years ago, with an infusion of $7 million in seed money from DARPA s  Living Foundries  program, Voigt and his colleagues laid the groundwork for the Foundry, creating a pipeline for swiftly assembling massive genetic systems involving many genes. They have now successfully demonstrated the viability of this platform, churning out hundreds of megabases of DNA in a fraction of the time it would have taken with conventional techniques. This work has already led to some significant advances. Early collaborations with consortium member DSM, a Dutch biotech and materials multinational company, led to the design and delivery of 6 million nucleotides of synthetic DNA   roughly equivalent to two bacterial genomes.  The Foundry is at the forefront of synthetic biology developments,  said Hans Roubos, principal scientist of bioinformatics at DSM.  This collaboration gives us a way to see what s possible and what s not, to learn what is state of the art in our industry, and to inspire our scientists.  One agricultural challenge is the delivery of nitrogenous fertilizer to cereal crops. Currently, fertilizer is chemically produced using natural gas, consuming 2% of the global energy supply. In their first major paper, published November 24, 2014, in Nature Biotechnology, Voigt and research partners described how they applied the Foundry pipeline to redesign the genetics underlying the bacterial processes that convert the nitrogen in air to ammonia. Since then, the Foundry has partnered with global leaders in nitrogen research to provide megabases of DNA to facilitate attempts to find a solution to this problem. Foundry capabilities are also enabling research in other fields, including medicine. Tapping the Foundry s resources, Voigt has begun research on how bacteria that naturally reside in humans make compounds that could be potent new drugs for infectious, autoimmune, and neurological diseases. Prior to this work, researchers could identify the genes that are likely encoding pathways to new pharmaceuticals, but had no way to make use of them for therapeutics.  The Foundry vision is to apply the pipeline to scientific challenges that are too large for industry or academia,  said Ben Gordon, the Foundry s director. Voigt explained that in the coming decades, this approach will offer critical new products in human health, agriculture, and chemistry, and serve as a mechanism for tackling some of the big problems of the world.","Published: September 28, 2015"

In the course of human evolution, the cortex has expanded as much as 1,000-fold, but how this occurred is still a mystery to scientists. The new findings support the notion that these unusual stem cells may have played an important role in the remarkable evolutionary expansion of the primate brain.  We want to know what it is about our genetic heritage that makes us unique,  said Arnold Kriegstein, MD, PhD, professor of developmental and stem cell biology and director of the Eli and Edyth Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCSF.  Looking at these early stages in development is the best opportunity to understand our brain s evolution.  Building a Brain from the Inside Out The grand architecture of the human cortex, with its hundreds of distinct cell types, begins as a uniform layer of neural stem cells and builds itself from the inside out during several months of embryonic development. Until recently, most of what scientists knew about this process came from studies of model organisms such as mice, where nearly all neurons are produced by stem cells called ventricular radial glia (vRGs) that inhabit a fertile layer of tissue deep in the brain called the ventricular zone (VZ). But recent insights suggested that the development of the human cortex might have some additional wrinkles. In 2010, Kriegstein s lab discovered a new type of neural stem cell in the human brain, which they dubbed outer radial glia (oRGs) because these cells reside farther away from the nurturing ventricles, in an outer layer of the subventricular zone (oSVZ). To the researchers  surprise, further investigations revealed that during the peak of cortical development in humans, most of the neuron production was happening in the oSVZ rather than the familiar VZ. oRG stem cells are extremely rare in mice, but common in primates, and look and behave quite differently from familiar ventricular radial glia. Their discovery immediately made Kriegstein and colleagues wonder whether this unusual group of stem cells could be a key to understanding what allowed primate brains to grow to their immense size and complexity.  We wanted to know more about the differences between these two different stem cell populations,  said Alex Pollen, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Kriegstein s lab and co-lead author of the new study.  We predicted oRGs could be a major contributor to the development of the human cortex, but at first we only had circumstantial evidence that these cells even made neurons.  Outsider Stem Cells Make Their Own Niche In the new research, Pollen and co-first author Tomasz Nowakowski, PhD, also a postdoctoral researcher in the Kriegstein lab, partnered with Fluidigm Corp. to develop a microfluidic approach to map out the transcriptional profile   the set of genes that are actively producing RNA   of cells collected from the VZ and SVZ during embryonic development. They identified gene expression profiles typical of different types of neurons, newborn neural progenitors and radial glia, as well as molecular markers differentiating oRGs and vRGs, which allowed the researchers to isolate these cells for further study. The gene activity profiles also provided several novel insights into the biology of outer radial glia. For example, researchers had previously been puzzled as to how oRG cells could maintain their generative vitality so far away from the nurturing VZ.  In the mouse, as cells move away from the ventricles, they lose their ability to differentiate into neurons,  Kriegstein explained. But the new data reveals that oRGs bring a support group with them: The cells express genes for surface markers and molecular signals that enhance their own ability to proliferate, the researchers found.  This is a surprising new feature of their biology,  Pollen said.  They generate their own stem cell niche.  The researchers used their new molecular insights to isolate oRGs in culture for the first time, and showed that these cells are prolific neuron factories. In contrast to mouse vRGs, which produce 10 to 100 daughter cells during brain development, a single human oRG can produce thousands of daughter neurons, as well as glial cells non-neuronal brain cells increasingly recognized as being responsible for a broad array of maintenance functions in the brain. New Insights into Brain Evolution, Development and Disease The discovery of human oRGs  self-renewing niche and remarkable generative capacity reinforces the idea that these cells may have been responsible for the expansion of the cerebral cortex in our primate ancestors, the researchers said. The research also presents an opportunity to greatly improve techniques for growing brain circuits in a dish that reflect the true diversity of the human brain, they said. Such techniques have the potential to enhance research into the origins of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders such as microcephaly, lissencephaly, autism and schizophrenia, which are thought to affect cell types not found in the mouse models that are often used to study such diseases. The findings may even have implications for studying glioblastoma, a common brain cancer whose ability to grow, migrate and hack into the brain s blood supply appears to rely on a pattern of gene activity similar to that now identified in these neural stem cells.  The cerebral cortex is so different in humans than in mice,  Kriegstein said.  If you re interested in how our brains evolved or in diseases of the cerebral cortex, this is a really exciting discovery.  The study represents the first salvo of a larger BRAIN Initiative-funded project in Kriegstein s lab to understand the thousands of different cell types that occupy the developing human brain  At the moment, we simply don t have a good understanding of the brain s  parts list,  Kriegstein said,  but studies like this are beginning to give us a real blueprint of how our brains are built.

In fact, patients who received one-fourth of the original clinical trial dose had up to a 20 to 25 percent decrease in mortality compared to the full dose group. About 90 percent of patients who have had a heart attack currently receive beta-blockers, a class of drug commonly prescribed to improve survival and prevent future heart attacks. Beta-blockers block the effects of adrenaline on the heart, reduce irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) and help prevent heart failure. No one was more surprised at the results than lead investigator Jeffrey Goldberger, MD, professor of Cardiology in the Department of Medicine. He launched the study when he discovered heart attack patients were being treated with much lower doses of beta-blockers than were used in clinical trials.  I thought that was terrible quality of care,  Dr. Goldberger said.  We set out on a mission to show if you treat patients with the doses that were used in the clinical trials, they will do better. We expected to see patients treated with the lower doses to have worse survival. We were shocked to discover they survived just as well, and possibly even better.  New research should be conducted to determine the most appropriate beta-blocker dose for individual patients to get the optimal benefit, said Goldberger, also director of the program in cardiac arrhythmias at the Center for Cardiovascular Innovation. The earlier clinical trials did not assess the effects of different doses. Patients are treated with lower doses for a variety of reasons. There may be concern about possible side effects that may include fatigue, sexual dysfunction and depression. In addition, when patients are started on conservative, low doses in the hospital after a heart attack, they return home so quickly, there is little time to adjust the dosage, Dr. Goldberger said. The study examined data in a multicenter registry on 6,682 patients who had a heart attack. About 90 percent were receiving beta-blockers. All the patients on beta-blockers survived longer than those who did not receive the drugs. The raw, unadjusted data showed that of the people who received the full dose, 14.7 percent died within two years; of those receiving the half dose, 12.9 percent died; for the quarter dose, 9.5 percent died and for the one-eighth dose, 11.5 percent died. OBTAIN (Outcomes of Beta-Blocker Therapy After Myocardial Infarction) is an observational multicenter registry in which beta-blocker dosing information was collected in patients with an acute heart attack at participating centers to assess the effect of dose on survival.  There is probably not one right dose for every single patient,  Dr. Goldberger said.  It doesn t make sense that the same dose will work for an 80-year-old frail man who had a small heart attack as a burly 40-year-old man with a huge heart attack.   We now need to figure out how to dose it in individual patients,  Dr. Goldberger said.  That s something no one has considered in the decades that we have been using this medication. This huge gap in knowledge has been completely unexplored. Since this is medicine we use in every single heart attack patient, we ought to figure out how to use it properly.

Scientists first described amyloids about 150 years ago; they have since been tagged as key players in Parkinson s disease, Huntington s disease, and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as Alzheimer s. However, recent findings suggest that this class of proteins may also have critical biological functions in healthy cells. MIT biologists have discovered that yeast cells need to build amyloid-like structures during the production of reproductive cells called spores. Learning more about how yeast build and then break down these protein structures could help scientists develop drugs that destroy disease-causing amyloids, the researchers say. Amyloids in the brain persist for decades. We just can t get rid of them, yet yeast cells seem to have a mechanism for getting rid of them in 15 minutes,  says Luke Berchowitz, a postdoc at MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and the paper s lead author.  If we can harness that mechanism, and really understand it, that could lead to anti-amyloid therapeutic opportunities.  Reproductive role Berchowitz and colleagues came across the yeast amyloid-forming protein known as Rim4 while investigating how sexual reproduction works in yeast. Rim4 is a protein containing long regions of disorder and stretches rich in the amino acid asparagine, which is a hallmark of a type of amyloid-forming proteins known as prions. Berchowitz and Amon had previously discovered that Rim4 latches onto messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, which carry genetic information to the cell s protein-building machinery. In the new Cell paper, the researchers found that Rim4 uses amyloid-like clusters to prevent these mRNA molecules from being transcribed into proteins. This process regulates the formation of spores   reproductive cells that are analogous to eggs and sperm, the researchers found. Yeast usually reproduce asexually, through a process called budding, but under certain high-stress conditions, they can also undergo sexual reproduction through creation of spores that fuse to form new cells. The MIT team found that as yeast cells near completion of sexual reproduction, Rim4 amyloid-like clusters are broken down, releasing mRNA required for the cells to complete meiosis   the specialized type of cell division that produces spores.  None of us anticipated that the way Rim4 actually works is by formation of these aggregates,  says Scott Keeney, a member of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who was not involved in the research.  We re used to thinking of these as toxic aggregates, so to demonstrate that they actually have a useful function in cells is intriguing.  The researchers also found preliminary data suggesting that an amyloid protein known as DAZL plays the same role in sperm formation in mice; they believe that similar proteins are probably found in every organism that reproduces sexually, including humans. Berchowitz says it is still unclear why cells rely on amyloid-forming proteins for this type of regulation, but one advantage amyloids offer is their ability to withstand the harsh environments in which sexual reproduction cells are formed.  Amyloids are stable and they re able to sequester things,  he says.  They re very tough guardians.   A great opportunity  Previously, scientists have found a few other examples of amyloid-forming proteins that have critical roles in normal cell functions: In fruit flies, persistence of memory can rely on formation of amyloid-like structures in the brain, and amyloids are also involved in the formation of the skin pigment melanin in humans. Learning more about how cells break down those amyloids could help scientists develop new drugs for disease such as Alzheimer s, Parkinson s, Huntington s, and rheumatoid arthritis. Berchowitz is now working on figuring out how yeast cells regulate the breakdown of Rim4 aggregates.  It s a great opportunity to study assembly, regulation, and function of amyloids in living cells,  he says.  It s pretty exciting that we can form them rapidly, synchronously, and abundantly.

VSCC co-director and neurosurgeon Allen Sills, M.D., and colleagues are collecting data on athletes to devise algorithms for both non-injured and concussed brains. The endeavor entails using a new, non-invasive device that measures intracranial pressure (ICP). This device, called the HS-1000, could be an answer to the controversies over sports-related concussions and the quandaries about whether and when a player should go back into the game after taking a hit. ""Currently, we have to rely largely on self-report systems -- what athletes are telling us as well as what we observe,"" Sills said. In gyms and on playing fields, coaches and certified athletic trainers currently have to rely on a Sport Concussion Recognition Tool. That's basically a scorecard based on how athletes answer questions and what can be observed. Medical professionals use a standardized tool called a SCAT3 that also relies heavily upon subjective determinations. ""What we lack with concussions is a diagnostic tool we can hook you up to and say you definitely have one or you definitely don't,"" said Tim Lee, MHA, M.S., a coordinator for the study. The competitive nature of athletes leads many to downplay or lie about their symptoms, said Sills. Luke Kornet, a forward on the Vanderbilt men's basketball team, never got a chance to tell a fib after being knocked momentarily unconscious during a March game against Stanford. He said he didn't even remember what happened. Now, he and his teammates are putting in earbuds -- one with a transmitter and the other with a receiver -- to participate in the study. The procedure takes about 12 minutes as a series of sound waves are sent through the cranial cavity. The HS-1000 offers a radical departure from current ICP measuring methods that entail drilling into the skull for the placement of sensors. Developed by HeadSense Medical Inc., it has received regulatory approvals in Europe and Israel for ICP monitoring. The company is currently seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval. Sills is assisting the company to determine whether the device has a broader application beyond monitoring ICP. He's checking to see if its measurements are sensitive enough to detect concussions. The VSCC is the only site in the world conducting this study for the Israeli company, which has a U.S. office in Akron, Ohio. Lee is gathering data from both male and female athletes between the ages of 13 and 25. Student-athletes from Battle Ground Academy in Franklin are participating in the study. ""Right now, we are just trying to burst through and get the healthy data,"" Lee said. ""The concussion data will just come as it comes. We have two concussed athletes in the study that we're gathering data on. I think we have probably around 25 or 30 healthy subjects. We are trying to get 50 of each."" The genesis of the study came about when the developers of the HS-1000 heard Sills make a presentation in Israel. They realized the device might have applications outside of a hospital setting. ""Part of our ongoing quest to improve our care for concussed athletes is to find tools that can objectively diagnose a concussion at the field of play,"" Sills said. If the Vanderbilt study shows that the device is an effective diagnostic tool for concussions, the company could obtain FDA approval for that use in the second half of 2017, said Guy Weinberg, chief executive officer of HeadSense. With the HS-1000, the earbud set is connected to an Android-based tablet programmed with software and algorithms. The measurements of resistance from the sound waves are compared to normal ranges.

New data generated by Resverlogix has demonstrated that BET inhibition by apabetalone (RVX-208) has effects on multiple biological pathways that underlie disease pathology. Specifically, apabetalone (RVX-208) has been shown to modulate the complement and coagulation pathways, known to play roles in cardiovascular disease and a variety of orphan indications. Based on these findings, Resverlogix plans to pursue a pilot proof-of-concept trial in complement mediated diseases, with the first clinical trial in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). Apabetalone (RVX-208) has been shown to downregulate multiple components of the complement and coagulation pathways both in vitro, in vivo and in the plasma of select patients treated with RVX-208 (from the ASSURE clinical trial). ""We believe that the next step in testing the potential for apabetalone to downregulate the levels (and possibly the activity) of complement components in humans, is to test it in patients with an overactive complement cascade,"" stated Dr. Ewelina Kulikowski, vice president of scientific development at Resverlogix.

A man who has contamination fears so intense he cannot bring himself to use public bathrooms. A woman who can't go to church because she fears enclosed spaces. All of these people have two things in common: they have an anxiety disorder. They're also parents. Each of these parents sought help because they struggle with anxiety, and want to prevent their children from suffering the same way. Children of anxious parents are at increased risk for developing the disorder. Yet that does not need to be the case, according to new research by University of Connecticut (UConn) Health psychiatrist Golda Ginsburg. Ginsburg and colleagues at Johns Hopkins University tested a one-year family therapy intervention as part of a study of 136 families with at least one parent with anxiety and at least one child between the ages of 6 and 13. The study, published online in The American Journal of Psychiatry, found family-based intervention works. Only 9 percent of children who participated in a therapist-directed family intervention developed anxiety after one year, compared to 21 percent in a group that received written instruction, and 31 percent in the group that did not receive any therapy or written instruction. ""The finding underscores the vulnerability of offspring of anxious parents,"" says Ginsburg. She wants to do something about that vulnerability. ""If we can identify kids at risk, let's try and prevent this."" Anxiety tends to run in families, with up to 50 percent of children of anxious parents growing up to be anxious themselves. Until now, anxiety prevention programs have been largely conducted in schools, with only modest success. For an anxious child, meeting a new peer for the first time can be paralyzing. Trying an unfamiliar food might summon worries of being poisoned. To cope with this kind of debilitating anxiety, kids start avoiding whatever provokes the anxious feelings. If they're afraid of the dark, they might insist on sleeping with all the lights on. If they're afraid of failing, they won't try new things. In extreme cases, they may refuse even to leave the house. ""Anxiety and fear are protective and adaptive,"" says Ginsburg. ""But in anxious kids they may not be, because these children have thoughts about danger and threat when there really isn't one."" Both inborn temperament and life experiences play a role, she says. The more negative experiences a person has growing up, the greater the likelihood he or she will struggle with anxiety as an adult. But there is also a component of anxiety that is learned, taught inadvertently by parents who model the behavior. It's these learned behaviors and thought patterns that interventions can help change. Most of the adults who participated in the study struggled in school and didn't tell anyone. They didn't raise their hands, or they got sick before exams. They might not have had any friends. As adults, their anxiety still limits their activities and sometimes those of their family members, and they are very motivated to help their children avoid the same. In the study, some of the families participated in eight, hour-long sessions with a trained therapist over a period of two months. Others were just given a pamphlet that contained general information about anxiety disorders and treatments. Still others received nothing at all. The families who participated in therapy were taught to identify the signs of anxiety and how to reduce it. They practiced problem-solving skills, and exercised safe exposures to whatever made their child anxious. One of the ways to reduce anxiety is the reality check -- learning to recognize when a fear is healthy and worth paying attention to (a growling dog) or unhealthy (a suspicion that the birthday cake is poisoned). ""We taught the kids how to identify scary thoughts, and how to change them,"" Ginsburg says. For example, if a child is afraid of cats and encounters one in the street, the child can first identify the scary thought: ""That cat is going to hurt me."" Then the child can test that thought -- is it likely that the cat will hurt me? No, the cat doesn't look angry. It isn't baring its teeth or hissing, it's just sitting there. OK, I can walk past that cat and it won't do anything. In general, children who participated in the intervention had lower anxiety overall than children who did not participate in the intervention with their families. Now the researchers have funding from that National Institutes of Health for a follow-up to see whether the effects are maintained over time. Ginsburg wonders whether there would be value in providing regular checkups for families on the mental health issue. Along those lines, she is considering approaching insurers about offering this kind of service to families at risk, to see if it lowers their healthcare costs overall. ""I'd say we need to change our model of mental health to a checkup method,"" Ginsburg says. ""Like going to the dentist every six months.""

The research appears in the journal Cell and highlights a possible new treatment strategy for the devastating disorders. The study focused on usually short-lived compartments called stress granules that form in cells under stress. Stress granules are just one type of the membrane-less structures or organelles that assemble as needed to handle various cell functions and then rapidly disperse. Until now, however, the mechanism underlying stress granule formation was poorly understood. Stress granules are also tied to degenerative disorders such as ALS, which is also known as Lou Gehrig s disease. Genes encoding the protein components of stress granules are often mutated in patients with ALS and other diseases. These same proteins accumulate in thread-like deposits called amyloid fibrils in the nerve and muscle cells of patients with ALS, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and inclusion body myopathy (IBM). But the unifying mechanism was a mystery.  This study provides the mechanism that links stress granules, toxic fibrils and disease,  said co-corresponding author J. Paul Taylor, MD, PhD, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator and chair of the St. Jude Department of Cell and Molecular Biology.  In addition to advancing our understanding of fundamental cell biology, the results have spurred interest in developing drugs that target the stress granule assembly process.  The disordered segment or  tail  of hnRNPA1, a protein that is sometimes mutated in ALS and related disorders, was the key to unlocking the connection among stress granules, fibrils and disease, said co-corresponding author Tanja Mittag, PhD, an assistant member of the St. Jude Department of Structural Biology. hnRNPA1 is an RNA-binding protein involved in stress granule formation. Proteins are long strings of amino acids that usually fold into specific 3-D structures. hnRNPA1 belongs to a subset of proteins with an amino acid arrangement that prevents folding of one end of the protein, which allows hnRNPA1 to adopt a variety of conformations. In this study, researchers showed that under certain conditions related to temperature, salt and protein concentrations, hnRNPA1 s disordered tail prompts the protein to condense into liquid droplets through a process called liquid phase separation. The droplets have properties similar to stress granules, including the ability to fuse and grow. Liquid phase separation is at work in a wide range of settings, including when oil and vinegar separate in salad dressing. Until recently, however, the process was not believed to play a role in normal cell function. This study is the first to link liquid phase separation to stress granule assembly.  It is amazing to find out that proteins like hnRNPA1 have appeared in nature to mediate liquid phase separation under normal physiological conditions,  Mittag said.  The long disordered tails in these proteins enable membrane-less compartmentalization in cells. In addition, liquid phase separation is probably important for a whole range of fundamental biological processes.  Working in the laboratory, researchers also showed how the mutations likely contribute to disease. When hnRNPA1 with mutations in the disordered tail underwent liquid phase separation and concentrated into droplets, the protein almost immediately formed amyloid-like fibrils. If the mutant protein did not concentrate into droplets, however, toxic fibrils did not form. The finding also suggests how mutations in genes like VCP promote disease. Previous research from Taylor and his colleagues have linked mutations in the gene to ALS and related disorders. VCP plays a role in dismantling stress granules when they are no longer needed. By allowing stress granules to persist, this study suggests that VCP mutations increase the likelihood that amyloid-like fibrils will form and spread.  Rather than attempting to target each disease-causing mutation, these findings have generated interest in developing drugs that target the stress granule assembly process,  Taylor said. Currently there are no effective therapies for ALS, FTD or IBM, which are associated with a variety of neurological changes as well as muscle weakness and paralysis that affects walking, swallowing and breathing. Government agencies and advocacy groups estimate that 30,000 U.S. residents have ALS and that FTD accounts for about 10 percent of the 5.3 million Americans with dementia. IBM is one of several related disorders that, combined, affects about 50,000 residents. St. Jude Children s Research Hospital   press release Taylor JP et al.

The study is published in the journal Cell Reports.  We have found that the level of your hunger could determine your bone structure,  said one of the senior authors, Tamas L. Horvath, the Jean and David W. Wallace Professor of Comparative Medicine, and professor of neurobiology and obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences. Horvath is also director of the Yale Program in Integrative Cell Signaling and Neurobiology of Metabolism.  The less hungry you are, the lower your bone density, and surprisingly, the effects of these neurons on bone mass are independent of the effect of the hormone leptin on these same cells.  Horvath and his team focused on agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the hypothalamus, which control feeding and compulsive behaviors. Using mice that were genetically-engineered so their cells selectively interfere with the AgRP neurons, the team found that these same cells are also involved in determining bone mass. The team further found that when the AgRP circuits were impaired, this resulted in bone loss and osteopenia in mice   the equivalent of osteoporosis in women. But when the team enhanced AgRP neuronal activity in mice, this actually promoted increased bone mass.  Taken together, these observations establish a significant regulatory role for AgRP neurons in skeletal bone metabolism independent of leptin s action,  said co-senior author Dr. Karl Insogna, professor of medicine, and director of the Yale Bone Center.  Based on our findings, it seems that the effect of AgRP neurons on bone metabolism in adults is mediated at least in part by the sympathetic nervous system, but more than one pathway is likely involved.   There are other mechanisms by which the AgRP system can affect bone mass, including actions on the thyroid, adrenal and gonad systems,  Insogna added.  Further studies are needed to assess the hormonal control of bone metabolism as a pathway modulated by AgRP neurons.  Yale University   Original reporting by: Karen N. Peart Horvath TL et al.

Even for scientists, it has not been easy to find other ways of using them. Now a group of researchers at the University of Chicago's Institute for Molecular Engineering (IME) is putting liquid crystals to work in a completely unexpected realm: as detectors for the protein fibers implicated in the development of neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Their novel approach promises an easier, less costly way to detect these fibers and to do so at a much earlier stage of their formation than has been possible before -- the stage when they are thought to be the most toxic. ""It is extremely important that one develop techniques that allow us to detect the formation of these so-called amyloid fibrils when they're first starting to grow,"" said Juan de Pablo, whose group did the new work. ""We have developed a system that allows us to detect them in a simple and inexpensive manner. And the sensitivity appears to be extremely high."" Amyloid fibrils are protein aggregates that are associated with the development of neuro-degenerative diseases including Huntington's disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and mad cow disease, as well in type II diabetes, where they damage the pancreatic islets. Scientists would like to be able to study their formation both for therapeutic reasons and so that they can test the effect of new drugs on inhibiting their growth. But the fibrils that are believed to be most harmful are too tiny to be seen using an optical microscope. So scientists have relied on elaborate and expensive fluorescence- or neutron scattering-based techniques to study them. The de Pablo group took a completely different approach. They exploited the way a liquid crystal responds to a disturbance on its surface. The scientists made a film of a liquid crystal molecule called 5CB, which de Pablo called the ""fruit fly"" of liquid crystal research because it is so well studied. Then they applied chemicals to the 5CB film that caused the molecules to align in such a way as to block the passage of light. Floating on top of the film was a membrane made of molecules resembling those found in the membranes of biological cells. And on top of that was water, into which the scientists injected the molecules that spontaneously form the toxic aggregates. ""As aggregates grow on the membrane, they imprint their shape into the liquid crystal underneath,"" said de Pablo, the Liew Family Professor in Molecular Engineering. ""The liquid crystal molecules that are at the interface become distorted: they adopt a different orientation, so that light can now go through."" This disturbance on the membrane -- the imprint of the protein fibers -- is transmitted down through the liquid crystal film, in effect amplifying it. The fibers might be tens of nanometers in diameter and a hundred nanometers long, far smaller than a red blood cell. But the disturbance they create is magnified by the liquid crystal so that it is large enough to be seen in polarized light with a simple optical microscope. Seen through the microscope, the aggregates appear as tiny bright spots in a sea of black: bright where the liquid crystal has been disturbed to let light pass. ""The liquid crystal is actually reporting what's happening to the aggregates at the interface,"" de Pablo said. ""And these bright spots become bigger and adopt the shape of the actual fibers that the protein is forming. Except you're not seeing the fibers, you're seeing the liquid crystal's response to the fibers."" The work of de Pablo's team was published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials. Co-authoring the article were IME scientists Monirosadat Sadati, Julio Armas-Perez, Jose Martinez-Gonzalez, and Juan Hernandez-Ortiz, as well as Aslin Izmitli-Apik and Nicholas Abbott of the University of Wisconsin at Madison. They relied crucially on theoretical molecular models, both to help guide them through the real system and to help them understand what they were seeing. They are now developing sensors for the amyloid fibrils that may allow experimenters to use droplets of liquid crystals in emulsion rather than the flat surfaces used in the proof-of-concept experiments. That, said de Pablo, would be a lot easier for people to use. He envisions scientists eventually being able to test small samples of blood or other body fluid using the new detectors, or for drug researchers to put the amyloid proteins in water, inject their drug, and study how the drug influences the growth of the aggregates over time. ""For research in type II diabetes or Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, having this simple platform to perform these tests at a fraction of the cost of what's required for fluorescence or neutron scattering would be very useful.""

The findings, published in the Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, report that adult survivors of pediatric posterior fossa brain tumors performed significantly lower than controls on standardized clinical tests of working memory performance administered in the study. The researchers studied the working memory of adult survivors of childhood posterior fossa brain tumors versus a healthy control sample using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and neuropsychological measures. Each group consisted of 17 participants. During fMRI, the participants completed a measure called the n-back task. They were asked to monitor a series of letters and respond ""yes"" or ""no"" with their index or middle finger on a button box if an item was presented ""n"" items before, ranging from one to three letters back. Accurately recalling a letter two or three letters back represented higher working memory capabilities. Participants also completed other standardized clinical measures. Whole-brain fMRI analyses also found survivors had significantly greater blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation in the left superior/middle frontal gyri and left parietal lobe of their brain during a verbal working memory task, demonstrating higher activation in these structures. Analyses revealed higher levels of activations in prefrontal regions were associated with lower behavioral performance on higher-load working memory tasks. ""Our goal was to identify the neural mechanisms underlying working memory difficulty in adult survivors of childhood brain tumors,"" said Tricia King, associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Georgia State. ""The results suggest that adult survivors of pediatric posterior fossa brain tumors recruited additional resources to control cognitive ability in the prefrontal lobe during increased demands for working memory. This increased prefrontal activation is associated with lower working memory performance."" Adult survivors of childhood brain tumors are at risk for neurocognitive deficits, such as working memory impairment, that contribute to poor long-term outcomes. While advances in diagnosis and treatment have led to improved clinical outcomes and increases in the five-year survival rates of pediatric brain tumor patients, research has shown that long-term childhood brain tumor survivors suffer from adverse health, disrupted quality of life, and impaired cognitive and social outcomes. Working memory deficits are also common in other neurological conditions, such as schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury, because working memory is an essential component for higher-order cognitive processes in humans. Understanding of the neural mechanism underlying working memory impairments in adult survivors of childhood brain tumors is limited and little fMRI research with these survivors has been reported.

It is commonly believed that these cravings are not just arbitrary whims, but are linked, at least to some extent, to the nutritional needs of the fetus their bodies are nurturing. This is particularly true for nutrients such as proteins and salt. What changes in the brain during pregnancy cause food cravings? More specifically, how does the brain know what the body needs and then, what changes in the brain's perception of the world lead women to seek out certain foods during pregnancy? To pursue the answers to these challenging questions, the team of Carlos Ribeiro at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown in Lisbon, chose to study the neural basis of changes in nutrient intake in female fruit flies after mating. ""Nutrition is a highly complex topic. To understand how the brain regulates nutrient intake, you need to work in an organism that gives you access to a lot of diverse technologies. In that respect, the fruit fly is unbeatable,"" says Dr. Ribeiro. ""We wanted to exploit these tools to uncover how the female fly's food preferences changed after mating. Many mammalian species increase their preference for salt during pregnancy; but until now it was not known if the fruit fly shared this behaviour."" Following a series of experiments, the researchers revealed, for the first time, not only that flies indeed share mammals' inclination towards salt during pregnancy, but also that higher salt levels in the diet result in higher production of offspring. ""We found that there is a direct correlation between the amount of salt in the diet and the amount of eggs they were able to produce,"" explains Dr. Ribeiro. ""It seems that salt is important everywhere, from flies, to elephants, to humans. It also suggests the existence of unifying biological principles underlying this behavior that could be traced across species."" Surprisingly, even though different levels of salt directly influenced offspring production, the researchers discovered that the salt craving was not based on the precise needs of the body. On the contrary, ""even if their egg production was disabled, mated females showed increased salt preference, demonstrating that salt-craving was independent of the actual needs of the body,"" says Dr. Ribeiro. It appears that the brain of the female knows that she will need more salt to produce eggs and so it automatically changes the way the animal perceives salt to allow the animal to ingest higher amounts of this important nutrient. Just as in humans, the ""tongue"" of the flies becomes much more responsive to the taste of salt, leading her to prefer saltier food. The key question now was: ""What is the biological mechanism that leads to this change in salt sensation in pregnant animals?"" According to Samuel Walker, the PhD student in the Ribeiro lab who was the main researcher of this study, during mating the male injects a molecule called Sex Peptide into the female which manipulates the taste perception of the female. ""The molecule activates neurons in the uterus of the female. From there, we found that a short chain of neuronal interactions signals the brain to  dial up the salt preference.'"" By piecing together this complicated puzzle, the researchers were able to demonstrate that salt-craving exists in flies much as it does in mammals, and that this craving plays an important role in their reproductive abilities. They were also able to identify the trigger for salt-craving and map several steps in the neural circuitry that brings about this behavioral change. ""Now"", concludes Dr. Ribeiro, ""we move on to the next question, which is to identify how the brain's response to salt changes after mating to bring about this cross-species behavior. We will continue using the fruit fly, an organism that is unbeatable in its array of genetic tools, which will be essential to understand a topic as complex as nutrition.""

Round after round, one player asks a series of questions and accurately guesses the object the other is thinking about. Sci-fi? Mind-reading superpowers? Not quite. University of Washington (UW) researchers recently used a direct brain-to-brain connection to enable pairs of participants to play a question-and-answer game by transmitting signals from one brain to the other over the Internet. The experiment, detailed in PLoS ONE, is thought to be the first to show that two brains can be directly linked to allow one person to accurately guess what's on another person's mind. ""This is the most complex brain-to-brain experiment, I think, that's been done to date in humans,"" said lead author Andrea Stocco, an assistant professor of psychology and a researcher at UW's Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences. ""It uses conscious experiences through signals that are experienced visually, and it requires two people to collaborate,"" Stocco said. Here's how it works: The first participant, or ""respondent,"" wears a cap connected to an electroencephalography (EEG) machine that records electrical brain activity. The respondent is shown an object (for example, a dog) on a computer screen, and the second participant, or ""inquirer,"" sees a list of possible objects and associated questions. With the click of a mouse, the inquirer sends a question and the respondent answers ""yes"" or ""no"" by focusing on one of two flashing LED lights attached to the monitor, which flash at different frequencies. A ""no"" or ""yes"" answer both send a signal to the inquirer via the Internet and activate a magnetic coil positioned behind the inquirer's head. But only a ""yes"" answer generates a response intense enough to stimulate the visual cortex and cause the inquirer to see a flash of light known as a ""phosphene."" The phosphene -- which might look like a blob, waves or a thin line -- is created through a brief disruption in the visual field and tells the inquirer the answer is yes. Through answers to these simple yes or no questions, the inquirer identifies the correct item. The experiment was carried out in dark rooms in two UW labs located almost a mile apart and involved five pairs of participants, who played 20 rounds of the question-and-answer game. Each game had eight objects and three questions that would solve the game if answered correctly. The sessions were a random mixture of 10 real games and 10 control games that were structured the same way. The researchers took steps to ensure participants couldn't use clues other than direct brain communication to complete the game. Inquirers wore earplugs so they couldn't hear the different sounds produced by the varying stimulation intensities of the ""yes"" and ""no"" responses. Since noise travels through the skull bone, the researchers also changed the stimulation intensities slightly from game to game and randomly used three different intensities each for ""yes"" and ""no"" answers to further reduce the chance that sound could provide clues. The researchers also repositioned the coil on the inquirer's head at the start of each game, but for the control games, added a plastic spacer undetectable to the participant that weakened the magnetic field enough to prevent the generation of phosphenes. Inquirers were not told whether they had correctly identified the items, and only the researcher on the respondent end knew whether each game was real or a control round. ""We took many steps to make sure that people were not cheating,"" Stocco said. Participants were able to guess the correct object in 72 percent of the real games, compared with just 18 percent of the control rounds. Incorrect guesses in the real games could be caused by several factors, the most likely being uncertainty about whether a phosphene had appeared. ""They have to interpret something they're seeing with their brains,"" said co-author Chantel Prat, a faculty member at the Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences and a UW associate professor of psychology. ""It's not something they've ever seen before."" Errors can also result from respondents not knowing the answers to questions or focusing on both answers, or by the brain signal transmission being interrupted by hardware problems. ""While the flashing lights are signals that we're putting into the brain, those parts of the brain are doing a million other things at any given time too,"" Prat said. The study builds on the UW team's initial experiment in 2013, when it was the first to demonstrate a direct brain-to-brain connection between humans. Other scientists have connected the brains of rats and monkeys, and transmitted brain signals from a human to a rat, using electrodes inserted into animals' brains. In the 2013 experiment, the UW team used noninvasive technology to send a person's brain signals over the Internet to control the hand motions of another person. The first experiment evolved out of research by co-author Rajesh Rao, a UW professor of computer science and engineering, on brain-computer interfaces that enable people to activate devices with their minds. In 2011, Rao began collaborating with Stocco and Prat to determine how to link two human brains together. In 2014, the researchers received a $1 million grant from the W.M. Keck Foundation that allowed them to broaden their experiments to decode more complex interactions and brain processes. They are now exploring the possibility of ""brain tutoring,"" transferring signals directly from healthy brains to ones that are developmentally impaired or impacted by external factors such as a stroke or accident, or simply to transfer knowledge from teacher to pupil. The team is also working on transmitting brain states -- for example, sending signals from an alert person to a sleepy one, or from a focused student to one who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. ""Imagine having someone with ADHD and a neurotypical student,"" Prat said. ""When the non-ADHD student is paying attention, the ADHD student's brain gets put into a state of greater attention automatically."" Many technological advancements over the past century, from the telegraph to the Internet, were created to facilitate communication between people. The UW team's work takes a different approach, using technology to strip away the need for such intermediaries. ""Evolution has spent a colossal amount of time to find ways for us and other animals to take information out of our brains and communicate it to other animals in the forms of behavior, speech and so on,"" Stocco said. ""But it requires a translation. We can only communicate part of whatever our brain processes. ""What we are doing is kind of reversing the process a step at a time by opening up this box and taking signals from the brain and with minimal translation, putting them back in another person's brain,"" he said.

However, it was largely unknown until now, how the brain signals back to the fat tissue to induce fat breakdown. Now, a breakthrough study led by Ana Domingos at Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci ncia (IGC; Portugal), in collaboration with Jeffrey Friedman's group at Rockefeller University (USA), has shown that fat tissue is innervated and that direct stimulation of neurons in fat is sufficient to induce fat breakdown. These results, published in the journal Cell, set up the stage for developing novel anti-obesity therapies. Fat tissue constitutes 20 to 25% of human body weight being an energy storage container, in the form of triglycerides. Twenty years ago Jeffrey Friedman and colleagues identified the hormone leptin, which is produced by fat cells in amounts that are proportional to the amount of fat, and informs the brain about how much fat is available in the body. Leptin functions as an ""adipostat"" neuro-endocrine signal that preserves body's fat mass in a relatively narrow range of variation. Low leptin levels increase appetite and lower basal metabolism, whereas high leptin levels blunt appetite and promote fat breakdown. However, until now it was largely unknown what circuits close the neuroendocrine loop, such that leptin action in the brain signals back to the fat. Now, the research team led by Ana Domingos, combined a variety of techniques to functionally establish, for the first time, that white fat tissue is innervated. ""We dissected these nerve fibers from mouse fat, and using molecular markers identified these as sympathetic neurons"", explains Ana Domingos. But most remarkable, ""when we used an ultra sensitive imaging technique, on the intact white fat tissue of a living mouse, we observed that fat cells can be encapsulated by these sympathetic neural terminals"". Next, researchers used genetic engineered mice, whose sympathetic neurons could be activated by blue light, to assess the functional relevance of these fat projecting neurons. Roksana Pirzgalska, a doctorate student in Domingos' laboratory and co-first author of the study explains: ""We used a powerful technique called optogenetics, to locally activate these sympathetic neurons in fat pads of mice, and observed fat breakdown and fat mass reduction."" Ana Domingos adds: ""The local activation of these neurons, leads to the release of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter, that triggers a cascade of signals in fat cells leading to fat hydrolysis. Without these neurons, leptin is unable to drive fat-breakdown"". The conclusions and future directions are clear according to Ana Domingos: ""This result provides new hopes for treating central leptin resistance, a condition in which the brains of obese people are insensitive to leptin."" Senior co-author Jeffrey Friedman adds: ""These studies add an important new piece to the puzzle that enables leptin to induce fat loss"".

""It's interesting that there isn't a big difference in the amount of debris in the fish from each location, but in the type -- plastic or fiber,"" said lead author Chelsea Rochman, a David H. Smith postdoctoral fellow in the Aquatic Health Program at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. ""We think the type of debris in the fish is driven by differences in local waste management."" 'Waiter, there's some plastic in my fish' The researchers sampled 76 fish from markets in Makassar, Indonesia, and 64 from Half Moon Bay and Princeton in California. All of the fragments recovered from fish in Indonesia were plastic. In contrast, 80 percent of the debris found in California fish was fibers, whereas not a single strand of fiber was found in Indonesian fish. Indonesia has little in the way of landfills, waste collection or recycling, and large amounts of plastic are tossed onto the beaches and into the ocean. The problem is made worse by a lack of purified drinking water that forces its residents to drink bottled water. ""Indonesia has some of the highest marine life richness and biodiversity on Earth, and its coastal regions -- mangroves, coral reefs and their beaches -- are just awash in debris,"" said co-author Susan Williams, a professor with the UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory who has worked on projects in Indonesia for the past several years. ""You have the best and the worst situation right in front of you in Indonesia."" Meanwhile, the U.S. has highly advanced systems for collecting and recycling plastics. However, most Californians wash their clothing in washing machines, the water from which empties into more than 200 wastewater treatment plants offshore California. The authors theorize that fibers remaining in sewage effluent from washing machines were ingested by fish sampled in the state. ""To mitigate the issue in each location, it helps to think about local sources and differences in waste management strategies,"" Rochman said. It takes guts The scientists emphasize that the plastic and fibers are found in the fishes' guts. That means humans are likely to ingest the debris only if the fish is eaten whole, as it is in Indonesia, or such as with sardines and anchovies, rather than filleted. However, researchers are still studying whether chemicals in plastic can transfer into the meat.","Published: September 25, 2015"

ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Eventually, people with ALS lose the ability to initiate and control muscle movement, which often leads to total paralysis and death within two to five years of diagnosis. For unknown reasons, veterans are twice as likely to develop ALS as the general population. There is no cure, and only one drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) modestly extends survival. The Target ALS Postmortem Tissue Core is a unique resource in the field of ALS research, providing high-quality post-mortem tissue for academic and industry researchers throughout the world. The addition of whole genome sequencing to the clinical and pathological data collected on each individual will greatly expand the utility of this resource, providing researchers the ability to explore connections between genes, disease course, and tissue changes. The New York Genome Center is a world leader in whole genome sequencing for ALS and other diseases. Through its Consortium for Genomics of Neurodegenerative Disease, the Center harnesses state-of-the-art genetic, genomic, and bioinformatics tools to gain insights into motor neuron disease mechanisms, and uses this knowledge to identify new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to these devastating diseases. The ALS Association and its Greater New York Chapter committed an initial $2.5 million dollars towards a dedicated ALS program at the center. These funds matched a $2.5 million gift from The Tow Foundation in support of this initiative. ""We are very pleased to be able to combine whole genome sequencing with post-mortem tissue banking,"" said Association Chief Scientist Lucie Bruijn, Ph.D., M.B.A. ""This will give researchers the ability to ask and answer important questions that link gene-based mechanisms to their effects on tissues in people with ALS.

Certain diseases, including cancer, involves changes in DNA methylation patterns, and the ability to document these alterations aid in the development of novel therapies.  Methylation is really key in development, in disease, and in cancer,  says Whitehead Founding Member Rudolf Jaenisch, who is also a professor of biology at MIT.  This reporter is a very important tool. We believe it will allow us to look in a very detailed way at issues like imprinting during development and screening for the activation of genes silenced in diseases like cancer. This method will allow us to see which drug will activate a given gene.  An individual s cells rely on the same set of genes as instructions for protein production. The differences between a muscle cell and a brain cell are attributable to differences in gene expression; that is, which genes are turned on and off. DNA methylation the addition of methyl groups to the DNA is an epigenetic mechanism that controls gene expression. In most cases, methylated genes are switched off, while unmethylated genes are active.To date, scientists have only been able to study methylation in a population of cells by taking a  snapshot  of a few cells, a process that destroys the very cells under study. Because most cell populations in vivo are heterogeneous, and methylation can change over time, existing approaches have offered limited insight into this fundamental biological control. Creating a system that dynamically visualizes methylation at the level of a single cell intrigued Yonatan Stelzer, a postdoctoral researcher in Jaenisch s lab. Working with graduate student Chikdu Shivalila, Stelzer synthesized a DNA methylation reporter that mirrors whether a nearby region is methylated. When the target region is unmethylated, the reporter is also unmethylated, which allows expression of a glowing protein encoded by the reporter. This protein illuminates the cell. When the target is methylated, so too is the reporter, and the glowing protein remains unexpressed, leaving the cell unlit.  As the target region s methylation changes, so does the reporter s.  Pharmaceutical companies have been interested in manipulating methylation in disease,  says Stelzer.  Now that we have a reporter for methylation, they can screen for small molecules or genes that can change a cell s phenotype. For example, they could look for a drug that could change the hypermethylation that has been associated with a specific cancer.  Using the method, scientists should learn much more about methylation itself.  This opens up a whole new field of research,  says Shivalila.  You can use it to answer all of these questions about methylation that are completely unknown, including how methylation regulates gene transcription and expression patterns in cells. It s very exciting. ","Published: September 25, 2015"

By tweaking the genomes of these viruses, known as bacteriophages, researchers hope to customize them to target any type of pathogenic bacteria. To help achieve that goal, MIT biological engineers have devised a new mix-and-match system to genetically engineer viruses that target specific bacteria. This approach could generate new weapons against bacteria for which there are no effective antibiotics, says Timothy Lu, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and biological engineering.  These bacteriophages are designed in a way that s relatively modular. You can take genes and swap them in and out and get a functional phage that has new properties,  says Lu, the senior author of a paper describing this work. These bacteriophages could also be used to  edit  microbial communities, such as the population of bacteria living in the human gut. There are trillions of bacterial cells in the human digestive tract, and while many of these are beneficial, some can cause disease. For example, some reports have linked Crohn s disease to the presence of certain strains of E. coli. We d like to be able to remove specific members of the bacterial population and see what their function is in the microbiome,  Lu says.  In the longer term you could design a specific phage that kills that bug but doesn t kill the other ones, but more information about the microbiome is needed to effectively design such therapies.  The paper s lead author is Hiroki Ando, an MIT research scientist. Other authors are MIT research scientist Sebastien Lemire and Diana Pires, a research fellow at the University of Minho in Portugal. The Food and Drug Administration has approved a handful of bacteriophages for treating food products, but efforts to harness them for medical use have been hampered because isolating useful phages from soil or sewage can be a tedious, time-consuming process. Also, each family of bacteriophages can have a different genome organization and life cycle, making it difficult to engineer them and posing challenges for regulatory approval and clinical use. The MIT team set out to create a standardized genetic scaffold for their phages, which they could then customize by replacing the one to three genes that control the phages  bacterial targets. Many bacteriophages consist of a head region attached to a tail that enables them to latch onto their targets. The MIT team began with a phage from the T7 family that naturally kills Escherichia coli. By swapping in different genes for the tail fiber, they generated phages that target several types of bacteria.  You keep the majority of the phage the same and all you re changing is the tail region, which dictates what its target is,  Lu says. To find genes to swap in, the researchers combed through databases of phage genomes looking for sequences that appear to code for the key tail fiber section, known as gp17. After the researchers identified the genes they wanted to insert into their phage scaffold, they had to create a new system for performing the genetic engineering. Existing techniques for editing viral genomes are fairly laborious, so the researchers came up with an efficient approach in which they insert the phage genome into a yeast cell, where it exists as an  artificial chromosome  separate from the yeast cell s own genome. During this process the researchers can easily swap genes in and out of the phage genome.  Once we had that method, it allowed us very easily to identify the genes that code for the tails and engineer them or swap them in and out from other phages,  Lu says.  You can use the same engineering strategy over and over, so that simplifies that workflow in the lab.  The new approach also overcomes an important hurdle in using bacteriophages to treat disease, says David Bikard, a microbiologist at the Institut Pasteur in Paris.  Phages tend to infect only a very limited number of bacterial strains, which makes it difficult to choose the right phage for the right infection, if such a phage is available at all,  says Bikard, who was not involved in the research.  This is a big step in the development of phage therapies with predictable outcomes and a good demonstration of what synthetic biology approaches will bring to medicine in the near future.  A targeted strike In this study, the researchers engineered phages that can target pathogenic Yersinia and Klebsiella bacteria, as well as several strains of E. coli. These are all part of a group known as Gram-negative bacteria, against which there are few new antibiotics. This group also includes microbes that can cause respiratory, urinary, and gastrointestinal infections, including pneumonia, sepsis, gastritis, and Legionnaires  disease. One advantage of the engineered phages is that unlike many antibiotics, they are very specific in their targets.  Antibiotics can kill off a lot of the good flora in your gut,  Lu says.  We aim to create effective and narrow-spectrum methods for targeting pathogens.  Lu and his colleagues are now designing phages that can target other strains of harmful bacteria, which could have applications such as spraying on crops or disinfecting food, as well as treating human disease. Another advantage of this approach is that all of the phages are based on an identical genetic scaffold, which could streamline the process of getting regulatory approval, Lu says.","Published: September 25, 2015"

By not aiming to kill the pathogen with antibiotics, scientists were able to avoid wiping out sizeable numbers of beneficial gut microbes. And while their study was performed in mice, the drug used has already been tested in clinical trials to treat other, unrelated conditions. So the researchers believe it could be moved rapidly into human trials for the treatment of C. difficile, as well. The findings constitute the first-ever demonstration of a small molecule s ability to disarm C. difficile without incurring the collateral damage caused by antibiotics. C. difficile is responsible for more than 250,000 hospitalizations and 15,000 deaths per year in the United States, costing the country more than $4 billion in health-care expenses, said the study s senior author,Matthew Bogyo, PhD, professor of pathology and of microbiology and immunology. Lead authorship of the study is shared by Kristina Bender, PhD, a former postdoctoral scholar in Bogyo s lab, and Megan Garland, a student in the Medical Scientist Training Program.  Unlike antibiotics   which are both the front-line treatment for C. difficile infection and, paradoxically, possibly its chief cause   the drug didn t kill the bacteria,  Bogyo said. Instead, it disabled a toxin C. difficile produces, preventing intestinal damage and inflammation and allowing the gut to be repopulated by healthy bacteria that had been decimated by earlier rounds of antibiotic treatment, as well as by C. difficile-induced intestinal changes. Infection often recurs About one in 20 people, and possibly many more, harbor C. difficile in their gut, said study co-author Justin Sonnenburg, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology, who has conducted pioneering research on the trillions of microbes constituting our intestinal ecosystems. Usually, the pathogen causes no harm, he said. But in those with immune systems weakened by age, chemotherapy or antibiotics that wipe out their  lawn  of beneficial intestinal microbes, C. difficile can get a foothold and cause changes that damage the gut. Plus, the pathogen can dehydrate and condense into shrunken, long-lived spores, making it difficult to get rid of. Most C. difficile infections originate in settings such as hospitals, clinics and assisted-living facilities.  Making matters worse, in a quarter of patients who get it, the infection recurs despite antibiotic treatment. When it does, antibiotics succeed in eliminating it only 25 percent of the time. About 7 percent of infected people die within 30 days of diagnosis. Treatments for C. difficile infection include fecal transplants, which are often effective. But this treatment s long-term safety is difficult to ascertain, as a stool sample from any given donor contains its own mix of intestinal microbes, and some could have adverse effects on a recipient s health.  We don t have the tools to be able to screen for everything in a donor s stool,  said Sonnenburg, noting that gut bacteria have been implicated in obesity, as well as in neurological changes. Bogyo s group has extensive expertise in studying the activity of proteases, proteins capable of slicing up other proteins. A few years ago, co-author Aimee Shen, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in Bogyo s lab who is now an assistant professor at the University of Vermont, found that C. difficile s main toxins   secreted proteins known as Toxin A and Toxin B   contain nearly identical sections with protease activity. Moreover, she found, once the toxins are taken up by cells lining the mammalian gut, these sections become activated, setting in motion a chain of intracellular events that causes intestinal inflammation and tissue damage. This is a positive development for C. difficile, which thrives in the new environment it has created. But it s another story for myriad other bacterial species residing in the intestine   and disastrous for the infected individual s health, with symptoms ranging from severe diarrhea to intestinal lesions to death. Bogyo s team has developed ways of conducting high-throughput screens of small molecules to speedily test their ability to inhibit or enhance the activity of proteases. They put this technique to work in search of small molecules that specifically blocked the C. difficile toxins  protease activity. Helping the good guys  We figured that a molecule that interfered with the pathogen s virulence could prevent inflammation and the disruption of colon tissue without making the intestinal environment inhospitable to normal, beneficial bacteria the way antibiotics do,  said Bogyo. That would lay the groundwork for the  good guys  to make a comeback. In the first of a series of experiments, the investigators separately incubated each of 120,000 different small molecules with the protease-containing piece of C. difficile s primary toxin, Toxin B. Then, they added a toxin-activating factor and, using a test they d devised in which protease activity was signaled by fluorescence, looked for drugs that shut down that activity. They identified hundreds of such substances, including a number of compounds with known biological activity. Bogyo and his associates focused on a compound called ebselen because, in addition to having a strong inhibitory effect, ebselen also has been tested in clinical trials for chemotherapy-related hearing loss and for stroke. Preclinical testing provided evidence that ebselen is safe and tolerable, and it has shown no significant adverse effects in ensuing clinical trials. Bogyo s team conducted another test to see how ebselen affected human cells. They incubated the complete Toxin B molecule with the cells in the presence or absence of ebselen. When Toxin B was activated inside a cell, it induced internal damage that caused the cells to assume a rounded shape and die. Ebselen prevented that from happening. Realizing they might have a potentially effective drug on their hands, Bogyo and his colleagues brought in Sonnenburg, whose lab is adept at using mouse models of C. difficile infection. The researchers incubated Toxin B in a solution either containing or lacking ebselen and injected it into mice, then monitored the animals for three days. All of the mice injected with ebselen-pretreated toxin survived, while all of the mice that received the untreated toxin were dead within 48 hours. In a final set of studies, Bogyo and colleagues tested ebselen in a mouse model that more accurately mimics a clinical scenario in which high-risk individuals are treated prophylactically or at the first symptoms of recurrence. After rounds of multiple antibiotics, the researchers introduced a virulent, multi-drug-resistant C. difficile strain and then began oral dosing with ebselen. They observed a nearly complete block of inflammation and damage to colon tissue as the result of ebselen treatment. The upshot of this and other experiments conducted by Bogyo s team is that using ebselen to disable a toxin in C. difficile was enough to significantly reduce the clinical symptoms of the infection and block the persistent gut damage in mice. Bogyo said he hopes to move the drug rapidly into clinical trials for treating C. difficile infection.","Published: September 25, 2015"

They analyzed samples both pre- and post-transfusion and along with a variety of known viruses, they identified a new virus in two individuals. The virus was only present in post-transfusion samples, and additional tests showed that both patients were able to clear the virus. Genetic analysis determined that the virus was related to HCV and HPgV. Genomic testing of 70 additional individuals in the TTVS study failed to detect further cases of the virus.  The researchers also performed high-throughput sequencing on samples from 106 individuals in the Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study who received plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates. They identified the new virus in two individuals, one of whom had persistent long-term infection (5.4 years). ""We just don't know how many viruses are transmitted through the blood supply. There are so many viruses out there, and they need to be characterized in order to ensure that transfusions are safe,"" said Dr. Kapoor. He said the next steps are to determine the prevalence of the virus and whether it causes disease. If it causes disease, then screening the donor blood supply for the virus will be appropriate. ""Ultimately, once we know more about this, we will look for the presence of this virus in people with certain diseases,"" said Dr. Kapoor. ""The unusually high infection prevalence of HCV, HBV, and HIV in hemophilia patients and other transfusion recipients could have been prevented by earlier identification of these viruses and development of accurate diagnostic assays.""","Published: September 25, 2015"

A patent application has been filed and testing is underway on the protein   called HT-TALENs (short for HIV-targeted transcription activator-like effector nucleases)   which uses a newly developed gene-editing technique to rid the body s cells of the immunodeficiency virus before it has a chance to multiply and possibly develop into AIDS.  Humans infected with HIV have 1 million to 10 million cells harboring copies of HIV DNA. When HIV infects someone, the virus inserts itself into DNA cells and becomes part of those cells  permanent blueprint. Current drugs slow the virus from being produced, but they don t rid the body of the HIV DNA,  said NIPM executive director and UNLV professor Marty Schiller.  You ve got to get rid of or damage the harmful DNA to truly prevent the cells from creating the virus.  By altering a commonly used plant protein, Schiller s lab engineered the new HT-TALENs variation. Introduced into the body through a common cold virus injection, the protein adheres to the specific portions of DNA laden with HIV and acts as a pair of scissors that cuts or damages it without touching any of the non-infected DNA around it. When the cell repairs itself, the new copy won t contain functional HIV.  This is a way we re getting at the root cause of AIDS   not going after a downstream event, but going after the actual DNA copy   and hopefully stopping virus replication in its tracks,  Schiller said.  We think it has the potential to be a cure.  So far, the researchers have only produced results in petri dishes. They are awaiting patent approval and are gearing up to start on the next phase of testing this winter through a partnership with Brigham Young University. If that s successful, the scientists will move on to human trials. Time frame for market use? Schiller hates to speculate, but if all goes well the best-case scenario is seven years.  It s going to take a number of years to develop, but I m pretty sure this approach should work and our goal is to lead the way,  he said. The protein treatment s success would be a boon emotionally and financially for patients undergoing current HIV drug regimens, which can top $15,000 a year. Human tests would pair the new gene-editing protein therapy with current treatments. The protein might also be useful in curing other illnesses like bird flu. The approach is revolutionary, Schiller said, considering that genetics   now widely used for prenatal screening and drug development   seemed a mere fantasy when referenced in the 1993 film Jurassic Park. This project   one of about eight Schiller s lab is currently working on   began about three years ago after a weekly meeting of Schiller s team focused on current research papers. Schiller realized that the TALEN protein, derived from a wheat pathogen already widely used in the agriculture industry to genetically modify plants, described in one paper might be perfect after a few tweaks for use in HIV therapy.","Published: September 25, 2015"

Scientists have now discovered that the soft palate   the soft tissue at the back of the roof of the mouth   plays a key role in viruses  ability to travel through the air from one person to another. The findings should help scientists better understand how the flu virus evolves airborne transmissibility and assist them in monitoring the emergence of strains with potential to cause global outbreaks. Researchers from MIT and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) made the surprising finding while examining the H1N1 flu strain, which caused a 2009 pandemic that killed more than 250,000 people.MIT biological engineer Ram Sasisekharan, one of the study s senior authors, has previously shown that airborne transmissibility depends on whether a virus  hemagglutinin (HA) protein can bind to a specific type of receptor on the surface of human respiratory cells. Some flu viruses bind better to alpha 2-6 glycan receptors, which are found primarily in humans and other mammals, while other viruses are better adapted to alpha 2-3 glycan receptors, found predominantly in birds. The 2009 strain was very good at binding to human alpha 2-6 receptors. In the new study, the researchers made four mutations in the HA molecule of this virus, which made it better suited to bind alpha 2-3 receptors instead of alpha 2-6. They then used it to infect ferrets, which are often used to model human influenza infection. The researchers believed the mutated virus would not spread, but to their surprise, it traveled through the air just as well as the original version of the virus. After sequencing the virus  genetic material, they found that it had undergone a genetic reversion that allowed its HA protein to bind to alpha 2-6 glycan receptors as well as alpha 2-3 glycan receptors.  This is an experimental validation that gain of binding to the 2-6 glycan receptor is critical for aerosol transmission,  says Sasisekharan, the Alfred H. Caspary Professor of Biological Engineering and Health Sciences and Technology at MIT and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. Airborne evolution The researchers then examined tissue from different parts of the respiratory tract and found that viruses with the genetic reversion were most abundant in the soft palate. By three days after the initial infection, 90 percent of the viruses in this region had the reverted form of the virus. Other sites in the respiratory tract had a mix of the two types of virus. The researchers are now trying to figure out how this reversion occurs, and why it happens in the soft palate. They hypothesize that flu viruses with superior ability to transmit through the air outcompete other viruses in the soft palate, from which they can spread by packaging themselves into mucus droplets produced by cells in the soft palate known as goblet cells. Now that the researchers have confirmed that viruses with the ability to bind to both alpha 2-6 and alpha 2-3 glycan receptors can spread effectively among mammals, they can use that information to help identify viruses that may cause pandemics, Sasisekharan says.  It really provides us with a handle to very systematically look at any evolving pandemic viruses from the point of view of their ability to gain airborne transmissibility through binding to these 2-6 glycan receptors,  he says. The study opens up  a new frontier in our fight against future emergence of pandemic influenza viruses,  says Lin-Fa Wang, director of the program in emerging infectious disease at Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, who was not involved in the research.  Taken together, these new findings have significantly contributed to our understanding of key mechanisms involved in the switching from non-airborne transmissible viruses to those capable of doing so,  Wang says.  It will be interesting to see whether the current findings can be corroborated in human infections. ","Published: September 25, 2015"

George attracted the backing from angel investors with expertise in the medical device and healthcare industries, including leading patent attorneys, former CEOs and successful entrepreneurs in the field. Treatment with MediSieve s device involves no drugs or chemicals and offers new hope for malaria patients whose cases are severe or resistant to existing medicines. Pre-clinical trials show that the 3D printed magnetic blood filter could extract up to 90 per cent of infected cells from a person with malaria in under four hours. Speaking about the funding, George said:  With this investment, we re able to manufacture and test the first clinical prototype of the magnetic malaria filter for humans. This will put us in a fantastic position ahead of clinical trials. The backing also means MediSieve has experienced professionals in place to devise strategy and develop the business.  George is one of four runners-up for the Royal Academy of Engineering ERA Foundation Award and a member of the Academy s Enterprise Hub. Through the Hub, George received expert training on pitching to angel investors and structuring investment deals. He also received specialist tips from the Royal Society of Edinburgh, through the BBSRC Enterprise Fellowship Programme, and financial advisory firm Little Venice Partners. Ian Shott CBE FREng, serial entrepreneur who has held senior positions at biotech giant AstraZeneca and is Chair of the Academy s Enterprise Committee, said:  The aim of the Enterprise Hub is to get Britain s world-leading research innovations from lab to market by fostering long-term relationships between academia and industry. We empower researchers to commercialize their ideas by drawing on the expertise of the private sector. George has not only won significant financial backing, he has also secured a string of investors with a huge combined pool of expertise in the commercialization of healthcare technology. George s innovation has the capacity to transform lives across the developing world and we are delighted to have helped take this idea one step closer to market.  Red blood cells infected with a malaria parasite have magnetic properties. This enables MediSieve s device to capture them without affecting healthy cells. The process is similar to dialysis in that infected cells are captured as blood passes through an external loop. Rapid removal of infected cells has the potential to reduce symptoms, severity and mortality. This one off treatment could be used when drugs become ineffective or to supplement existing drug treatments. The magnetic device could help drug resistant patients manage malaria and keep symptoms at bay indefinitely. MediSieve s breakthrough comes at a time when scientists are increasingly concerned about drug resistant strains of malaria. Today, three of the five strains of the disease that affect humans can resist antimalarials - and they re spreading across Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar. Malaria is one of the world s most deadly diseases. Some 207 million cases are diagnosed every year, claiming 600,000 lives. For many people, the disease is untreatable, either because diagnosis is too late or the strain is resistant to drugs currently available.","Published: September 25, 2015"

Due to its high rate of lethality and pandemic potential, H7N9 vaccine development has become a priority for public health officials. However, candidate vaccines have failed to elicit the strong immune responses necessary to protect from infection. A study published in Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics has revealed that it may be due to immune camouflage. One of the ways by which the immune system detects infection is by presenting short peptides derived from the pathogen to T-cells, which distinguish between foreign and self antigens. The study shows that the H7N9 hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein has evolved a set of mutations that make it similar to human proteins, and the presented peptides thus resemble self antigens. The H7N9 influenza strain appears to effectively camouflage itself from the immune system. The immune-camouflage hypothesis was tested by challenging peripheral blood mononuclear cells from na ve donors with H7N9-derived peptides. Remarkably, the more the peptide resembled a self antigen, the less it was able to elicit a T-cell response. In addition, the predicted human-like antigens expanded and activated regulatory T-cells that are responsible for immune suppression when endogenous peptides are presented, providing further support for the hypothesis.  It appears that this new mechanism of immune escape may be common to quite a few human pathogens,  says Prof. De Groot.  We are working on validating several other peptides, some from common seasonal strains of influenza and some from pathogens like HIV and M. tuberculosis that do live for a long time inside their hosts.  H7N9 influenza has infected almost 670 people and led to 230 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These findings could facilitate the development of an effective vaccine and impact vaccine research in general.  It could well explain why some candidate vaccines for pathogens that have co-evolved with human beings   like TB and HIV   do not work so well. It also suggests that  tweaking  pathogen proteins to remove those camouflaging sequences would result in better, more effective vaccines,  concludes Prof. De Groot.  The original observation of low H7N9 T-cell epitope content was made before any data were available on vaccine efficacy,  says senior author Prof. Anne S. De Groot, Director of the Institute for Immunology and Informatics at the University of Rhode Island and CEO at EpiVax, Inc.  It turns out that we were absolutely correct. By comparison with H1N1 and H3N1, H7N9 vaccines are far less immunogenic.  Prof. De Groot s research team has developed a computational tool, JanusMatrix, capable of determining whether a given viral protein is similar to any human protein in residues relevant for antigen presentation.  JanusMatrix looks at both  faces  of T-cell epitopes. It starts by looking at the face that binds to HLA or MHC   the downward facing amino acids that bind into the MHC binding pockets. Having determined that a peptide can bind to a specific MHC, the program then looks at the T-cell receptor face (TCR face) and looks in a database of pre-parsed peptides from the human genome that have been identified as binding to the same MHC, for peptides that have the same TCR-facing amino acids.  It turns out that, in addition to having low T-cell epitope content, HA from H7N9, but not from other investigated influenza strains, shows high similarity to several endogenous proteins.","Published: September 25, 2015"

The products included in the Novartis Access product portfolio have been selected based on the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines List and are among the most commonly prescribed medicines in these countries. Novartis expects this new approach to be commercially sustainable over the long term, enabling continuous support in those regions. Each year, approximately 28 million people die from chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in low- and middle-income countries, representing 75% of deaths from NCDs globally. By 2025, the WHO projects that 75% of all deaths will be due to NCDs, mostly due to the rapid increase of NCDs in poverty-stricken areas. Novartis is launching Novartis Access to coincide with the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit 2015, where the new Sustainable Development Goals will be adopted. To more effectively address the rapid rise of chronic diseases in low- and low-middle-income countries, Novartis is actively seeking to partner with governments, NGOs and other public-sector organizations to strengthen healthcare systems. Areas of potential collaboration include programs to raise awareness about diseases, train healthcare workers to diagnose and treat chronic illnesses and strengthen medicine distribution systems.

Thanks to their discovery that specific antibodies play a key role in combating the viral infection, a vaccine against the disease ""progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy"" could now be developed. Humans carry a multitude of viruses and bacteria in their gut, on their skin and in other organs. Often, these are involved in important bodily functions. Under certain conditions, however, some can also cause diseases. The JC virus, a member of the polyoma tumor virus family, is a prime example. This pathogen was first isolated from the brain of a patient who was suffering from a rare brain disease known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The virus, which more than 60 percent of the global population are infected with, normally resides in the kidneys and certain other organs. JC virus can trigger the PML infection in the brain, which, in most cases, is fatal. Two studies conducted by an international team of researchers from the University of Zurich, the University Hospital Zurich, the National Institutes of Health in the US, San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, the University of T bingen, and the UZH spin-off Neurimmune now reveal that the antibodies in PML patients often fail to recognize the JC virus they are infected with. ""In healthy people, the disease never breaks out as the immune system keeps it well under control. Once the immune system is compromised, however, such as in patients with tumors, leukemia, AIDS, autoimmune diseases and certain immunosuppressive treatments, the JC virus is able to alter its genetic information and infect the brain,"" explains Roland Martin, professor of neurology at the University of Zurich. In multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, for instance, the treatment with a particular antibody, TysabriTM, prevents immune cells from reaching the brain -- but at the same time, also inhibits the brain's immunosurveillance. If JC viruses enter the brain during the treatment, they go undetected, which can cause PML, the most significant side effect of the highly effective Tysabri. Over 560 MS patients worldwide have already developed the PML brain infection. Over 20 percent of them died from the disease as there is no effective treatment to date. Only if the immune system function is completely restored can the JC virus be removed from the brain. The researchers now reveal potential ways to vaccinate against PML preventatively or, if the brain has already been infected, treat it with virus-specific human antibodies. By vaccinating mice and a PML patient with the virus' coating protein, the international groups were able to demonstrate that the antibody response was so strong that the patient was soon able to eliminate the JC virus. The so-called active vaccination method was developed at the University of Zurich and the University Hospital Zurich, and has already been used successfully on two more patients. The JC-virus-specific antibodies that are of interest for the treatment of the existing brain infection were developed by the group at the University of Zurich and the University Hospital Zurich together with colleagues from the University of T bingen and the biotechnology company Neurimmune in Schlieren. ""We made a major breakthrough,"" says Martin. We managed to isolate antibody-producing cells from a patient who survived PML and use them to produce neutralizing antibodies against the JC virus. These human antibodies have a major advantage: they recognize the most important mutants of the JC virus that can cause PML. They now make promising candidates for the development of a treatment for PML."" University of Zurich   press release Pastrana DV et al.

In new research, Brown University scientists report evidence that a particular part of the brain is responsible for exactly that function. This isn't just an everyday aspect of psychology; it's an every minute one. Think of your morning. When you hit the shower there was a sequence of things to do: wash here, then wash there, then shampoo, then maybe shave. Get dressed, pour coffee, grab keys, turn on the cell phone, remind the kids to take their backpacks, kiss your spouse. No one cued you about what to do next, but you remembered to get them all done. ""We're interested in the errors people make in everyday sequences of behavior,"" said co-author David Badre, associate professor of cognitive, linguistic, and psychological sciences. ""You have to internally monitor where you are and what you are doing."" What keeps you on track in these sequences of cognitive steps, Badre and his colleagues report the journal Neuron, appears to be a network of areas in the brain that includes the rostrolateral prefontal cortex (RLPFC), an area of neurons situated in the front of your brain. In the research, the team led by postdoctoral fellow Theresa Desrochers gave volunteers four-step sequences of tasks to work through. People had to note either the shape or color of a series of four images in different orders that they'd have to remember as they went along (e.g., shape, shape, color, color or shape, color, color, shape, etc.) Meanwhile the scientists including co-author Christopher Chatham used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the patterns of brain activity in the RLPFC and other regions as the volunteers did the task. The scientists also did experiments where they used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to briefly alter brain activity in various regions and at different times during the sequence to see how that affected the volunteers' error rate. What they found via fMRI was that the RLPFC increases its activity as people progress among the four steps in each new sequence. At the beginning of the next sequence, it drops down and then ramps up again as people move through the next four steps. The researchers hypothesized that this ramping could mirror the increasing uncertainty people would have about where they were in a sequence the farther they moved through it. But more tests were needed to determine whether the RLPFC is necessary to that process and what would happen if it were perturbed. TMS offers that opportunity. In its clinical application, psychiatrists use the technology to stimulate the brain repeatedly for a long time and over many sessions in order to treat symptoms of depression. For research it can produce very quick, small (and safe) electromagnetic stimulation that briefly and non-invasively elicits the neural activity of a precise region of the brain. ""This volley of neural activity is akin to static over a phone line, noise that other neurons listening in cannot interpret,"" Badre said. The team used that capability to find out what happens to sequential task performance when the RLPFC (and other control regions) are disrupted at different times during the task. The main findings of these experiments were that perturbing activity uniquely in the RLPFC led to rising error rates as the timing of the TMS pulse occurred later into the task sequences, mirroring the ramping dynamic observed in the fMRI experiment. With this evidence, here's what the researchers think is going on. With each step, the RLPFC has an increasing amount of uncertainty to resolve and the researchers see the ramp up in activity.

""We therefore get this increasing pattern of errors because there was more uncertainty to be dealt with.""

Scientists noted similarities between the two disorders more than thirty years ago. Now advances in brain imaging and associated techniques have enabled researchers to begin homing in on their structural and functional bases, revealing what appears to be a central gatekeeping system implicated in both chronic pain and tinnitus. Collaborators at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and Georgetown University Medical Center integrate the latest findings into a disease model of both disorders in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences. Tinnitus sufferers hear sounds that aren't there, usually described as a ringing or buzzing ""in the ears"" even though such perceptions clearly arise in the brain. Hearing loss is often associated with tinnitus but does not adequately account for it. Furthermore, not everyone with damaged cochlear nerves or cortical auditory circuits experiences tinnitus. One hypothesis suggests that the decisive factor is whether or not a higher-level cognitive system responsible for ""tuning out"" negative sensory signals is working normally. This view of tinnitus was hailed as a paradigm shift by people in the field when it was first proposed, in 2010, by Prof. Josef Rauschecker, Director of the Laboratory for Integrative Neuroscience and Cognition at Georgetown University and a Hans Fischer Senior Fellow of the TUM Institute for Advanced Study. Mounting evidence has strengthened the case, as improved techniques allow higher-resolution studies of changes in the brain. Close collaboration between Rauschecker's lab and PainLabMunich, led by TUM Prof. Markus Ploner, has extended this research into the common ground that tinnitus shares with chronic pain. And that common ground now has an address in the brain. Structural and functional changes in the same brain circuit -- including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens -- can open the gateway to both tinnitus and pain that persists long past any acute cause. The list of techniques that have contributed to this study is long and perhaps a bit esoteric-sounding, including functional magnetic resonance imaging, voxel-based morphometry, arterial spin labeling, positron emission tomography, and diffusion tensor imaging, as well as electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography. Results from these diverse approaches -- which essentially measure structural characteristics such as gray matter volume and functional properties such as network function -- have been correlated with and interpreted in the light of neurochemical studies. In their new paper Rauschecker and Ploner, together with postdoctoral researchers Audrey Maudoux (Georgetown) and Elisabeth May (TUM), present copious evidence that similar structures and functional systems are involved in tinnitus and chronic pain and probably play a central role in both. Significant loss of gray matter and compromised circuit function are observed in the suspected regions, with considerable overlap between neurological changes in tinnitus and chronic pain sufferers. All of these areas are also important for evaluating and modulating emotional experiences, Rauschecker says. ""These areas act as a central gatekeeping system for perceptual sensations, which determines the affective value of sensory stimuli -- whether produced externally or internally -- and modulates information flow in the brain. Tinnitus and chronic pain occur when this system is compromised."" The researchers propose that this newly identified gatekeeping system determines the relevance and affective value of sensory stimuli and controls information flow along pathways associated with the so-called executive functions. The process, they say, is controlled by two major neurotransmitters, dopamine and serotonin. Damage to this system, they argue, affects the perception of sensory signals in such a way that either tinnitus or chronic pain can develop and carry on in a self-perpetuating loop. They stress that there are still a number of open questions, particularly in relation to potential clinical interventions. Yet they see reason to be cautiously optimistic. Better understanding could lead to standardized assessment of individuals' risk to develop chronic tinnitus and chronic pain. This in turn might open the way for preventive action and early treatment, including for example cognitive-behavioral therapy, physiotherapy, and pharmacotherapy. ""However,"" Markus Ploner adds, ""better understanding might allow not only for early treatment, but also for more targeted and individual treatment with existing as well as novel strategies, such as dopaminergic therapy.""

Could their smiles have a purpose? In work published in PLoS ONE, a team of computer scientists, roboticists and developmental psychologists confirm what most parents already suspect: when babies smile, they do so with a purpose to make the person they interact with smile in return. In addition, babies reach that goal by using sophisticated timing, much like comedians who time their jokes to maximize audience response. But there is a twist: babies seem to be doing this while smiling as little as possible. Researchers detail their findings in an innovative study that combines developmental psychology, computer science and robotics an approach that has never been tried before, to the best of the researchers  knowledge. The study is part of an effort funded by the National Science Foundation to use robots to better understand human development. It gives developmental psychologists a tool for studying non-verbal children and adults, such as those with autism, researchers said. To verify their findings, researchers programmed a toddler-like robot to behave like the babies they studied and had the robot interact with undergraduate students. They obtained the same results: the robot got the undergraduates to smile as much as possible, while smiling as little as possible.  If you ve ever interacted with babies, you suspect that they re up to something when they re smiling. They re not just smiling randomly,  said Javier Movellan, a research scientist in the Machine Perception Laboratory at the University of California (UC), San Diego, and one of the study s authors.  But proving this is difficult.  To find out what babies are really up to, researchers turned to optimal control theory, a tool often used in robotics. The method allows researchers to design and program robots to perform a specific behavior based on specific goals. In this study, the researchers used the method to reverse engineer what the babies  goals were based on their behavior. Researchers used data from a previous study that observed the face to face interactions of 13 pairs of mothers and infants under the age of four months, including when and how often the mothers and babies smiled. After running the data through their reverse-control theory algorithms, researchers were actually surprised by the findings, said Paul Ruvolo, a professor at Olin College of Engineering and an alumnus of the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego.  We thought either the babies had no goal or it was about mutual smiling,  he said. Researchers are careful to point out that they can t determine if the babies are conscious of what they re doing.  We are not claiming that a particular cognitive mechanism, for instance conscious deliberation, is responsible for the observed behaviors. Our methods are agnostic to this question.  Ruvolo said. Even though the sample size was small, the findings were statistically strong, said Movellan. The control theory data analysis found that 11 out of the 13 babies in the study showed clear signs of intentional smiling. Movellan and his team have been working for several years to program a realistic humanoid robot.  Our goal was to have human development inform the development of social robots,  said Ruvolo. So the researchers developed a program that mimicked the babies  actions and transferred it onto Diego San, a toddler-like robot that Movellan s team had used for similar studies in the past. Diego San interacted with 32 UC San Diego undergraduates individually during three-minute sessions where it displayed one of four different behaviors. For example, the robot was programmed to smile back every time the undergraduates smiled a big favorite with the study s subjects. When Diego San behaved like the babies in the study, the undergraduate students behaved like the babies  mothers: they smiled a lot even while the robot didn t have to smile that much. Study co-author Dan Messinger from the University of Miami, received a grant to model babies  responses to brief pauses in interaction based on the study s data.  What makes our study unique is that previous approaches to studying infant-parent interaction essentially describe patterns,  said Messinger.  But we couldn t say what the mother or infant is trying to obtain in the interaction. Here we find that infants have their own goals in the interaction, even before four months of age.  Movellan will present a demonstration of related work Oct. 30 at the Contextual Robotics Forum at the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego.

Yet unexpectedly, scientists at the Institut de Neurosciences Cognitives et Int gratives d'Aquitaine (INCIA, CNRS/Universit  de Bordeaux) have discovered that a brain region located in the thalamus also plays a crucial role in using these evolved skills. Tested in the rat, this work is published in the Journal of Neuroscience. All living organisms must take appropriate decisions to meet their own needs. In particular, the ability to take account of abrupt environmental changes represents a significant challenge for the survival of a species. Such decision-making is considered as an evolved cognitive function. It involves the orbitofrontal cortex, one of the most developed brain structures, known to perform decision-making processes. The ""D cision et Adaptation"" team at the INCIA first of all focused on the brain regions connected to the orbitofrontal cortex. Using a labeling technique, the scientists evidenced a specific area, the thalamic submedius nucleus, which is closely linked to the orbitofrontal cortex and whose functional role is unknown. The team then tested the role of these two brain structures (the submedius thalamic nucleus and orbitofrontal cortex) in decision-making and adaptive behavior. To achieve this, they studied three groups of rats: the first presented lesions to the orbitofrontal cortex, the second had lesions on the submedius nucleus and the third was made up of lesion-free control animals. The objective was to test their ability to establish a link between an auditory cue and obtaining a food reward. The experiment was organized in two phases. The initial learning phase allowed the animals to learn that two different sounds (S1 and S2) each signaled a specific food reward. The three groups of animals thus visited the food dispenser as soon as an auditory stimulus was perceived. The lesions did not prevent the animals from learning that an auditory stimulus predicts a reward. During the second phase, the procedure remained unchanged for the first cue, but for S2, the scientists distributed food rewards during, and mostly outside, cue test periods. This sound thus lost its predictive value and lesion-free animals started to take no account of the S2 auditory stimulus, only visiting the dispenser when they heard S1. On the other hand, animals with a lesion -- of either the orbitofrontal cortex or the submedius thalamic nucleus -- proved incapable of making this distinction, and thus of adapting. This study therefore identified the existence of a circuit between the thalamus and the cortex, which proved crucial to adaptive decision-making. The originality of this discovery lies in the key role that scientists attribute to the submedius thalamic nucleus, a structure hitherto poorly known in the field of adaptive behavior. These findings suggest that numerous functional circuits underlying this type of behavior may involve a contribution from the thalamus. The team is now planning to explore these ""thalamocortical"" circuits, whose understanding could shed light on numerous diseases, such as schizophrenia or addiction.

The companies initially focused efforts on lung diseases and will now also include kidney diseases. As part of the agreement, SGI will receive royalties and milestones from the development and commercialization of the organs. SGI is also announcing an additional $50 million equity investment by Lung Biotechnology.  Financial details were not disclosed.  Lung Biotechnology previously invested $50 million in SGI preferred stock in April, 2014.  We are excited to expand our collaboration with United Therapeutics with the goal to provide organs to patients in high need,  said Oliver S. Fetzer, Ph.D., CEO of SGI.  The progress on the program to date using SGI s proprietary cell engineering technology has enhanced our confidence and will now be expanded to an additional transplantable organ.  We look forward to deepening the collaboration with our partner United Therapeutics and to combine our expertise to help these patients.  United Therapeutics Chairman and Co-CEO Martine Rothblatt, Ph.D. added,  Our expanded collaboration with Synthetic Genomics is significant for applying our growing xenotransplantation science platform to the problem of end-stage renal failure.  Our combined expertise will accelerate our efforts to develop an expanded supply of transplantable kidneys, potentially helping tens of thousands of patients suffering from incurable kidney disease.  Using unique DNA design, DNA synthesis and genome editing, as well as genome modification tools, SGI will develop engineered primary pig cells with modified genomes. This work will entail modification of a substantial number of genes at an unprecedented scale and efficiency.  United Therapeutics will leverage its xenotransplantation expertise to implant these engineered cells, generating pig embryos which develop and are born with transplantable organs. With the science and technology advances made by the SGI team over the last years, the companies are striving to develop these new methods and advances to create organs that are safe and effective for use in humans.  Treatments for kidney failure include dialysis and transplantation, and there were more than 600,000 people with end-stage kidney disease under treatment in the United States during 2012.  More than 50,000 people are added to the kidney transplant wait list each year with more than 100,000 total awaiting a kidney transplant in the United States. The tremendous shortfall of donor organs, results in only about 17,000 United States kidney transplants annually.   Previous attempts to rectify this shortage with animal organs have failed due to genomic incompatibilities, especially with respect to immune and coagulation systems. The collaboration between Synthetic Genomics and Lung Biotechnology aims to eliminate these genomic incompatibilities.","Published: September 24, 2015"

I m grateful to the Gates Foundation for its strong support of our research and for its continued commitment to eradicating HIV/AIDS throughout the world,  Farzan said. Farzan brings an innovative approach to combating HIV. The approach works by coaxing muscle cells into producing inhibitor proteins that block key sites on the virus s surface used to attach and invade human immune cells fooling the virus into thinking it is binding to a human cell. Unable to attach to cells, and unable to reproduce, the virus simply floats impotently in the blood stream. Farzan and colleagues  breakthrough research received worldwide attention when announced earlier this year in the journal Nature. When the drug candidate, called eCD4-lg, was tested in the laboratory and in animal models, the results were so powerful and universally effective that they suggested the compound s potential to serve the role of an alternative HIV/AIDS vaccine. The drug candidate offered complete protection of animal models against the virus for up to one year.  Our compound eCD4-Ig is the broadest and most potent entry inhibitor described so far, effective against all strains tested,  Farzan said.  At the end of our research, we expect to have enough evidence to develop a firm foundation to fully evaluate its potential as an alternative vaccine.

Led by Marion Emmert, PhD, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at WPI, the research program involves early-stage technology developed in her lab that may yield a more efficient and predictable method of bonding a vital class of structures called aromatic and benzylic amines to a drug molecule. ""Seven of the top 10 pharmaceuticals in use today have these substructures, because they are so effective at creating a biologically active compound,"" Emmert said. ""The current processes used to add these groups are indirect and not very efficient. So we asked ourselves, can we do it better? ""For a drug to do its job in the body it must interact with a specific biological target and produce a therapeutic effect. First, the drug needs to physically attach or ""bind"" to the target, which is a specific part of a cell, protein, or molecule. As a result, designing a new drug is like crafting a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle piece that fits precisely into an existing biological structure in the body. Aromatic and benzylic amines add properties to the drug that help it bind more efficiently to these biological structures. Getting those aromatic and benzylic amines into the structure of a drug, however, is difficult. Traditionally, this requires a specialized chemical bond as precursor in a specific location of the drug's molecular structure. ""The current approach to making those bonds is indirect, requires several lengthy steps, and the outcome is not always precise or efficient,"" Emmert said. ""Only a small percentage of the bonds can be made in the proper place, and sometimes none at all."" Emmert's new approach uses novel reagents and metal catalysts to create a process that can attach amines directly, in the right place, every time. In early proof-of-principle experiments, Emmert has succeeded in making several amine bonds directly in one or two days, whereas the standard process can take two weeks with less accuracy. Over the next three years, with support from the NIH, Emmert's team will continue to study the new catalytic processes in detail. They will also use the new process to synthesize Asacol, a common drug now in use for ulcerative colitis, and expect to significantly shorten its production. ""Some of our early data are promising, but we have a lot more work to do to understand the basic mechanisms involved in the new processes,"" Emmert said. ""We also have to adapt the process to molecules that could be used directly for drug development.""","Published: September 24, 2015"

The findings, published in Nature, provide a significant advance toward understanding the microenvironment in which stem cells reside within the bone marrow.  The bone marrow and blood-forming stem cells are like a haystack with needles inside. Researchers in the past have been able to find a few stem cells, but they ve only seen a small percentage of the stem cells that are there, so there has been some controversy about where exactly they re located,  said Dr. Sean Morrison, CRI Director and Mary McDermott Cook Chair in Pediatric Genetics at UT Southwestern Medical Center.  We developed a technique that allows us to digitally reconstruct the entire haystack and see all the needles - all the blood-forming stem cells that are present in the bone marrow - and to know exactly where they are and how far they are from every other cell type.  The CRI team began by identifying a genetic marker that is almost exclusively expressed in blood-forming stem cells. They took green fluorescent protein from jellyfish and inserted it into the genetic marker to be able to visually identify the stem cells. The fluorescent protein makes the stem cells glow green within the bone marrow.  Using a tissue-clearing technique that makes the bone and bone marrow see-through, and employing a high-resolution, confocal microscope to scan the entire bone marrow compartment, we were able to image large segments of bone marrow to locate every blood-forming stem cell and its relation to other cells,  said Dr. Melih Acar, an Assistant Instructor at CRI and the paper s first author. The team s work yielded new findings and confirmed others: blood-forming stem cells tend to be clustered in the center of the bone marrow, not closer to bone surfaces as some had previously thought; blood-forming stem cells are indeed associated with sinusoidal blood vessels; and there are no spatially distinct niches for dividing and non-dividing blood-forming stem cells.  With this improved understanding of the microenvironment and mechanisms that maintain blood-forming stem cells, we are closer to being able to replicate the environment for blood-forming stem cells in culture,  said Dr. Morrison, who is also a Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) Scholar in Cancer Research and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator.  That achievement would significantly improve the safety and effectiveness of bone marrow transplants and potentially save thousands of additional lives each year. ","Published: September 24, 2015"

Their findings may aid efforts to build point-of-care devices for quick medical diagnosis of various diseases ranging from cancer, allergies, autoimmune diseases, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and many others. The new technology may also drastically impact global health, due to its low cost and easiness of use, according to the research team. The rapid and easy-to-use diagnostic tests are made of DNA and use one of the simplest force in chemistry, steric effects - a repulsion force that arises when atoms are brought too close together - to detect a wide array of protein markers that are linked to various diseases. The design was created by the research group of Alexis Vall e-B lisle, a professor in the Department of Chemistry at University of Montreal. ""Despite the power of current diagnostic tests, a significant limitation is that they still require complex laboratory procedures. Patients typically must wait for days or even weeks to receive the results of their blood tests,"" Vall e-B lisle said. ""The blood sample has to be transported to a centralised lab, its content analyzed by trained personnel, and the results sent back to the doctor's office. If we can move testing to the point of care, or even at home, it would eliminates the lag time between testing and treatment, which would enhance the effectiveness of medical interventions.The key breakthrough underlying this new technology came by chance. ""While working on the first generation of these DNA-base tests, we realised that proteins, despite their small size (typically 1000 times smaller than a human hair) are big enough to run into each other and create steric effect (or traffic) at the surface of a sensor, which drastically reduced the signal of our tests,"" said Sahar Mashid, postdoctoral scholar at the University of Montreal and first author of the study. ""Instead of having to fight this basic repulsion effect, we instead decided to embrace this force and build a novel signaling mechanism, which detects steric effects when a protein marker binds to the DNA test."" The sensing principle is straightforward: the diagnostically relevant protein (green or red), if present, binds to an electro-active DNA strand, and limits the ability of this DNA to hybridize to its complementary strand located on the surface of a gold electrode. Francesco Ricci, a professor at University of Rome Tor Vergata who also participated in this study, explains that this novel signaling mechanism produces sufficient change in current to be measured using inexpensive electronics similar to those in the home glucose test meter used by diabetics to check their blood sugar. Using this DNA-base assay, the researchers were able to detect multiple protein markers directly in whole blood in fewer than 10 minutes, even if their concentration is 1,000 000 times less concentrated than glucose. ""A great advantage of this DNA-based electrochemical test is that its sensing principle can be generalized to many different targets, allowing us to build inexpensive devices that could detect dozens of disease markers in less than five minutes in the doctor's office or even at home,"" concludes Vall e-B lisle. A patent has been submitted for this invention, and many other applications are envisaged, including pathogen detection in food or water and therapeutic drug monitoring at home, a feature which could drastically improve the efficient of various class of drugs and treatments.","Published: September 24, 2015"

The human body is made up of tens of trillions of cells. Each cell contains thousands of proteins, which determine how the cell should form and what functions it needs to perform. Proteins, in turn, are made up of hundreds of amino acids. The blueprint for each protein is specified by genetic codons, which are triplets of nucleotides that can make 20 different types of amino acids. The way in which amino acids are linked together then determines which proteins are eventually produced, and in turn, what functions the cell will have. What researchers found was that not only does the sequence of the amino acids matter, but so does the speed of the process in which the amino acids are put together into a functional protein.  Our results uncovered a new  code  within the genetic code. We feel this is quite important, as the finding uncovers an important regulatory process that impacts all biology,  said Dr. Yi Liu, Professor of Physiology. It was long known that almost every amino acid can be encoded by multiple synonymous codons and that every organism, from humans to fungi, has a preference for certain codons. The researchers found that more frequently used codons   the  preferred codons    speed up the process of producing an amino acid chain, while less frequently produced codons slow the process. The use of either preferred or non-preferred codons is like having speed signs on the protein production highway: some segments need to be made fast and others slow.  The genetic code of nucleic acids is central to life, as it specifies the amino acid sequences of proteins,  said Dr. Liu, the Louise W. Kahn Scholar in Biomedical Research.  By influencing the speed with which a protein is assembled from amino acid building blocks, the use of  fast  and  slow  codons can affect protein folding, which is the process that allows a protein to form the right shape to perform a specific function. This speed control mechanism makes sure that proteins are assembled and folded properly in different cells. Therefore, the genetic code not only specifies the sequence of amino acids but also the shape of the protein.  The researchers found that proteins with identical amino acid sequences can have different functions if they are assembled at different speeds. This can have important implications for identifying human disease-causing mutations because this study indicates that a mutation does not have to change amino acid identity to cause a disease. In fact, most mutations in human DNA do not result in amino acid change.  Therefore, our study indicates that the new  code    the speed limit of assembly   within the genetic code can dictate the ultimate function of a given protein,  said Dr. Liu. The findings appear as the cover story of the journal Molecular Cell, one of the top molecular biology, biophysics, and biochemistry journals. The latest findings extend prior research published by Dr. Liu and colleagues in Nature in 2013 that broke new ground by demonstrating that synonymous codons of a circadian clock protein are not the same in making functional proteins, despite the fact that they encode the same amino acids. Genes can adapt to different environmental changes by choosing the most optimal codon, which is counterintuitive to natural selection. Dr. Liu and his team are able to study these systems using a type of bread mold fungus called Neurospora crassa. The use of the mold allows for easy manipulation of its genes and codons in the laboratory that are more difficult to do in animals.

The drug works its euphoric effect by acting on a specific protein that has been part of vertebrate anatomy for nearly a half-billion years. Despite that lengthy pedigree, regulation of these receptor proteins has never been well understood. A new study led by Kirill Martemyanov, an associate professor on the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), has shown that a specific molecule controls morphine receptor signaling in a small group of brain cells. The findings could lead to a new drug target for developing less-addictive pain medications and even offer a clue to the genetic predisposition of patients to addiction before treatment.The molecule in question is known as a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) protein, which controls the morphine receptor (mu opioid receptor). Using genetically modified animal models lacking a particular RGS protein called RGS7, a protein abundant in the brain, the study showed that eliminating the protein enhanced reward, increased pain relief, delayed tolerance and heightened withdrawal in response to self-administered morphine doses. In other words, without the protein, the animals were predisposed to morphine addiction. ""The mu opioid receptor acts as a conductor of the drug's effects, while RGS7 acts as a brake on the signal,"" Martemyanov said. ""The animals could press a lever to receive an infusion of morphine. We looked at the number of lever presses to determine how much they liked it and, judging from this test, mice lacking RGS7 craved the drug much more than their normal siblings."" RGS7 appears to exert its effects by regulating morphine-induced changes in excitability of neurons and plasticity of synapses--the ability of the synapse, the junction between two nerve cells, to change its function. ""This study reveals a unique modulatory role of RGS7 in a brain-region-specific action to morphine use and indicates RGS7 as a potential drug target,"" said Research Associate Laurie P. Sutton, the first author of the study. ""Pharmacological intervention at the level of RGS7 may reduce some of the detrimental side-effects associated with opiates."" Martemyanov believes there is a strong diagnostic future for their discovery. ""If our findings hold true for human patients, you could look specifically for RGS7 levels for any disabling mutation with a simple blood test,"" he said. ""Mutations could indicate a strong reaction to a drug such as morphine--people carrying a deficient copy of the RGS7 gene might need much lower doses of opioids and could be cautioned to be extra careful with these substances."" This might also shed light on why some people have such a difficult time with addiction to drugs such as morphine, while others are not so susceptible, Martemyanov noted. Surprisingly, in addition to drug craving, the animals lacking RGS7 also worked harder to obtain a food reward, further suggesting that RGS7 may be a more general regulator of reward behavior extending beyond drug-induced euphoria.","Published: September 24, 2015"

The drugs, which affect the structure and function of the cancer cell s DNA rather than the activity of its proteins, also slowed the growth of human lung cancer cells in mice. The study clarifies the potential of these types of drugs for treating diseases. The researchers hope to soon test the drug combination in humans with pancreatic cancer.  Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly of all human cancers, and its incidence is increasing,  said Julien Sage, PhD, associate professor of pediatrics and of genetics.  Nearly always the cause of the disease seems to be a mutation in a gene called KRAS, which makes a protein that is essential for many cellular functions. Although this protein, and others that work with it in the Ras pathway, would appear to be a perfect target for therapy, drugs that block their effect often have severe side effects that limit their effectiveness. So we decided to investigate drugs that affect the DNA rather than the proteins.  Sage shares senior authorship of the study with Jens Siveke, MD, professor of medicine at the Technical University of Munich. Stanford postdoctoral scholar Pawel Mazur, PhD, shares lead authorship with postdoctoral scholar Alexander Herner, MD, of TUM. Usually, most DNA in a cell is tightly wound around special packaging proteins called histones, like thread on a spool. In this state, the genes on the DNA are inaccessible to a cell s protein-making machinery. But chemical tags called acetyl groups induce histones to relax their grip and allow access to the DNA; to permit gene expression, the cell carefully coordinates the addition and removal of these tags to histones. This expression is facilitated by special proteins that can read a histone s acetyl status. This kind of modification of DNA-associated proteins, as well as of other tags on the DNA itself, helps a cell produce the right proteins at the right times in development and allows it to respond nimbly to its environment. These dynamic modifications are called epigenetics, and it s been shown to be increasingly important in many disease processes. Tinkering with cell s epigenetics Mazur and Herner wondered whether tinkering with a cell s epigenetics could control the growth and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells without causing many of the deleterious side effects seen by drugs that inhibit protein members of the Ras pathway, a cellular signaling cascade that controls cell growth, development and survival.  They started by investigating the effect of a small molecule they called JQ1 on the growth of human pancreatic tumor cells in a laboratory dish. JQ1 inhibits a family of proteins responsible for sensing acetyl groups on histones. The researchers found that the cells treated with JQ1 grew more slowly and displayed fewer cancerous traits. The molecule was also able to significantly shrink established pancreatic tumors in mice with the disease. However, it did not significantly affect the animals  overall likelihood of survival. When the researchers investigated the effect of JQ1 treatment more thoroughly, they found that it inhibited the expression of a gene called Myc, which is known to be associated with many types of cancers, including pancreatic cancer. It also decreased the levels of inflammatory molecules known to be involved in the development of pancreatic cancer.    The effect of JQ1 treatment was OK, but not amazing,  said Sage, who is also a member of the Stanford Cancer Institute.  So Pawel had the idea to look for drug combinations that might have a synergistic effect.  Mazur tried eight drugs in combination with JQ1, each targeting either a known cancer-associated pathway or a step involved in epigenetics.  Strong synergistic effect   It happened that the drug that worked best was another epigenetic drug called vorinostat,  said Sage.  On its own, vorinostat didn t work very well, but when combined with JQ1 it showed a very strong synergistic effect in both the laboratory mice with pancreatic cancer and in pancreatic cancer cells from people with the disease.  Vorinostat works by inhibiting a family of proteins that remove the acetyl groups from histones. It has been approved by the FDA for use in people with recurrent or difficult-to-treat cutaneous T cell lymphoma. When human pancreatic cancer cells were treated simultaneously with JQ1 and vorinostat, the cells grew more slowly and were more likely to die. Mice with established pancreatic cancers treated with both of the drugs showed a marked reduction in tumor size and a significant increase in overall survival time. Their tumors showed no signs of developing a resistance to the treatment, and the mice did not develop any noticeable side effects. Finally, Mazur tested the effect of the combination treatment on a type of lung cancer that, like pancreatic cancer, is driven by mutations in KRAS. He found that together JQ1 and vorinostat also significantly increased the survival of mice with this cancer, called lung adenocarcinoma. The researchers are now working to learn more about how JQ1 and vorinostat synergize on a molecular level. Mazur found that the combination treatment led to a significant increase in the production of a protein called p57 in the cancer cells. P57, also known as Kip2, blocks cells from dividing. Mutations in p57 have been implicated in cancer development in humans. He then used a unique genome-editing technique called CRISPR to eliminate the expression of p57 in the pancreas of an adult mouse and showed that, in its absence, treatment with JQ1 and vorinostat was much less successful at inducing cell death. Mazur and Sage said they hope this newly identified combination treatment can be tested in the clinic within the next five years. The fact that vorinostat is already approved for use in humans may speed the process, they believe. They re also interested in learning whether the treatment may be effective in other types of conditions.  We don t know yet whether this synergistic effect is specific to cancers driven by mutations in KRAS or if it could also work on other types of cancers,  Sage said.","Published: September 24, 2015"

DNA sequencing is a technique that can determine exact sequence of a DNA molecule. One of the most critical biological and medical tools available today, it lies at the core of genome analysis. Reading the exact make-up of genes, scientists can detect mutations, or even identify different organisms. A powerful DNA sequencing method uses tiny, nano-sized pores that read DNA as it passes through. However,  nanopore sequencing  is prone to high inaccuracy because DNA usually passes through very fast. EPFL scientists have now discovered a viscous liquid that slows down the process up to a thousand times, vastly improving the method s resolution and accuracy. Reading too fast DNA is a long molecule made up of four repeating different building-blocks. These are called  nucleotides  and are strung together in various combinations that contain the cell s genetic information, such as genes. Essentially, the four nucleotides compose all genetic language. DNA sequencing seeks to decipher this language, breaking it back down to individual letters. In nanopore sequencing, DNA passes through a tiny pore in a membrane, much like a thread goes through a needle. The pore also contains an electrical current. As each of the four nucleotides pass through the pore, they block the current in individual ways that can be used to identify them. Though powerful, the method suffers from high speed: DNA goes through the pore too quickly to be read with enough accuracy. Slowing things down The lab of Aleksandra Radenovic at EPFL s Institute of Bioengineering has now overcome the problem of speed by using a thick, viscous liquid that slows the passage of DNA two to three orders of magnitude. As a result, sequencing accuracy improves down to single nucleotides. The research was carried out by Jiandong Feng and Ke Liu, working with colleagues in Andras Kis s lab at EPFL. The two researchers developed a film made of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), only 0.7 nm in thickness. This is already an innovation over attempts in the field that use graphene: DNA is a fairly sticky molecule and MoS2 is considerably less adhesive than graphene. The team then created a nanopore on membrane, almost 3 nm wide. The next step was to dissolve DNA in a thick liquid that contained charged ions and whose molecular structure can be fine-tuned to change its thickness, or  viscosity gradient . The liquid belongs to the class of  room-temperature ionic liquids , which are basically salts dissolved in a solution. The EPFL scientists exploited the liquid s tunability to bring it to an ideal viscosity gradient   enough to slow down DNA. Finally, the team tested their system by passing known nucleotides, dissolved in the liquid, through the nanopore multiple times. This allowed them to take an average reading for each one of the four nucleotides, which can be used to identify them later on. Although still at a testing stage, the team is aiming to continue their work by testing entire DNA strands.  We are seeking opportunities to commercialize this technique, which is promising for sequencing with solid-state nanopores,  says Jiandong Feng. The scientists also predict that using high-end electronics and control of the viscosity gradient of the liquid could further optimize the system. By combining ionic liquids with nanopores on molybdenum disulfide thin films, they hope to create a cheaper DNA sequencing platform with a better output. The work offers an innovative way that can improve one of the best DNA sequencing methods available.  In years to come, sequencing technology will definitely shift from research to clinics,  says Aleksandra Radenovic.  For that, we need rapid and affordable DNA sequencing   and nanopore technology can deliver. ","Published: September 24, 2015"

Now exciting new research from the University of Virginia School of Medicine and the University of Colorado demonstrates the effectiveness of a third strategy: adjusting the landscape of the human body to remove the mechanism that allows pathogens to cause disease.  The researchers have silenced genes within human cells to induce immunity to the parasite E. histolytica, which infects 50 million people and causes 40,000 to 110,000 deaths worldwide each year via severe diarrhea.  This amoeba is a cluster bomb   a voracious killer,  said U.Va. s Chelsea Marie, a research scientist in infectious diseases and international health, noting the challenge the researchers faced in blocking the amoeba s ability to kill human cells.  In the back of my mind, I was thinking the parasite was going to decimate the host cells no matter what we did with their genetics.  The research group used a technique called RNAi to create a library of bladder cancer cells with thousands of independent, silenced genes. Then they challenged these cultures with E. histolytica.  We do this all the time in cancer research,  said Dr. Dan Theodorescu, formerly of U.Va. and now director of the University of Colorado Cancer Center.  Commonly, we re looking for genes that, when silenced, will make cells more susceptible to chemotherapy.  In this case, the analogue of chemotherapy was the infectious, dangerous pathogen. E. histolytica proved a stubborn foe, decimating many thousands of the manipulated cell cultures. However, a small number of cells seemed to resist the parasite. Was this the random chance of lucky survival, or had silenced genes somehow provided immunity? To find out, Marie discarded the dead cells and retested the survivors; again she infected the cells with E. histolytica.  It wasn t a fluke,  she said.  We did this over nine generations of cells, each time selecting the cells that survived and then re-applying the parasite. Over these generations of selection, we saw the cultures becoming more and more enriched for cells lacking specific genes.  Using next-generation sequencing, Marie identified the genes that conferred resistance and found that many were involved in managing the flow of potassium into and out of human cells. A follow-up experiment showed that, left unimpeded, E. histolytica caused intestinal cells to pump out potassium directly before cell death.  We started to see a pretty clear line of reasoning,  Theodorescu said.  The parasite was causing potassium efflux right before cell death, and cells that happened to be unable to transport potassium didn t die.   There is a clear need for new drugs targeting E. histolytica,  said Marie s mentor, Dr. William A. Petri Jr., chief of U.Va. sDivision of Infectious Diseases and International Health.  Right now there is a single antibiotic that works against this parasite. We know that eventually the parasite will develop resistance to the antibiotic, and at that point there s no plan B. This could be the plan B   targeting the human genes that enable the parasite to cause disease.  Marie is pushing forward, working to make the technique used in the study more efficient and move it toward use in humans. But just demonstrating it can work is a huge accomplishment.  This is a major finding with translational implications for this infection that causes so many deaths worldwide, but also proof that this cancer-science approach can be used to explore genetic mechanisms of resistance in the field of infectious disease,  Theodorescu said.","Published: September 24, 2015"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-cell-type-may-help-explain-dangerous-food-allergies-202406,New Cell Type May Help Explain Dangerous Food Allergies Researchers have discovered a new cell type that appears to drive life threatening food allergies and may help explain why some people get severe allergic reactions and others do not   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Scientists at Cincinnati Children s Hospital Medical Center say their findings in mice should also provide insights into new therapeutic strategies and diagnostics for food allergies and anaphylactic shock triggered by the immune antibody IgE (immunoglobulin E). The authors report discovery of what they call  IL-9-producing mucosal mast cells  or (MMC9 cells). The cells produce large amounts of an inflammatory immune protein called interlukin 9 (IL-9), which amplifies anaphylactic shock in response to ingested food. Prior to this study, the primary cellular source of IL-9 was unknown, according to the authors.   Our study suggests that although you need to have some level of IgE to trigger a food allergy response, you also have to produce MMC9 cells to get a severe response and anaphylaxis,  says Yui-Hsi Wang, PhD, lead investigator and a researcher in the Division of Allergy and Immunology at Cincinnati Children s.  Without these cells you will not get severe food allergies.  Set off by certain foods like peanuts, shell fish and a host of others, IgE-associated food sensitivity prompts the immune systems of some children to surge out of control. Unless there is immediate medical intervention, this can trigger a molecular chain reaction in the intestines and other organs   leading to diarrhea, hypothermia, respiratory distress and shock. About 40 percent of children have some IgE-associated food sensitivity, but only 8 percent of the 40 percent develop the severe food reactions that can lead to anaphylactic shock, according to Wang.  Unfortunately the best medical intervention for these allergies remains avoiding the foods that cause them,  he said.  We don t know why some patients develop such a strong response and why some don t. This is where we as basic scientists are coming in to see if we can use mouse models to learn this, because mice are very much like humans.  Wang and his colleagues suspect that some people are wired genetically to have higher or lower susceptibility to severe IgE-related allergic reactions. Still, it also remains unknown exactly how genetics contributes to these molecular chain reactions. Just as people with food allergies have different degrees of susceptibility, so do mice. To account for this, the researchers conducted their study in several distinct strains of genetically bred mice. They gave the mice an egg white protein called ovalbumin to trigger allergic reactions and study biological reactions in the animals. They observed that after allergic sensitization, some mouse strains generated large populations of MMC9 cells while other strains did not. Mice that did not produce MMC9 cells exhibited only minor allergic responses. Mice that produced intestinal MMC9 cells all had severe allergic reactions, regardless of whether they had low or high levels of IgE. Wang and his colleagues report that production of MMC9 cells required the presence of type-2 CD4+ T helper immune cells and the proteins interlukin-4 and STAT6. By producing significant amounts of IL-9, the MMC9 cells caused mastocytosis and the production of mast cells, which may migrate out of the intestines to other organs as they secrete histamines and other molecules that cause anaphylaxis. To verify that MMC9 cells were fueling severe allergic reactions in the mice, the researchers treated the mice with an antibody (anti-Fc?RI? mAb), which eliminated the cells and decreased food allergy symptoms. When MMC9 cells were transferred back into the same mice, the animals resumed exhibiting food allergy symptoms. Researchers next conducted tests to see if their identification of MMC9 cells was relevant to the development of human food allergies. Analyzing small intestine biopsy samples from food allergy patients (who gave authorized consent) the scientists looked for molecular signatures of MMC9 cells. They found significantly increased expression of the Il9 genetic transcript and other related transcripts in the samples of food allergy patients, suggesting a possible connection. Wang said the researchers are now trying to find the human equivalent (orthologue) of the MMC9 cells they found in their mouse models. One goal the researchers have is to identify that cell and its biological mediators to see if it possible to develop a biomarker that might allow development of a blood test for food allergies. Eventually, Wang said, the team wants to develop a blood test that would allow clinicians to determine which patients are at higher risk for severe food allergies, and to find improved treatments for food allergy.","Published: September 24, 2015"

The risk increased with the frequency of insecticide use, the authors found. They did not find a cancer link to outdoor insecticides.

The study breathes new life into the field of targeted delivery, the ongoing effort to fashion treatments that affect diseased areas but leave healthy tissue alone. ""We call this a smart particle,"" said James Swartz, the professor of chemical engineering and of bioengineering at Stanford who led the study. ""We make it smart by adding molecular tags that act like addresses to send the therapeutic payload where we want it to go."" Using the smart particle for immunotherapy would involve tagging its outer surface with molecules designed to teach the body's disease-fighting cells to recognize and destroy cancers, Swartz said.For Swartz and his principal collaborator, Yuan Lu, now a pharmacology researcher at the University of Tokyo, the result is a vindication. When they first started the research four years ago, funding agencies said it couldn't be done. It will require much more effort to accomplish the second goal   packing tiny quantities of medicines into the smart particles, delivering the particles to and into diseased cells, and engineering them to release their payloads. 'Proof of principle' ""This was a proof-of-principle experiment so there's a lot of work to be done,"" Swartz said. ""But I believe we can use this smart particle to deliver cancer-fighting immunotherapies that will have minimal side effects."" Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Robert Langer, a leader in targeted drug delivery research who was not connected to the Stanford experiments, also read the paper before publication. ""This is terrific work, a beautiful paper,"" Langer said. ""Dr. Swartz and colleagues have done a remarkable job of stabilizing viruslike particles and re-engineering their surface."" Targeted drug delivery is one of the ultimate goals of medicine because it seeks to focus remedies on diseased cells, minimizing the side effects that occur when, for instance, radiation or chemotherapies harm healthy cells while treating cancer. Looking for a model in nature, many researchers focused on viruses, which target specific cells, sneak in and deliver an infectious payload. The new paper describes how the Stanford team designed a viruslike particle that is only a delivery vehicle with no infectious payload. They started with the virus that causes hepatitis B. This virus has three layers like an egg, and the researchers focused on the non-infectious middle layer, called the capsid. It is a complex protein structure, and when properly assembled this capsid looks like a skeletal soccer ball with lots of spikes sticking out. Other researchers have had the same idea for repurposing the hepatitis B capsid because its hollow structure is large enough, in theory, to carry a significant medical payload. But in practice this had proven so difficult that when Swartz floated the idea to funding agencies they said no. But Swartz was so certain his approach would work that he found ways to bootstrap the project over the several years that it took to finish his experiments. Next steps Biotechnologists know how to build the complex protein structures they find in nature, but the Stanford team took this further. They didn't just build the capsid nature provided. They studied the DNA that directs the structure to assemble and re-engineered the code to custom-design a capsid that would be invisible to the immune system, sturdy enough to survive a trip through the bloodstream and have a surface that would be simple to attach molecular tags to. Bioengineering the surface was important. If the researchers wanted the capsid to teach the immune system to destroy cancer cells, they would hang vaccine tags on the spikes. If, on the other hand, they wanted the capsid to deliver medicines to a sick cell, they would hang address tags on the spikes. Finally, the researchers had to make all these modifications without destroying the miraculous capability of the capsid's DNA code to direct 240 copies of one protein to self-assemble into a hollow sphere with a spiky surface. Swartz said the next step is to attach cancer tags to the outside of this smart particle, to use it to train the immune system to recognize certain cancers. Those experiments would likely occur in mice. After that he will add the next function   further engineering the DNA code to make sure that the protein can self-assemble around a small medicinal payload. ""That will be quite complicated, but we've already gotten this far when they said it couldn't be done,"" Swartz said.","Published: September 24, 2015"

MOR202 is a fully human HuCAL antibody targeting CD38, a highly expressed and validated target in multiple myeloma. The clinical data, which will be presented at the 15th International Myeloma Workshop in Rome, Italy, September 23th-26th, confirm the very good overall safety profile previously reported at this year's ASCO meeting. The update also includes promising first results from the highest dose escalation cohort of 16 mg/kg of MOR202 weekly plus dexamethasone and from the recently initiated combination arms with the immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) pomalidomide and lenalidomide. As of August 24, 2015, 50 heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma had received MOR202 with and without dexamethasone and in a few cases in combination with pomalidomide or lenalidomide as part of a recently initiated second part of the study. MOR202 continued to demonstrate long-lasting tumor control, as well as signs of activity. In addition to the earlier reported very good partial response (VGPR) in a cohort dosed weekly with 4 mg/kg of MOR202 plus dexamethasone, a minor response (MR) in the 8 mg/kg MOR202 weekly plus dexamethasone cohort further improved into a partial response (PR). A first MR was observed in one patient in an ongoing cohort at the highest dose level, of 16 mg/kg MOR202 plus dexamethasone. The first evaluable patient in the ongoing combination cohort of 8 mg/kg MOR202 plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone achieved a PR already after the first cycle. In the ongoing combination cohort of 8 mg/kg MOR202 plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone, one patient showed a MR after the first cycle. In total, the data shows one VGPR, two PRs and two MRs so far. ""The MOR202 data have matured nicely since we presented the program at this year's ASCO conference and we expect an even more comprehensive picture as the trial progresses. First results from the combination cohorts with lenalidomide and pomalidomide confirm the synergistic potential we have demonstrated in preclinical studies using our antibody together with these two IMiDs. This bodes well for the future development of MOR202,"" commented Dr. Arndt Schottelius, Chief Development Officer of MorphoSys AG. The data to be presented at the International Myeloma Workshop 2015 show that MOR202 was safe and tolerable and could be administered as a 2-hour infusion. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 15 patients (30%). Only one out of these 15 patients received dexamethasone as co-medication and experienced an infusion-related reaction (grade 1). In the absence of dexamethasone, all infusion reactions were grade 1-2 except for one patient with grade 3, mainly limited to the first infusion. The maximum tolerated dose has not been reached. ""The antibody continues to show a balanced safety and tolerability profile and the preliminary efficacy seen so far with MOR202 as single agent and in combinations is promising. Considering the low rate of infusion reactions, even in cohorts without dexamethasone, the short infusion time and other aspects, MOR202 may turn out to be an excellent choice in terms of safety and tolerability,"" commented Dr. Marc-Steffen Raab, Group Leader Experimental Therapies for Hematologic Malignancies at the Heidelberg University Hospital and the German Cancer Research Center DKFZ.

The awards are for three years each, and total approximately $13 million, pending the availability of funds. They are administered by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the National Cancer Institute, both parts of NIH. Comparing the genomes of many people suggests that there are tens of millions of genetic variants, or DNA spelling differences. For the last decade, scientists have used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to find regions of the genome associated with diseases and traits. In GWAS, the genomes of thousands of people with and without a disease are compared to find the genomic regions containing variants that affect disease risk. Although GWAS may find hundreds of variants that appear to be associated with a disease, it remains a challenge to find out which variants actually have a role in the disease process, and what that role might be.  Before we can understand how a variant or gene functionally contributes to a disease   and then develop prevention and therapeutic strategies   we have to identify which genes and variants actually are involved in raising the risk,  said Lisa Brooks, Ph.D., program director of the NHGRI Genetic Variation Program.  We are looking for approaches that can find the causal variants out of the many variants associated with a disease, or at least narrow down the set.  Most variants, including many that contribute to disease risk, response to drugs, and traits such as height, are in genomic regions that do not code for proteins. These variants usually affect the regulation of genes, residing within  switches  in the genome that determine when and where proteins are made.  We know a great deal about the protein-coding genes and what they do,  said Mike Pazin, Ph.D., program director in the NHGRI Functional Genomics Program.  For variants sitting outside the coding regions, it is difficult to know which parts of the genome they affect, let alone how the variants cause differences in function. However, we know that 90 percent of associated variants found in GWAS are outside of the protein-coding areas. Eventually, we want to understand mechanistically how the variants function in regulating genes, and how differences in the way they function affect disease risk.  The researchers are developing computational approaches to combine many different sets of data to identify disease-causing variants or narrow down the set of candidate variants. They will use data from experiments to determine the accuracy of the computational predictions. The following grants have been awarded (pending availability of funds):   Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts; $2.6 million, three yearsPrincipal Investigator: Nir Hacohen, Ph.D.To understand the DNA drivers of common human diseases (using immune diseases as test cases), the researchers plan to analyze how DNA variants that are associated with common immune diseases cause individuals to differ in their immune responses.  Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; $2.5 million, three years Principal Investigator: Manolis Kellis, Ph.D.The researchers plan to interpret the importance of non-coding variants in human disease by studying their activity patterns and how variants influence chemical modifications called epigenomic marks, which affect gene regulation. They will develop statistical methods to identify locations in the genome where variants are more likely to affect the regulation of genes.  University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; $2.2 million, three yearsPrincipal Investigators: Alain Laederach, Ph.D. and Kevin Weeks, Ph.D.Although non-coding regions of the genome are not translated into proteins, they may be transcribed into RNA. Such RNA carries out various regulatory functions in a cell. The researchers have shown that disrupting RNA structure can lead to diseases in people, including an inherited eye cancer, retinoblastoma. They would like to develop computational approaches to predict structural changes in RNA that are caused by genetic variants.  Stanford University, Stanford, California; $1.4 million, three yearsPrincipal Investigator: Stephen Montgomery, Ph.D.The researchers will develop methods for interpreting non-coding genetic variation and for predicting disease-causing variants in the subjects  genomes. They plan to develop various statistical models based on large amounts of information from individuals, and identify variants that contribute to hundreds of diseases and traits.  University of California, San Diego/Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research; $2.3 million, three yearsPrincipal Investigator: Bing Ren, Ph.D.Previous studies have identified a number of DNA sequence variants strongly associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of blindness among seniors. In this project, the researchers will create computational models that can predict or narrow down non-coding sequence variants that contribute to the development of disease, using AMD as a test case.  University of Washington/UW Medicine, Seattle and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, Huntsville, Alabama; $1.9 million, three years (supported by the National Cancer Institute)Principal Investigators: Jay Shendure, M.D., Ph.D. and Greg Cooper, Ph.D. The researchers seek to develop better ways to identify non-coding genetic variants that contribute to human disease. They plan to test a system they developed called Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), which aims to identify which individual genetic variants contribute to disease. They will test and further refine the method as well as explore other related approaches in genome sequencing studies of both rare and common diseases.","Published: September 24, 2015"

Peterson, MD, director of the Institute for the Developing Mind at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, have shown that lower levels of conflict-related brain activity are associated with a higher risk for later psychosis. Adolescence is an important period for cognitive and emotional development, including the coordination of a vast array of cognitive functions that comprise cognitive control -- the ability for the brain to negotiate competing demands in the service of attaining life goals. Many psychiatric disorders first manifest themselves during adolescence, and neurocognitive abnormalities, particularly in cognitive control, may be a core feature of such illness. Little is known about the role in the development of psychosis played by functional brain circuits that support cognitive control. ""The great strength of this and other studies that look at high-risk individuals is that we are able to disentangle what comes first -- and is therefore a potential cause -- and what comes second and more likely to be a consequence of the risk markers or indicators,"" said Peterson, who is also director of the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California (USC). Using functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) the scientists set out to determine the nature and extent of abnormalities in the neural system supporting cognitive control in adolescents and young adults at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. The team looked at 56 CHR individuals enrolled in the COPE (Center of Prevention and Evaluation) clinic at the New York Psychiatric Institute, and 49 healthy controls, all with a mean age of 21 and matched age, gender and minority status. During fMRI scanning to detect conflicting signals in the brain, study participants performed tests designed to measure cognitive flexibility, among other functions. Comparing the two groups, the researchers detected reduced conflict-related functional activity in several cortical areas of the CHR group compared with healthy controls. These areas included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or DLPFC (a functional control region of the brain with a long period of maturation leading into adolescence) and the dorsal striatum (involved in reward and decision-making). Higher levels of conflict-related activation in these areas as shown by fMRI were associated with better social and role outcome. Furthermore, the study showed that conflict-related activations in the DLPFC of those CHR individuals who ultimately developed psychosis were smaller than in those who did not. ""We interpret these findings as evidence that conflict-related brain activation represents an adaptive process that is diminished in individuals at high risk for psychosis, though further study is needed,"" Peterson concluded.

The study, written by UTMB's Claudia Hilton, associate professor, Tim Reistetter, associate professor and Diane Collins, assistant professor, all from the UTMB occupational therapy and rehabilitation sciences departments, concludes that findings suggest the use of exergaming, more specifically the Makoto arena, has the potential to serve as a valuable addition to therapies for children with autism spectrum disorders who have motor and executive function impairments. Executive function is the higher level of intelligence that helps us to plan and organize. It is used to redirect higher thinking when changing plans and suppressing inappropriate behaviors. It is important for being able to live independently as adults. Through the use of the exergame called the Makoto arena, researchers showed improvement in response speed, executive function and motor skills among children with ASD. The research was conducted with 17 subjects with an autism diagnosis over 30 sessions for over 1,800 total attempts to hit the targets. The International Journal for Sports and Exercise Medicine recently published the findings. ""We think that the exertion of participating in this type of game helps to improve the neural connections in the brains of these children,"" Hilton said. ""This is a small pilot study, but we hope to obtain grant funding to confirm these findings in a larger group of children with autism and to examine the changes that are occurring in the brain."" Children with ASD often experience executive function and motor impairments. They also experience lower rates of physical activity than children without ASD. As they get older, their physical activity declines and they deal with obesity problems more than other children. Comparing out of school activity participation, physical activity showed the greatest differences between ASD and control children, with the ASD children less active. As a way to combat a lack of physical activity, researchers investigated the use of the Makoto arena, a triangular shaped arena with pillars at each point, each with lights and sounds at various levels of the pillars. Those playing the game must hit the correct spots as they light up on different pillars. The study used 17 school-aged children and adolescents with ASD in two-minute sessions in the Makoto arena. The speed of the game increased when the participants reached 95 percent accuracy. Subjects competed in the Makoto arena an average six sessions per week. The study saw significant improvements across several physical and mental areas, including response speed. All areas of executive function improved, especially working memory. Motor ability also improved, especially in the areas of strength and agility. ""It is difficult to get children with autism to participate in physically exerting activities,"" Hilton said. ""So finding an activity like the Makoto arena that they will actually do over an extended period like this is very exciting.""

Scientists have long known that the hippocampus plays a critical role in forming and preserving memories. Prior studies have extensively investigated a particular cluster of cells within the hippocampus called CA1, but comparatively little attention has been paid to an area of the hippocampus called CA3. The new study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, found surprising patterns of activity in the first-ever detailed recordings of CA3 pyramidal cells from aging rats. Up until now, scientists have assumed that the cells in CA3 acted similarly to those in CA1. But when senior author John Disterhoft, the Ernest J. and Hattie H. Magerstadt Memorial Research Professor of Physiology, and his colleagues at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine compared the activity of CA3 cells in hippocampal slices from young rats and older rats, they found the neurons were hyperactive in older animals -- in CA3, cells became more excitable and fired more often in old age. ""We were actually quite surprised at the pattern of changes we saw in the recordings,"" Disterhoft said. ""Before this study, there had been some evidence that CA3 was more excitable during aging and cognitive impairment in humans, but we didn't understand the mechanism. These findings are pointing us to more effective therapeutics."" The increased excitability seen in CA3 was exactly the opposite of the decreased activity previously seen in nearby CA1, which has long been associated with memory impairment and cognitive decline. Next, the scientists altered the behavior of CA3 neurons' ion channels to explain the exact mechanism behind that increase in activity. They discovered that a subset of voltage-gated potassium channels, called A-type Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 potassium channels, were specifically associated with the increase in CA3 activity seen in older brains. When the potassium channels were blocked, the cells' activity became similar to that in a young brain. The location of the increased Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 potassium channels was visualized with a very sensitive light microscopic technique in the laboratory of co-author Daniel Nicholson, an assistant professor at Rush University Medical Center. ""What we can do now very well is identify the cellular properties of abnormal things that change with aging and discover how we can make it young-like again,"" said study co-author Matthew Oh, research assistant professor of physiology at Feinberg. Disterhoft said the study's findings are important because they show that not all parts of the brain react in the same way to aging. They also make the case that future treatments for the cognitive decline seen in aging as well as in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease will need to account for many different effects, including the age-related hyperactivity his team found in CA3 neurons. ""These findings underscore the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the aging brain, and why many fronts must be explored in our search for effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias,"" said Molly Wagster, a branch chief within the neuroscience division of the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health, a co-funder of the research. Before this discovery, other scientists working towards ""curing"" memory loss focused primarily on ways to increase activity in neurons, Disterhoft said. ""If drug discovery efforts were solely based on results from CA1 neurons, as they were prior to our current findings, then increasing activity of CA1 neurons may be helpful in restoring the function of CA1 in aged subjects, but at the same time it may prove even more detrimental to the CA3 neurons that are already hyperactive,"" he said. These new findings are the first evidence that reducing activity in some hippocampal areas, while increasing it in other areas, may be a successful strategy for combating cognitive decline. ""If medical research is to improve cognitive health and find cures for neurodegenerative disorders with aging, it's essential to identify what is normal and abnormal in the various neurons of the brain during the aging process. This study is an important step in that process,"" Disterhoft said. Future research will examine another poorly understood brain region that sends input to the hippocampus, called the entorhinal cortex and examine how neurons there act differently in young and aging brains.

In a new study, National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists report they can detect infectious prion protein in mouse brains within a week of inoculation. Equally surprising, the protein was generated outside blood vessels in a place in the brain where scientists believe drug treatment could be targeted to prevent disease. The study, from NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), appears in the jounral mBio. Scientists believe prion diseases potentially could be treated if therapy starts early in the disease cycle. However, identifying who needs treatment and pinpointing the optimal timeframe for treatment are open questions for researchers. Human prion diseases include variant, familial and sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The most common form, sporadic CJD, affects an estimated one in one million people annually worldwide. Other prion diseases include scrapie in sheep, chronic wasting disease in deer, elk and moose, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle. In their study, the NIAID scientists injected infectious scrapie prion protein into the brains of mice. After 30 minutes, they began observing whether the injected material generated new infectious protein at the injection site. By examining mouse brain tissue, the researchers measured and detected new infectious prion protein three days after infection on the outside walls of capillaries and other blood vessels at the injection site. Using Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC), a feasible testing method for people, the scientists detected newly generated prion protein after seven days. In prior studies, it took about six weeks to detect infectious prion protein. The new findings enhance scientific understanding of where infectious prion diseases might take hold in the brain and provide possible targets for treatment.

The new analysis, reported in the journal Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, offers the first evidence that optimism plays a mediating role in the relationship between the size of the OFC and anxiety. Anxiety disorders afflict roughly 44 million people in the U.S. These disorders disrupt lives and cost an estimated $42 billion to $47 billion annually, scientists report. The orbitofrontal cortex, a brain region located just behind the eyes, is known to play a role in anxiety. The OFC integrates intellectual and emotional information and is essential to behavioral regulation. Previous studies have found links between the size of a person's OFC and his or her susceptibility to anxiety. For example, in a well-known study of young adults whose brains were imaged before and after the colossal 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, researchers discovered that the OFC actually shrank in some study subjects within four months of the disaster. Those with more OFC shrinkage were likely to also be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, the researchers found. Other studies have shown that more optimistic people tend to be less anxious, and that optimistic thoughts increase OFC activity. The team on the new study hypothesized that a larger OFC might act as a buffer against anxiety in part by boosting optimism. Most studies of anxiety focus on those who have been diagnosed with anxiety disorders, said University of Illinois researcher Sanda Dolcos, who led the research with graduate student Yifan Hu and psychology professor Florin Dolcos. ""We wanted to go in the opposite direction,"" she said. ""If there can be shrinkage of the orbitofrontal cortex and that shrinkage is associated with anxiety disorders, what does it mean in healthy populations that have larger OFCs? Could that have a protective role?"" The researchers also wanted to know whether optimism was part of the mechanism linking larger OFC brain volumes to lesser anxiety. The team collected MRIs of 61 healthy young adults and analyzed the structure of a number of regions in their brains, including the OFC. The researchers calculated the volume of gray matter in each brain region relative to the overall volume of the brain. The study subjects also completed tests that assessed their optimism and anxiety, depression symptoms, and positive (enthusiastic, interested) and negative (irritable, upset) affect. A statistical analysis and modeling revealed that a thicker orbitofrontal cortex on the left side of the brain corresponded to higher optimism and less anxiety. The model also suggested that optimism played a mediating role in reducing anxiety in those with larger OFCs. Further analyses ruled out the role of other positive traits in reducing anxiety, and no other brain structures appeared to be involved in reducing anxiety by boosting optimism. ""You can say, 'OK, there is a relationship between the orbitofrontal cortex and anxiety. What do I do to reduce anxiety?'"" Sanda Dolcos said. ""And our model is saying, this is working partially through optimism. So optimism is one of the factors that can be targeted."" ""Optimism has been investigated in social psychology for years. But somehow only recently did we start to look at functional and structural associations of this trait in the brain,"" Hu said. ""We wanted to know: If we are consistently optimistic about life, would that leave a mark in the brain?"" Florin Dolcos said future studies should test whether optimism can be increased and anxiety reduced by training people in tasks that engage the orbitofrontal cortex, or by finding ways to boost optimism directly. ""If you can train people's responses, the theory is that over longer periods, their ability to control their responses on a moment-by-moment basis will eventually be embedded in their brain structure,"" he said.

Using a new MRI technique, the UCLA team measured the volume of cerebral arteries twice using a technique called Arterial Spin Labeling, which can magnetically  label  the blood in arteries without the use of an external agent. The team measured once at the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle, when the heart was pumping the blood into the brain, and again at the diastolic phase, when the heart was relaxing. That team found that the stiffer the arteries were, the smaller the change in the arterial blood volume between the two cardiac phases, because stiff arteries are not as able to change shape or comply with the blood pressure changes as elastic arteries are, said study senior author Danny J.J. Wang, an associate professor of neurology and a researcher in the Ahmanson-Lovelace Brain Mapping Center at UCLA.  Vascular compliance is a useful marker for a number of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes,  Wang said.  Growing evidence suggests intracranial vascular pathology also may be associated with the origin and progression of cerebrovascular disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer s disease, which is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. However, to date, few methods are available to assess it.  The study appears this week in the journal NeuroImage. The UCLA team compared stiffness measurements in young and elderly patients, and found that arterial stiffness is significantly increased in elderly patients. This finding is consistent with the theory that aging is associated with stiffening of the arteries. They also found that increased arterial stiffness is associated with reduced cerebral blood flow, suggesting stiff arteries impair the blood supply to the brain. Additionally, they found artery stiffness is correlated with the stiffness of the largest artery of the human body, the aorta.   We hope our technique can provide an early marker for a number of socioeconomically important diseases like Alzheimer s,  said study first author Lirong Yan, an assistant researcher in the UCLA Department of Neurology.  A number of studies suggest that vascular dysfunctions, including arterial stiffening, are associated with the development of Alzheimer s. The development of early bio- or imaging markers for Alzheimer s is of great importance for slowing disease progression. Hardened arteries due to the accumulation of plaques on the vessel walls also is linked to cerebrovascular disorders such as stroke. We hope our technique may provide an early marker for the prevention of stroke.  The need for a new approach to treatment of Alzheimer s disease is urgent. Alzheimer s is the most common age-related dementia and the number of cases in the United States is expected to increase from the current number of about five to six million to 15 million by 2050. The costs to family life and on the health care system are enormous. Alzheimer s and other dementias are projected to cost the United States $226 billion in 2015 alone, with that number rising to as high as $1.1 trillion in 2050.

Parkinson s disease causes progressive problems with movement, posture and balance. It is currently treated with drugs, but these have severe side-effects and can become ineffective after around five years. The only treatment subsequently available to patients is deep brain stimulation, a surgical technique where an electrical current is used to stimulate nerve cells in the brain. As well as being an invasive treatment, it has mixed results   some patients benefit while others experience no improvement or even deteriorate. Researchers believe this is because the treatment is imprecise, stimulating all types of nerve cells, not just the intended target. The new study examined a less invasive and more precise alternative, designed to target and stimulate a particular type of nerve cell called cholinergic neurons. These are found within a part of the brain called the pedunculopontine nucleus, or PPN.  If you were to peer inside the PPN, it is like a jungle with a massive variety of nerve cells that behave differently and have different jobs to do,  said Dr Ilse Pienaar, Honorary Lecturer in Neuroscience at Imperial College London. Scientists already suspect that cholinergic neuron cells are involved in Parkinson s disease. This is because in post mortem studies of patients  brains, about half of these cells have perished, for reasons that are currently unknown. The researchers worked with rats that had been treated to recreate the symptoms of Parkinson s disease. They used a harmless virus to deliver a specially-designed genetic  switch  to the cholinergic neurons. The rats were then given a drug that was designed to activate the  switch  and stimulate the target neurons. Following the treatment the rats made an almost complete recovery and were able to move normally. Dr Pienaar adds:  This study confirms that cholinergic neurons are key to the gait problems and postural instability experienced by advanced Parkinson s disease patients. It also suggests that it s possible to target those cells that remain to compensate for those that are no longer functioning effectively, possibly due to weak communication between nerve cells. If we can transfer this technique into people, we believe this could help patients regain mobility.   At the moment, neurosurgeons are attempting to target specific areas with deep brain stimulation, but it is a blunt tool with correspondingly mixed results. We think we have found a way to target only the cholinergic neurons within an area such as the PPN.  Dr Joanna Elson at the Institute of Genetic Medicine at Newcastle University added:  The structure we studied is complex, very complex. Despite this complexity and the intricacy of the techniques and the brain region analysed, the results are exciting because of the potential to advance patient treatment.  ""This paper will help us understand how deep-brain stimulation works, but more importantly it is a step towards offering less invasive treatment options to patients with Parkinson s and other neurodegenerative disorders.  The researchers believe the technique could transfer into people in the next five to ten years. They also think their technique could have wider potential. Dr Pienaar said:  Parkinson s disease patients experience a complex set of symptoms and we hope to use the same method to understand how different cells within the brain contribute to the disease.

Dr. Mitchell completed his post-doc at the University of Arizona (Dept. of Neuroscience) with Dr. John Hildebrand and is beginning a tenure-track Assistant Professorship in the Biology Department at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh.  His research involves mapping neural structures used by insects to respond to key odors such as pheromones and host plant volatiles. This research has very practical implications:  characterizing those structures will fast-track the identification of odors that strongly influence insect behavior, yielding new methods to monitor and control insect pests. The SFA will be especially helpful in Dr. Mitchell s new lab. During his graduate work at UA, Dr. Mitchell had ready access to a fluorescence microscope to check his sample preparations before renting time on the university s confocal microscope. However, his facility at UW Oshkosh has neither microscope readily available so he plans to use the NIGHTSEA system to pre-screen his samples before making the 100-mile trip to UW Madison to use their confocal. Dr. Mazel instituted the Key Award to acknowledge his own mentors and to give back to Science.  Dr. Mitchell will pay NIGHTSEA s generosity forward in his new position as Instructor of biology and curator of the insect collection at UW Oshkosh.  As he cited in his Key Award application,  [The NIGHTSEA SFA] is an excellent platform for students to directly learn the principles of   fluorescence microscopy, and will allow me to translate my experience in insect neurophysiology [both] in outreach activities at the insect collection and in school classrooms.  According to NIGHTSEA founder Dr. Charles Mazel, the number and quality of the applications  presented a tough challenge for the award s academic selection committee.

To prepare for a journey to Mars, it is important to understand how long-duration spaceflight affects microorganisms because changes to this complex ecosystem could be detrimental to future missions. There are 10 times more microbial cells than human cells in and on the human body, weighing up to five pounds. Hundreds of species inhabit the body, and some have a beneficial effect on health. They protect humans by competing with other organisms and guarding against pathogens. They also aid in absorption of nutrients and digestion, and can even impact moods and mental states. The absence of these microbes can be harmful.They are reintroduced into the body with fresh fruits, vegetables and probiotics like yogurt; food sources not readily available in space. Literally, the phrase, ""you are what you eat,"" is important to future crews. Loss of these species can lead to altered metabolic function, and in conjunction with reduced immune response, may increase the chance of infection by microorganisms that normally do not harm their host but can when resistance is low.The Microbiome experiment examines the impact of space travel on both an individual's microbiome, which is the community of microorganisms that literally share our body space, and the human immune system. Researchers are collecting various samples (gastrointestinal, saliva, blood, potable water, perspiration, swabs of the body, and equipment) to determine how microgravity, environment, diet, and stress affect the microbiome and immune system. By sampling the microbiome of astronauts on Earth while in peak physical health and during subsequent times of stress in space, researchers are able to define human response triggers. Additionally, studying how the microbiome changes over time in the gastrointestinal tract helps predict other changes in immune function. Response triggers which cause changes in the microbiome increase the risks of contracting diseases. Results from this study could advance research in early detection and prevention of diseases and alterations in metabolic function and immunity. Resulting therapies could mitigate microbiome changes or related health issues for people on Earth who live and work in stressful environments. So when you take your next bite of food, thank your microbial friends for winning the war in your gut. You're healthier and happier because they're doing their job. NASA's Human Research Program enables space exploration by reducing the risks to human health and performance through a focused program of basic, applied, and operational research.

Headed by Prof. Vicki Wysocki, an Ohio Eminent Scholar and Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry, the Center is widely renowned for fundamental research into ways of characterizing protein complexes, or assemblies of multiple individual proteins, that living organisms depend on for their survival. Ultimately, the research of the Wysocki Research Group could one day lead to new understanding of conditions, such as high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis, pre-eclampsia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, among others.  We are honored to join the Waters Centers of Innovation Program as a partner and applaud the state-of-the-art instrumentation and technical support that Waters has provided,  said Caroline Whitacre, Vice President for Research at Ohio State.  Having access to the Waters technology has enabled the stellar work of Dr. Wysocki as she works to develop improved mass spectrometry approaches to determine structures of protein complexes. This research is helping researchers across the Ohio State campus and elsewhere to achieve breakthroughs and develop solutions that will have global impact.  Also on hand to congratulate Prof. Wysocki and her team was Eric Fotheringham, Director, Waters Centers of Innovation Program.  Vicki is an exemplary scientist and a highly-respected member of the worldwide mass spectrometry community. She is certainly deserving of this recognition and we are proud to have her participate in our program.  Abetting Wysocki in her research are advances in mass spectrometry technologies that allow her to probe the structures of protein complexes like never before.  One of the important goals of our research is understanding how we might interrupt a disease or correct for a disease, or develop a drug target. Waters instruments are important to our research because of the ion mobility technology embedded in their quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometers. This technology allows us to measure not just a protein complex s mass/charge ratio but also their shape, and this is incredibly important if we are to understand their function or identify when unfolding has occurred, which can be a sign of damage caused by an adverse event,  said Wysocki. The driving force behind the technique of surface induced dissociation (SID) for mass spectrometry, Prof. Wysocki leads a research group exploring new ways of examining protein complexes by experimenting with SID on various instrument platforms. A mother, a teacher and a mentor, Prof. Wysocki is also an officer with the American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS), currently serving as Vice-President for Programs. In 1992, Professor Wysocki received an ASMS Research Award, presented annually to young academic scientists to further her research in mass spectrometry, and in 2009 she received a Distinguished Contribution to Mass Spectrometry Award, the Society s highest achievement award. She is also one of 120 distinguished scientists, and one of six women, profiled in Elsevier s Encyclopedia of Mass Spectrometry (2015) for contributions to mass spectrometry over the last century.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/role-of-cancersuppressing-gene-uncovered-208084,Role Of Cancer Suppressing Gene Uncovered The findings open new opportunities for scientists to find treatments for cancer  The findings shed light on the activity of the gene WWOX  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.  We ve known for some time that in certain types of cancer people with low levels of WWOX protein are more likely to develop cancer. We also know that cancers with low levels of WWOX tend to be more aggressive and less responsive to treatment,  says Professor Rob Richards, Head of Genetics and Evolution in the University s School of Biological Sciences.  So a higher level of WWOX activity is definitely a good thing to have but, until now, the role that WWOX plays in cancer suppression has been a mystery.  Professor Richards and his team of researchers, Dr Louise O Keefe and PhD students Amanda Choo and Cheng Shoou Lee, studied the impact of lower levels of WWOX on cells using a genetic model   the small laboratory fly, Drosophila.  Our research has shown that cancer cells with lower levels of WWOX had a competitive advantage over those cells with normal WWOX levels, and could outgrow them,  says Professor Richards.  This could lead to a more aggressive cancer and worse outcomes for cancer patients   poorer survival rates.  Further research showed that the WWOX gene plays a role in the altered metabolism of cancer cells which are known to use glucose differently to normal cells. Cancer cells tend to use glucose to make more cell  building blocks  than energy, and this is thought to help them to divide and grow.   Another set of Drosophila experiments revealed that the WWOX gene helps keep the balance of glucose use in favour of producing energy rather than helping cancer cells multiply,  says Professor Richards.  This difference in metabolism is a key part of how cancer cells have a competitive advantage over normal cells. Low WWOX levels will allow more glucose to be used for these cancer cell  building blocks .  The good news is that WWOX belongs to a family of proteins that have enzyme activity   this means WWOX activity can be altered by targeting the enzyme.  We now have a good idea of what WWOX does in cancer cells and how it acts to help suppress cancer. And we have a potential target to be able to influence that activity to change the properties of cancer cells,  says Professor Richards.","Published: September 23, 2015"

The findings demonstrate the extent to which humans possess a unique 'microbial cloud signature'. To test the individualized nature of the personal microbial cloud, University of Oregon researchers sequenced microbes from the air surrounding 11 different people in a sanitized experimental chamber. The study found that most of the occupants sitting alone in the chamber could be identified within 4 hours just by the unique combinations of bacteria in the surrounding air.  The striking results were driven by several groups of bacteria that are ubiquitous on and in humans, such as Streptococcus, which is commonly found in the mouth, and Propionibacterium and Corynebacterium, both common skin residents. While these common human-associated microbes were detected in the air around all people in the study, the authors found that the different combinations of those bacteria were the key to distinguishing among individual people.The analyses, utilizing analysis of suspended particulate matter and short-read 16S sequencing, focused on categorizing whole microbial communities rather than identifying pathogens. The findings emerged from two different studies and more than 14 million sequences representing thousands of different types of bacteria found in the 312 samples from air and dust from the experimental chamber. ""We expected that we would be able to detect the human microbiome in the air around a person, but we were surprised to find that we could identify most of the occupants just by sampling their microbial cloud,"" said lead author James F. Meadow, a postdoctoral researcher formerly from the Biology and the Built Environment Center at the University of Oregon. ""Our results confirm that an occupied space is microbially distinct from an unoccupied one, and and demonstrate for the first time that individuals release their own personalized microbial cloud,"" the authors concluded. The research sheds light on the extent to which we release our human microbiome to our surrounding environment, and might help understand the mechanisms involved in the spread of infectious diseases in buildings. The results also suggest potential forensic applications, for example to identify or determine where a person has been, though it is unclear whether individual occupants can be detected in a crowd of other people.","Published: September 23, 2015"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/identifying-the-dimmer-switch-of-diabetes-197601,Identifying The  Dimmer Switch  Of Diabetes University of Alberta research gives new insight into what causes Type   diabetes  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Patrick MacDonald has dedicated much of his life to diabetes research. It s a job he knows is far too large and complex for any one person, but with his latest publication, he knows his work is playing a part. MacDonald, a Canada Research Chair in Islet Biology, associate professor in the University of Alberta s Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry and member of the Alberta Diabetes Institute, is the senior author of a landmark study.The researchers examined pancreatic islet cells from 99 human organ donors and identified a new molecular pathway that manages the amount of insulin produced by the pancreatic cells essentially a  dimmer  switch that adjusts how much or how little insulin is secreted when blood sugar increases. According to MacDonald, the dimmer appears to be lost in Type 2 diabetes but can be restored and  turned back on reviving proper control of insulin secretion from islet cells of people with Type 2 diabetes. The discovery is a potential game-changer in Type 2 diabetes research, leading to a new way of thinking about the disease and its future treatment.  Understanding the islet cells in the pancreas that make insulin, how they work and how they can fail could lead to new ways to treat the disease, delaying or even preventing diabetes,  says MacDonald. Ten million Canadians are living with diabetes or prediabetes. The Canadian Diabetes Association reports that more than 20 Canadians are newly diagnosed with the disease every hour of every day. It is also the seventh leading cause of death in Canada, with associated health-care costs estimated at nearly $9 billion a year. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 per cent of all cases, increasing the risk of blindness, nerve damage, stroke, heart disease and several other serious health conditions. MacDonald believes the key to his latest research has been access to the Alberta Diabetes Institute s IsletCore. The biobank, established with funding from the Alberta Diabetes Foundation and the U of A, collects pancreatic islets from organ donors with and without diabetes for diabetes research in Edmonton and across North America.  Without access to this critical tissue through the Alberta Diabetes Institute IsletCore and the generosity of organ donors and their families, we would not have been able to carry out this study,  says MacDonald.  If we want to learn about diabetes, and how to treat and prevent it, studying the insulin-producing cells from donors with diabetes is a powerful way to do it.  Though important new strides in the fight against Type 2 diabetes have been taken, MacDonald stresses that much more needs to be done. The ability to restore and fix the dimmer switch in islet cells may have been proven on a molecular level, but finding a way to translate those findings into clinical use could yet take decades. Despite this, MacDonald believes the findings show an important new way forward.  We don t know enough to stop Type 2 diabetes yet, but this is a large step towards understanding what s going wrong in the first place. ","Published: September 23, 2015"

Combining cancer therapies offers the potential for increased efficacy over monotherapy and the possibility of overcoming drug resistance. The DREAM Challenge is based on the development of computer models that identify the properties of drugs that make them powerful in combination. The winners will have their predictions for the best combinations of cancer drugs based on their properties submitted for publication in the journal Nature Biotechnology. The data released by AstraZeneca include around 10,000 tested combinations that measure the ability of drugs to destroy cancer cell lines from different tumour types including colon, lung, and breast cancer. For the same cell lines, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute is making genomic data available to DREAM Challenge participants. Susan Galbraith, Head of the Oncology Innovative Medicines Unit at AstraZeneca, said:  AstraZeneca has a deep and broad oncology development programme assessing combinations of immunotherapies and small molecules to address the significant unmet need across a wide range of cancers. This open innovation research initiative complements our own efforts brilliantly and we are delighted that the findings could be published for the benefit of the global scientific community.

In a report on the discovery the team says the DNA alterations it uncovered were in premalignant lung lesions known as atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, or AAH, and that the alterations occurred long before the lesions would acquire the ability to invade surrounding tissue and fulfill the definition of adenocarcinoma of the lung.  We believe we were able to detect, for the first time, DNA circulating in the blood from precancerous lesions of the lung,  says Mariana Brait, Ph.D., an assistant professor of otolaryngology head and neck surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a member of the research team.  This work is a big step in advancing our knowledge of lung cancer because it could give us a chance to find people at risk early.  Their analysis also showed, they say, that different regions of the same lesion had various mutations distinctly associated with good and poor outcomes, and that in patients for whom blood samples were available, circulating DNA evidence of the mutations showed up clearly.  This study takes detection to a whole new level in terms of size of the lesion,  says David Sidransky, M.D., professor of oncology and pathology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, director of head and neck cancer research at Johns Hopkins and a member of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.  I m not aware that circulating DNA from precancerous lesions this small has ever been identified before.  Sidransky cautions that the findings are preliminary, involved only a few patients and are but a first step in figuring out how DNA testing might be used to detect precancerous changes at their earliest stages. But the knowledge is invaluable, he says, for both understanding the molecular biology of how lung cancer originates and how to use the findings in clinical applications. According to the American Lung Association, adenocarcinomas are the most frequent subtype of lung cancer and are usually diagnosed after they have spread. The average five-year survival rate for people with adenocarcinoma is 15 percent, even with the most advanced chemotherapy, surgery and other treatments. The prevailing opinion among lung cancer experts is that adenocarcinomas of the lung develop from microscopic lesions that accumulate multiple genetic alterations over time that then lead to malignancy. The problem is that many such precancerous lesions regress and disappear after a few years, but some will progress to cancer, says Evgeny Izumchenko, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Sidransky s laboratory and the lead author of the study. To help sort out factors that might predict which small lesions progress to lung cancer, the team collected tissue samples from six patients undergoing surgical removal of lung tumors. Then William Westra, M.D., professor of pathology, painstakingly went through the tissue samples millimeter by millimeter to single out tiny precancerous AAH lesions in the lung tissue for study. The scientists then extracted and sequenced DNA from these AAH lesions, as well as from other adenocarcinomas in situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinomas and fully invasive adenocarcinomas   a spectrum of lesions that represent the progression from AAH to fully invasive adenocarcinoma. Using a technique known as targeted next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid sequencing of large stretches of DNA, they next looked for mutations in 125 genes known to play a significant role in cancer development and progression. By comparing the DNA of the premalignant lesions with DNA isolated from primary invasive cancer within each patient, the sequencing approach showed that in three of the patients, the same mutations were shared between the premalignant lesions and the tumor from the same patient. This is the first definitive link ever found between potential premalignant lesions and invasive tumors in the same lung, says Izumchenko, and it suggests that those mutations may be the drivers of tumor progression. The team also found that different AAH lesions from different patients had unique patterns of mutations, indicating that lung cancer can be initiated by disturbances in different molecular pathways. The researchers also discovered, to their surprise, they report, that some of the lesions were  dead ends,  harboring mutations in their DNA that most likely were insufficient to progress to full-blown cancer. When the team further explored different regions within the same lesion, they found genetic differences even within the same lesion. Mutations associated with good and poor prognosis or responses to therapy were seen in different regions of the same tumor, highlighting the limitations of single biopsies commonly used to decide patients  therapies, Sidransky says. In another experiment using blood plasma and sputum from two patients, the researchers extracted DNA from these fluids and used digital polymerase chain reaction, an ultrasensitive method for detecting minute amounts of mutated DNA in a sample, to look for the same mutations they had found in each patient s biopsy samples. They detected those mutations in the fluids   even mutations found in only one specific zone of a lesion. Sidransky says that this finding may indicate that a blood or sputum test could better represent the overall composition of a tumor than a single biopsy sample. Further studies are planned to confirm the findings in more lung cancer patients.  We have a glimpse into the future in which we can detect premalignant lesions in the lung before they become tumors,  says Izumchenko.  But it is only the beginning of a long road we must travel to figure out how to interpret these discoveries to use them optimally in the clinic. ","Published: September 23, 2015"

(Sarah) Du, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Ocean and Mechanical Engineering in FAU's College of Engineering and Computer Science, and principal investigator, will develop a portable smart sensor and a phone application for patients to analyze and store the results of their blood tests on a smart phone. This technology will enable them to keep a close watch on any abnormal activities in their blood cells and take important steps to manage this disease with early intervention. Sickle cell disease is a hereditary blood disorder that affects red blood cells, distorting their natural disc shape into a crescent moon or ""sickle"" shape. Normal red blood cells move freely through small vessels throughout the body to deliver oxygen. With sickle cell disease, the misshapen red blood cells become hard and sticky, making it difficult for them to move through blood vessels. They eventually block the flow and break apart. This process results in a number of problems including severe chronic pain, stroke, organ damage, spleen dysfunction, heart failure and even death. ""A major challenge in the management of sickle cell disease is the tremendous pain that patients endure from chronic and acute pain episodes called pain crisis,"" said Du. ""Unfortunately, these pain episodes are unpredictable and patients never know when or where these episodes will take place."" Integrating microfluidics with communication technologies like a smart phone, Du and her collaborators will create a disposable testing platform much like a glucometer that is used by patients who have diabetes. There are currently no such field sensors available for patients with sickle cell disease. By monitoring the activity of their red blood cells, patients will have a potential risk indicator of a pain crisis and therefore take the appropriate steps for early intervention. They will be able to better manage the disease by making sure they are appropriately hydrated and have sufficient oxygen. ""We will only need to use a very small drop of blood from a finger stick that will then be loaded into a microscale channel that is biochemically modified,"" said Du. ""Then, the embedded microprobes inside the channel together with the microprocessor will transmit the signals of blood cells to a patient's cell phone revealing the results of their blood test."" With further development, this sensor technology could be used as an important part of a smart and connected health system for sickle cell disease management. Based on these sensor measurements, patients could potentially receive intervention strategies, feedback and even prescription medications from health care providers. ""This National Science Foundation grant will help Dr. Du advance her important work on sickle cell disease and provide a tool with great clinical utility that will help patients around the world afflicted by this debilitating disease,"" said Javad Hashemi, Ph.D., chair and professor in FAU's Department of Ocean and Mechanical Engineering. Sickle cell disease affects millions of people of many nationalities throughout the world, including both children and adults. In the U.S., it disproportionately affects people of African descent as well as Hispanics and those of Middle Eastern descent. Approximately two million Americans carry this genetic mutation, which affects about 100,000 individuals in the U.S. The most common and serious problems caused by sickle cell disease are anemia, pain and organ failure, and stroke affects about 10 out of 100 children who have this disease. Currently, the life expectancy for patients with sickle cell disease can reach up to 50 years, a dramatic improvement since 1973, when the average lifespan for the disease was only 14 years. Current treatment options for sickle cell disease include hydroxyurea, blood transfusions, antibiotics, and pain killers. When the two-year NSF project is completed, Du plans on collaborating with health partners to collect longitudinal cell sickling data from individual patients. These measurements will be compared to patients' clinical outcomes to establish criteria for prediction of pain crises.","Published: September 23, 2015"

They recommend it should now be the first choice for such patients, and say that   for most   this well-known but under-valued drug will bring their condition fully under control. The discovery could have a profound impact globally, since hypertension, a major contributor to stroke and heart disease, is so common, affecting as many as one in three adults in some countries. It challenges what the authors describe as ""a growing perception"" that severe hypertension was beyond the control of existing drug treatments, and gives more clues into what causes the condition. The latest research emerged from the PATHWAY-2 trial, part of the PATHWAY programme of trials in hypertension funded by the British Heart Foundation and led by Professor Morris Brown, professor of clinical pharmacology at Cambridge University and a Fellow of Gonville & Caius College. The findings are drawn from what authors Brown and Professor Bryan Williams of University College London describe as an experimental ""shoot-out"" between three different drugs used by doctors for years to treat patients if the standard initial cocktail of three hypertension drugs do  not work. Spironolactone 'slugged it out' against a betablocker (bisoprolol) and an alpha-blocker (doxazosin) in the trial, which took six years and involved 314 patients in 14 different centres. The patients all suffered from resistant high blood pressure that had not responded to the standard treatment for hypertension: a combination of three drugs (an ACE-inhibitor (or angiotensin-receptor blocker), a calcium channel blocker and a thiazide-type diuretic). They continued with this basic combination thoughout, but each of the three trial drugs   and a placebo   was added one at a time, in random order, for 12 weeks each. In what is known as a ""double blind"" trial, neither the patients nor the researchers knew which patient was taking which drug when. In a pioneering step, the study also used patients' own blood pressure readings taken at home to minimise so-called ""white coat syndrome"", in which the stress of being in a clinic causes blood pressure to rise artificially. Once the resulting data had been analysed, it emerged that almost three quarters of patients in the trial saw a major improvement in blood pressure on spironolactone, with almost 60% hitting a particularly stringent measure of blood pressure control. Of the three drugs trialled, spironolactone was the best at lowering blood pressure in 60% of patients, whereas bisoprolol and doxazosin were the best drug in only 17% and 18% respectively. ""Spironolactone annihilated the opposition,"" said Brown. ""Most patients came right down to normal blood pressure while taking it."" He added: ""This is an old drug which has been around for a couple of generations that has resurfaced and is almost a wonder drug for this group of patients. In future it will stimulate us to look for these patients at a much earlier stage so we can treat and maybe even cure them before resistant hypertension occurs."" Doctors appear to have been wary of giving patients spironolactone because it raises the level of potassium in the body. But the study revealed the rise to be only marginal and not dangerous. The causes of resistant of hypertension are still poorly understood, but one theory is that the condition could be the result of sodium retention: too much salt in the body. Spironolactone is a diuretic and helps the body get rid of salt. In the trial, it worked even better than average on patients whom tests showed had high salt levels. Brown said the findings appeared to confirm that, in most patients with resistant hypertension, excessive salt was the problem, probably caused by too much of the adrenal hormone aldosterone. Instead of seeing the treatment-resistant form of high blood pressure as simply the result of having the condition for a long time or of poor treatment, it should be regarded as a different sub-group of hypertension which would need different investigations and treatments, Brown said.","Published: September 23, 2015"

The discovery provides a new platform for drug delivery systems and an entirely different view of cellular functions. The advance was made by researchers at Duke University and is the first time that scientists have reported the ability to create biological structures that are readily programmed to assemble and disassemble. With this knowledge in hand, researchers have opened a new world for designer proteins and investigations into nanotechnology, biotechnology and medical treatments.The study investigated several triggers that can cause protein structures to assemble or break apart, but it primarily focused on heat. Protein-based structures that self-assemble when heated and remain stable inside of the bloodstream have long been used in a variety of applications. The opposite behavior, however, has long eluded researchers, especially outside of the carefully controlled environment of a chemistry lab.  Nobody has been able to make these kinds of materials with the degree of complexity that we have now demonstrated,  said Felipe Garcia Quiroz, a former graduate student in Chilkoti s laboratory and first author of the new study. Chilkoti s lab has designed self-assembling proteins for drug delivery systems for several years. Simply by adding heat, these new packing materials put themselves together and help control where and when drugs are released inside the body through non-temperature-related mechanisms such as changes in acidity levels. With the new discovery, however, drugs could be encapsulated in protein cages that accumulate inside of a tumor and dissolve once heated. Not only would this provide a more accurate way of delivering drugs, but the cages themselves could be used therapeutically.  These packaging systems have always been inert, but now we can make these materials from bioactive components,  said Quiroz.  Once the cages get there and deliver their cargo, they could break down into additional therapeutic agents. We can now design two things into one.  The research also provides new insights into the everyday functions of cells. Because the laboratory identified the genetic sequences that encode this behavior, they were able to point out a long list of human proteins that likely exhibit it.  This paper shows the incredible richness of peptide sequences that already have this very simple switch,  said Chilkoti. Why they assemble and what function it serves, however, remains an open question.  These findings will be exciting to both the materials science and the biochemistry communities,  said Quiroz.  They ll be able to push the limits of what we know about these kinds of materials and then go back to explore how biology is already making use of them. ","Published: September 23, 2015"

Hypoglycemia can be dangerous if it remains undetected. Children and the elderly with Type 1 diabetes are especially prone to sudden drops in blood sugar. The three-year grant will fund research to:   Identify the signature odorants that are produced in human breath by specific volatile organic compounds created by the metabolic processes that lead to hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar.   Develop a nanosensor array to detect those odorants.   Incorporate the nanosensor array into a portable smart device that transmits health information to the diabetic, caregivers and family members.  Researchers will identify the signature odorants, which are unknown to the medical community, using breath samples collected from patients,  said Mangilal Agarwal, a co-principal investigator. Agarwal directs the Integrated Nanosystems Development Institute and is associate director of research development in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research. The odorants will be verified with diabetes alert dogs that recognize the onset of hypoglycemia from those odorants. Patients would blow into the small device, whose sensor system would then communicate the patient s hypoglycemic status, along with tracking information that provides a historical summary. The research is expected to improve health-monitoring options for people with diabetes, decrease health care costs and improve lifestyles for diabetics. The grant is part of an effort by the federal government to accelerate the development and use of innovative approaches that would support the transformation of health care from reactive and hospital-centered to preventive, proactive, evidence-based and person-centered, focused on well-being rather than disease. The project will provide interdisciplinary research experiences to graduate and undergraduate students. In addition, this project will support participation of underrepresented groups and educational outreach programs for K-12 students and teachers across Indiana and the U.S.  This research is particularly well-suited to an institution like IUPUI, with its focus on health and life sciences, and its ability to marshal experts from across disciplines, including engineering, science, medicine and informatics and computing,  Agarwal said.","Published: September 23, 2015"

This effort, aligned with the National Institute of Health s (NIH) strategy to make technology more widely accessible through public/private partnerships, will result in commercially available assays that quantitatively measure phosphorylated and unmodified proteins known to be involved in cancer signaling pathways. Targeted Proteomics was named ""Method of the Year"" by Nature Methods in 2013, and Dr. Christie Hunter at SCIEX was awarded the Human Proteome Organization's 2013 Science and Technology Award for her contributions to the development and commercialization of this technology. To extend the reach of this technology, and make it more sensitive, and more routine and reproducible, an augmented approach is required over direct-MRM. Immuno-MRM assays combine the best features of immunoassays and mass spectrometry to provide highly reproducible, specific and sensitive quantification of target proteins, including phosphorylated proteins. However, a lack of availability of off-the-shelf content for this technique has been holding the field back, and this partnership aims to redress that.

Health and Ambulance Services Minister Cameron Dick said the investment was an example of the Advance Queensland plan in action.  It encourages collaboration between experts and industry, leading to practical outcomes that can improve the health of Queenslanders,  he said.  This is our part of our Government s plan   to provide for the knowledge-based jobs of the future.  Not only will this grant encourage world-class research coming out of Queensland, but it also has the potential to make the health system considerably more efficient   something in which I as Health Minister am extremely interested.  Mr Dick said a research consortium being co-ordinated by The University of Queensland and consisting of Berghofer QIMR, the CSIRO, the Queensland University of Technology and Queensland Health would receive $5 million a year for the next five years.  This investment will place Queensland alongside world leaders in the use of genomics in healthcare,  he said.  Queensland is already leading the way in many areas of genetics and genomics   for instance in tackling superbugs and antibiotic resistance.  Given that many health conditions have a genetic component, it is clear that genomics will play a major role in the future of healthcare.  Mr Dick said the funding would bring together teams of multidisciplinary researchers and clinicians.  By working together they will discover the best way of using genomic technologies for the benefits of patients,  she said.  It will establish our state as a leader in the use of genomics in healthcare.

These findings have implications for our understanding of, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to, ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer has a high mortality rate, primarily because the disease is difficult to detect in its early stages. The majority of diagnoses   over 80 percent   occur in the late stage, and 70 percent of those cases will be fatal. Scientists know that ovarian cancer metastasis is associated with errors in glycosylation, the process by which a sugar chain attaches to a protein at a specific amino acid. The glycans, or sugar chains, affect a number of cellular processes, and it is difficult to measure differences between normal and cancer-associated glycans in order to determine whether or not they are useful as biomarkers for the disease.  David Muddiman, the Jacob and Betty Belin Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at NC State and corresponding author of a paper describing the work, along with Ph.D. candidate and lead author Elizabeth Hecht and other NC State colleagues, wanted to see if it was possible to measure differences between normal and cancer-associated glycans and identify cancer biomarkers. They obtained 164 blood samples from female patients at the Mayo Clinic:  82 from women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and 82 from cancer-free female patients. Muddiman and Hecht isolated N-glycans (glycans that attach to proteins at the amino acid asparagine) from the patients  plasma and prepared them for analysis with mass spectrometry by labeling them with hydrophobic tags specifically designed to enhance the sensitivity of the test. Their method of hydrophobic tagging, known as Individuality Normalization when Labeling with Glycan Hydrazide Tags, or INLIGHT, makes it easier for the glycans to move into a gas phase where the mass spectrometer can  see  them better. Furthermore, by labeling the control and cancer plasma samples with two similar but chemically unique tags, highly accurate measurements could be obtained. The mass spectrometry results were put into statistical models to determine changes in glycan levels between the control patients and those with cancer. The researchers identified seven N-glycans with different chemical compositions that were statistically significant enough to be considered possible biomarkers.  This was the first time we had used our INLIGHT strategy with biological samples,  says Hecht.  Our testing was sensitive enough to detect differences between the samples that were as low as 17 percent. Most testing can only detect two-fold changes, or a 100 percent increase. So we ve been able to demonstrate that it is possible to detect and study, to a fine level of detail, a very hard-to-detect molecule   and that this molecule may be useful as a biomarker for ovarian cancer.  The researchers also found that number of cancer associated N-glycans did not remain constant over the course of the disease, but could vary from stage to stage.  It seems that our usual and often unstated assumption about the process of disease   that what we use to measure disease progression should either consistently increase or decrease during the course of the illness   is incorrect,  says Muddiman.  The molecular signature of cancer is not a one-way street. ","Published: September 23, 2015"

PEG stands for polyethylene glycol, a synthetic polymer that is attached to proteins. The PEG chain artificially increases the size of the protein and improves its retention in the bloodstream. By remaining longer in the blood stream the protein therapeutic is more effective than normal. Since PEGylation was developed in the 1970s, PEGylated proteins have significantly improved the treatment of several chronic diseases, including hepatitis C, leukemia, arthritis, and Crohn s disease. PEGylated interferon is one of the most powerful therapeutics used to treat chronic hepatitis. Despite their importance the structure of PEGylated proteins has remained elusive. Now the first crystal structure of a protein modified with a single PEG chain has been determined through research at NUI Galway. This important research was developed at NUI Galway by Italian PhD student Giada Cattani working with Dr. Peter Crowley, the lead author of the paper. The work also involved collaboration with Dr. Lutz Vogeley from the School of Biochemistry and Immunology at Trinity College Dublin and the crucial X-ray data was collected at the Diamond synchrotron in Oxford, UK. Commenting on the research findings Dr. Peter Crowley from the School of Chemistry, NUI Galway commented,  The crystal structure reveals an extraordinary double helical arrangement of the protein! It is significant that this data was obtained at NUI Galway, the only Irish University to offer a degree programme in Biopharmaceutical Chemistry. This attractive programme provides training in an area that is essential for the development of new medicines and contributes to the Irish economy.  A common approach to understand proteins is to crystallize them and determine their structure by using X-ray crystallography. This is necessary to understand what the protein looks like and how it functions. Thousands of research papers have been published about PEGylated proteins. Until the recent findings at NUI Galway there had been no success in  crystallizing a PEGylated protein. The knowledge obtained by the Crowley lab has implications for understanding how PEGylated proteins work. The NUI Galway team is also looking at ways to engineer protein assemblies based on this result.","Published: September 23, 2015"

Although Prof. Sebastian B cker and his team at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany, have nothing to do with 'Crime Scene Investigation', these bioinformaticians are experienced readers of trails. They hunt for molecular structures of metabolites, which are chemical compounds that determine the metabolism of organisms. ""Metabolites can provide detailed information about the state of living cells, provided that researchers are successful in identifying and quantifying the multitude of metabolites"", Prof. B cker explains. This process is highly complex and seldom leads to conclusive results. However, the work of scientists all over the world who are engaged in this kind of fundamental research has now been made much easier: The bioinformatics team led by Prof. B cker in Jena, together with their collaborators from the Aalto-University in Espoo, Finland, have developed a search engine that significantly simplifies the identification of molecular structures of metabolites. They have coined their search engine 'CSI:FingerID'.  In this case CSI stands for Compound Structure Identification and is based on combining a variety of methods. To begin with, metabolite samples to be analysed undergo a so-called tandem mass spectrometry run. ""During this step, molecules are dismantled into smaller fragments and their molecular weights are identified,"" B cker explains. The resulting spectra give information about the chemical composition of metabolites, but this information is not yet adequate to draw conclusions about the molecular structure. This is where the newly developed search engine comes into play. It works in a similar way to an internet search engine, but instead of searching for keywords, the tool looks for molecular information which translates the given mass spectrum into a structural formula. After the mass spectrum has been submitted to the search engine, 'CSI:FingerID' trawls a number of online molecular structure databases, where scientists throughout the world publish information and structural formulae of both newly discovered and long-known metabolites. A single 'CSI:FingerID' search results in a list of possible candidate structures which best correspond to the spectrum. Reduce the Number of Possible Compounds ""After obtaining the list of possible candidates we still don't know with absolute certainty which metabolite we are dealing with. But when we can reduce the number of possible compounds from several thousand down to perhaps ten, then this is huge progress"", says B cker. ""Because precise lab tests to identify compounds can be expensive and time-consuming, so distinguishing among thousands of possibilities is usually impossible - but testing just ten compounds is often feasible."" And, as the relevant databases also grow constantly - with an average of ten entries being added per minute on a worldwide basis - the search results become consistently more precise. The bioinformaticians show in this new study that they obtain a significantly higher hit ratio with their method than any other method that has been used so far. To this end, they have validated their search engine with more than 6,000 test substances. As well as using 'CSI:FingerID' themselves to analyse naturally occurring metabolites, Prof. B cker and his Jena team have made the search engine freely available to the international scientific community.","Published: September 23, 2015"

He removed himself from a stressful environment by sleeping for decades, and awoke to a changed world; similarly, the biocrust s microbes lie dormant for long periods until precipitation (such as a sudden downpour) awakens them. Understanding more about the interactions between the microbial communities also called  microbiomes in the biocrusts and their adaptations to their harsh environments could provide important clues to help shed light on the roles of soil microbes in the global carbon cycle.  In support of DOE s mission to untangle the complexities of the carbon cycle, we re using the biocrust system to examine the specific metabolites in soil and how microbes target these compounds,  said Trent Northen, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI), a DOE Office of Science User Facility.  Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and soil microbes are typically studied as broad groups, and we wanted to examine the specific relationship between the diversity of soils metabolites and the diversity of microbes. In a recently published study a team led by Northen used seven bacterial isolates from desert biocrusts, one of them the cyanobacterium Microcoleus vaginatus  sequenced by the DOE JGI that had been the focus of earlier work. The isolates were cultivated in what Northen describes as  a virtual smorgasbord  of metabolites containing almost 500 compounds until they stopped growing. Northen and his collaborators deployed a set of tools that he calls  exometabolomics  which harnesses the analytical capabilities of the latest mass spectrometry techniques to quantitatively measure how each microbes and the biocrust community transforms complex mixtures of metabolites, in this case, from soil. Community chowdown: the biocrust buffet  Traditionally, researchers have applied broad categories when studying soil carbon and microbes, like grouping the foods and people at a buffet into broad groups and measuring the total calories each group of people eats,  said Northen.  But people at a buffet don t all eat the same things; vegetarians won t touch the meats, others are allergic to gluten and so on. In the same way, the biocrusts are a big buffet and we find in our study that they each use different fractions of DOC, so it takes a community to consume a buffet.   We were surprised to find that the diverse microbes we examined each targeted specific metabolites, where individual isolates only used a small range 13-26 percent of the metabolites,  says the study s first author Richard Baran also from Berkeley Lab. Even more surprising to the research team was the lack of overlap in the microbes  substrate preferences, where only a few metabolites were consumed by all.  This may be an important mechanism to help support diverse microbes in soil,  said Northen.  If each type of microbes targets unique metabolites they could avoid pure competition by specialization, yet in aggregate they metabolize complex carbon pools. By eating different items on the menu, the metabolites could be helping to support more microbial diversity.  Another observation Northen noted from these results is that in many cases, metabolites that are found to be released by one microbe are consumed by another. The discovery suggests that there may be a food web in the biocrusts microbiomes in which individual microbes may depend on each other for specific metabolites.  Essentially, microbes won t eat each other s lunch if they depend on the other for a specific metabolite,  Northen said, describing this possible mechanism in support of soil biodiversity. Linking genomics with microbial metabolism Though the biocrusts that the team focused on in this paper comprise a fairly simple model system, they say they plan to apply exometabolomics to more complex soil systems and more microbes.  What we re really trying to define is what is the connection between the diversity of metabolites and microbial diversity? What are the specific compounds, and how are those specific compounds transformed by specific microbes,  said Northen.  This is exometabolomics.  The team s long-term goal is to develop exometabolomics as a predictive tool. By linking sequence data with soil carbon cycling, Northen said, researchers could, for example, take a metagenome and predict what metabolites are present in the environment.  This novel application of metabolomics to microbial ecology,  said Ferran Garcia-Pichel, Dean of Natural Sciences, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Arizona State University and one of the paper s senior authors,  is especially exciting because it brings about the potential to directly link modern genomic advances with much of the traditional knowledge of microbial metabolism, with added value to both.

The paper, which will be invaluable for clinical genomics and translational research, makes large-scale gene variation from exome sequence data from the UK general population, openly available for the first-time. Titled  The ICR1000 UK exome series: a resource of gene variation in an outbred population , the study has been led by Professor Nazneen Rahman and colleagues from the Division of Genetics & Epidemiology at the Institute of Cancer Research and has been published on open science platform F1000Research http://f1000research.com/articles/4-883/v1. It includes 1,000 people in the UK, who are part of the 1958 Birth Cohort - a study which follows the lives of 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week in 1958. The study by Professor Nazneen Rahman and colleagues provides a baseline of gene variation in a general population and, unlike most published exome series, the individual exome sequences are available for use by other researchers, on application to the 1958 Birth Cohort committee. Other clinical data and samples are also available regarding these individuals which increases the potential usefulness of the exome data to other researchers whilst ensuring anonymity for the individuals. A high quality analysis pipeline was applied to the data including accurate detection of indels, a very important class of gene variation that can cause disease. This sets the study apart from many other datasets which exclude all or some indels because they have proved tricky to identify, or state that indel calling is not of a high quality. Professor Nazneen Rahman said:  We have analyzed all the genes in 1,000 members of the general UK population. It has proved invaluable to us in both our disease gene discovery research and our work to translate gene testing into the clinic.  We have found this data to be of tremendous value and it continues to be useful for us every day. Hundreds of research and clinical laboratories are doing similar work and we thought they would also find it valuable, so we decided to make our data available to them via F1000Research.  Michael Markie, Associate Publisher of F1000Research, said:  Vast quantities of genomic data currently reside in disparate silos making it difficult for scientists to access it and utilize it for their own research.  F1000Research provides a simple and effective way to make genomic data publicly available to further disease research and we hope that more members of the genomic community will embrace it.

Every medical device sold into Europe, irrespective of its classification, must have an up-to-date Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) as part of its Technical File, but guidance, specifically around clinical data, is unclear and not comprehensive enough, resulting in confusion that was only partly assuaged by the 2007 amendment to the Medical Device Directive (MDD). In addition to this, scandals such as Poly Implant Prostheses  use of cheaper, industrial-grade silicone in breast implants and toxic debris from metal-on-metal hip implants, have cast the issue of Medical Device compliance very much into the public eye. Notified Bodies and their handling of CERs are therefore coming under increasing scrutiny, which will further intensify with the introduction of the new Medical Device Regulation (MDR). As a result, manufacturers are wisely running for cover and revisiting their CERs. To support them, Chris Rule, Manager, Solutions Delivery at Maetrics, provides a must-read step-by-step guide to compliance that:   Highlights common sources of non-compliance  Addresses gaps in clinical evaluation guidance  Clearly sets out the clinical evaluation process  Clarifies CER requirements with a simple check-list  Helps manufacturers attain compliance and prepare for future regulatory changes Providing a key element in the arsenal of any compliant Medical Device manufacturer, this is soon to become the go-to guide on producing compliant CERs and protecting users firm from the consequences of non-compliance.

In order to do this, the white paper clearly and simply defines the main requirements, explains how to set out a successful CER and analyses some of the mistakes that are typically made.  Slip ups can be expensive and time consuming, but most of all they can seriously damage your business, so it is vital for firms to ensure that they are well prepared to face inspections and reviews of their Technical Files at any time.

The findings were recently published in Scientific Reports. 'When studying magnetic resonance images of the brains of patients suffering from CRPS, we noticed that the choroid plexus was nearly one-fifth larger in patients than in healthy control subjects,' says Postdoctoral Researcher Guangyu Zhou from Aalto University Department of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering, who analyzed the images. Located in the walls of the brain ventricles, the choroid plexus is best known for producing cerebrospinal fluid, which forms a protective mechanical cushion and immunological buffer for the brain. It also controls the passage of many substances from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid, brain, and spinal cord. 'However, in clinical neuroscience, the functions of choroid plexus beyond cerebrospinal fluid generation have been largely neglected; for example, the size of the choroid plexus is not quantified in routine brain scans,' explains Professor Riitta Hari, who was in charge of the research. 'As the choroid plexus is known to mediate the interaction between inflammation in the periphery of the body and in the brain, it is an interesting and important target for future research of chronic pain and CRPS in particular,' continues Hari. Regional pain syndrome is a chronic and highly debilitating condition that typically develops after a minor trauma, to the hand for example, and then spreads to other areas, such as the whole upper limb and sometimes even to the other side of the body. Thus, it has been suggested earlier that the central nervous system might play an important role in the disease. The scientists measured the volume of the choroid plexus from 3-tesla structural magnetic resonance images. The study involved 32 subjects, half of whom suffered from the syndrome and half of whom were healthy. Aalto University   press release Hari R et al.

Reporting in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the team describes a new approach for predicting developmental neurotoxicity that uses stem cells to model features of the developing human brain that could be targeted by toxic chemicals or drugs. The research also is important to addressing growing concerns about the rising incidence worldwide of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and the potential role of environmental chemicals. First, the team produced a model human neural tissue by culturing stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells, vascular cells, and microglia on engineered hydrogels.  These precursor cells self-assembled into three-dimensional neural tissue constructs with features that resemble the developing human brain. Such tissues are often referred to as  organoids.     Several things about this project surprised us,  says Michael Schwartz, an assistant scientist in biomedical engineering at UW-Madison and co-lead author of the study with Zhonggang Hou of the Morgridge Institute (now a researcher at Harvard University).  In the beginning, we weren t expecting the kind of complex neural tissues that were ultimately developed.  RNA-sequencing data was collected from neural tissue constructs that were individually exposed to 60 different  training  chemicals   both safe compounds and known toxins   and machine learning was used to build a predictive model from these results.  The algorithm proved remarkably accurate: After training with known chemicals using duplicate samples and two time points (240 neural constructs in total), the model correctly classified nine out of 10 additional chemicals in a blinded trial. Schwartz says that this new screening method offers a valuable bridge between testing a single layer of cells in a dish and testing on animals.  These model neural tissues capture a lot more of the complexity than you would find in a monolayer of cells,  he says.  They also mimic human physiology, and should be more relevant for predicting toxicity than animal models. The fact that we could apply a machine learning model to achieve 90 percent accuracy this early in the process is fantastic.  This project reflects a diverse collaboration between the Morgridge Institute s regenerative biology team, led by stem cell pioneer James Thomson, and leading UW-Madison experts in tissue engineering and machine learning. Biomedical Engineering Professor William Murphy led the development of synthetic  hydrogels,  or matrices that enable stem cells to grow naturally and self-assemble into a complex network of tissues. And Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Professor David Page developed the predictive model using two types of holdout-testing methods.  This project illustrates why Wisconsin is such a great place to do research,  says Schwartz.  The opportunity to collaborate with such a talented and diverse group of people makes coming to work a lot more fun.    Thomson says the Wisconsin project has potential to improve drug testing, but with more than 100,000 mostly untested chemical compounds used in commerce, the impact could be even greater for screening chemicals.  The current toxicity screening tests use multi-generational rat studies and cost about $1 million to test one chemical,  he says.  So we need a really high-throughput way to test these compounds, figure out which ones may be the bad actors, then focus on those with more traditional methods.  Schwartz says the RNA sequencing data generated by this study will be beneficial to future studies by helping to identify potential toxic profiles or fingerprints.  These datasets provide valuable information about changes in gene expression that researchers can mine to better understand mechanisms that might be disrupted during human brain development,  he says. One unique element of the project is the level of consistency achieved across hundreds of samples   especially given the cellular diversity of the neural tissue model, which included neurons, glial cells, interconnected vascular networks, and microglia, which is the immune cell of central nervous system.  The neural tissue constructs developed in this project are the first to incorporate vascular and microglial components into a 3D model of brain development derived from human pluripotent stem cells. The synthetic material used to help the tissues grow was a key part of the early success of this work.   These hydrogels are minimally complex in that they only present peptides that allow the cells to attach and degrade the matrix. The cells will do the rest of the work on their own   biology does a better job forming tissues than we do,  Schwartz says. In the original proposal, Thomson notes that  if appropriately specified, precursor cells are brought together in the right environment, a degree of self-assembly, differentiation, and maturation will occur.  The synthetic materials used to culture the cells were key to achieving the consistency needed to successfully screen so many samples.

In laboratory studies, scientists demonstrated that activating a specific family of proteins halted cancer cell migration into healthy tissue. GBM is the most common brain tumor in adults; in 2010, there were 22,000 cases in the U.S. People with GBM often live fewer than 15 months following diagnosis because, despite surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, individual cancer cells escape and invade healthy surrounding tissue, making additional treatment attempts increasingly difficult.  New therapies for GBM are desperately needed,  said UT Assistant Professor Kathryn Eisenmann, Ph.D., corresponding author on the study.  We hope our latest finding will lead to a novel and effective treatment for this extremely aggressive cancer.  The study, published online by the American Society of Cell Biology in the journal Molecular Biology of the Cell, expands upon an earlier discovery by VARI Professor Arthur Alberts, Ph.D., of a bioactive peptide called DAD and small molecules called intramimics. Both DAD and intramimics activate a family of proteins called DIAPHs or mDIA, which are known to play vital roles in GBM spread. Eisenmann s team, led by first author and M.D./Ph.D. graduate student Jessica Arden, showed that locking DIAPH into an  on  state using DAD, intramimic-01 and intramimic-02 stops GBM cells from invading normal brain tissue.  Metastatic tumor cells are like any moving vehicle all of the wheels need to be pointed in the right direction when power is applied,  said Alberts, a senior author on the study.  DIAPHs build the structures that hold and point all the wheels moving cells in the right direction. Dr. Eisenmann s data suggests that DIAPH activation or  agonism  locks all wheels into arbitrary directions, so no matter how hard you push the pedal down, the tumor cells won t move.  Historically, therapies aimed at combating the spread of GBM focused on inhibiting mDIA, a member of the DIAPH family that is integrally involved in cell structure and tumor motility. Earlier work in the the Alberts Laboratory also showed that intramimics could impair tumor growth in colon cancer cells and that they could be a potential therapeutic option for other cancers as well. Little work had been done on molecules that activate mDIA as an anti-GBM therapy, prompting the recent study comparing mDIA activation versus inhibition in GBM. Alberts and Eisenmann hope to soon evaluate the effectiveness of this new strategy in preclinical models, a crucial step in translating this discovery to the clinic and patients.  GBM is lethal because it so effectively escapes and evades therapy,  Eisenmann said.  Our hope is this discovery will prove to be an anti-tumor strategy and one that will be safe and effective for patients.  Van Andel Research Institute   press release Eisenmann KM et al.

The research also is important to addressing growing concerns about the rising incidence worldwide of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and the potential role of environmental chemicals.   First, the team produced a model human neural tissue by culturing stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells, vascular cells, and microglia on engineered hydrogels. These precursor cells self-assembled into three-dimensional neural tissue constructs with features that resemble the developing human brain. Such tissues are often referred to as ""organoids.""  ""Several things about this project surprised us,"" says Michael Schwartz, an assistant scientist in biomedical engineering at UW-Madison and co-lead author of the study with Zhonggang Hou of the Morgridge Institute (now a researcher at Harvard University). ""In the beginning, we weren't expecting the kind of complex neural tissues that were ultimately developed."" RNA sequencing data was collected from neural tissue constructs that were individually exposed to 60 different ""training"" chemicals - both safe compounds and known toxins - and machine learning was used to build a predictive model from these results.  The algorithm proved remarkably accurate: After training with known chemicals using duplicate samples and two time points (240 neural constructs in total), the model correctly classified nine out of 10 additional chemicals in a blinded trial.  Schwartz says this new screening method offers a valuable bridge between testing a single layer of cells in a dish and testing on animals. ""These model neural tissues capture a lot more of the complexity than you would find in a monolayer of cells,"" he says. ""They also mimic human physiology, and should be more relevant for predicting toxicity than animal models. The fact that we could apply a machine learning model to achieve 90 percent accuracy this early in the process is fantastic."" This project reflects a diverse collaboration between the Morgridge Institute's regenerative biology team, led by stem cell pioneer James Thomson, and leading UW-Madison experts in tissue engineering and machine learning. Biomedical engineering Professor William Murphy led the development of synthetic ""hydrogels,"" or matrices that enable stem cells to grow naturally and self-assemble into a complex network of tissues. And biostatistics and medical informatics Professor David Page developed the predictive model using two types of holdout-testing methods. Thomson says the Wisconsin project has potential to improve drug testing, but with more than 100,000 mostly untested chemical compounds used in commerce, the impact could be even greater for screening chemicals. ""The current toxicity screening tests use multi-generational rat studies and cost about $1 million to test one chemical,"" he says. ""So we need a really high-throughput way to test these compounds, figure out which ones may be the bad actors, then focus on those with more traditional methods."" Schwartz says the RNA sequencing data generated by this study will be beneficial to future studies by helping to identify potential toxic profiles or fingerprints. ""These datasets provide valuable information about changes in gene expression that researchers can mine to better understand mechanisms that might be disrupted during human brain development,"" he says. One unique element of the project is the level of consistency achieved across hundreds of samples - especially given the cellular diversity of the neural tissue model, which included neurons, glial cells, interconnected vascular networks, and microglia, which is the immune cell of the central nervous system. The neural tissue constructs developed in this project are the first to incorporate vascular and microglial components into a 3D model of brain development derived from human pluripotent stem cells. The synthetic material used to help the tissues grow was a key part of the early success of this work. ""These hydrogels are minimally complex in that they only present peptides that allow the cells to attach and degrade the matrix. The cells will do the rest of the work on their own - biology does a better job forming tissues than we do,"" Schwartz says.  In the original proposal, Thomson notes that ""if appropriately specified, precursor cells are brought together in the right environment, a degree of self-assembly, differentiation, and maturation will occur."" The synthetic materials used to culture the cells were key to achieving the consistency needed to successfully screen so many samples.","Published: September 22, 2015"

Based on these results, the company plans to submit new drug applications seeking regulatory approval of bezlotoxumab in the U.S., EU and Canada in 2015. Currently, there are no therapies approved for the prevention of recurrent disease caused by C. difficile. Results from the studies were presented for the first time at the Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) and International Congress of Chemotherapy and Infection (ICC) joint meeting in San Diego, Sept. 17-21.  Results of these studies showed that a single, one-time infusion of the antitoxin bezlotoxumab given with standard of care C. difficile antibiotic treatment significantly reduced the recurrence of C. difficile infection compared to standard of care alone, and demonstrated this benefit over a 12-week period,  said Dr. Mark Wilcox, Leeds Teaching Hospitals and University of Leeds, U.K., and a lead investigator for the studies.  These results were also demonstrated in patient subgroups known to be at high risk for C. difficile recurrence.  Bezlotoxumab is not an antibiotic. It is a selective, fully-human, monoclonal antibody designed to neutralize C. difficiletoxin B, a toxin that can damage the gut wall and cause inflammation, leading to the symptoms of C. difficile enteritis, which include abdominal pain and watery diarrhea. Bezlotoxumab was developed by researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School s MassBiologics Laboratory in conjunction with Medarex (now part of Bristol-Myers Squibb), and licensed to Merck in 2009 for development as a potential therapeutic for C. difficile infection.  Recurrence is a major challenge with C. difficile infection, and novel approaches are needed to help prevent the cycle of C. difficile recurrence,  said Dr. Dale Gerding, professor of medicine, Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, Ill., and a lead investigator for the studies.","Published: September 22, 2015"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/targeting-dna-211163,Targeting DNA Protein based sensor could detect viral infection or kill cancer cells   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. MIT biological engineers have developed a modular system of proteins that can detect a particular DNA sequence in a cell and then trigger a specific response, such as cell death. This system can be customized to detect any DNA sequence in a mammalian cell and then trigger a desired response, including killing cancer cells or cells infected with a virus, the researchers say.  There is a range of applications for which this could be important,  says James Collins, the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science in MIT s Department of Biological Engineering and Institute of Medical Engineering and Science (IMES).  This allows you to readily design constructs that enable a programmed cell to both detect DNA and act on that detection, with a report system and/or a respond system. Collins is the senior author of a paper describing the technology, which is based on a type of DNA-binding proteins known as zinc fingers. These proteins can be designed to recognize any DNA sequence.  The technologies are out there to engineer proteins to bind to virtually any DNA sequence that you want,  says Shimyn Slomovic, an IMES postdoc and the paper s lead author.  This is used in many ways, but not so much for detection. We felt that there was a lot of potential in harnessing this designable DNA-binding technology for detection.  Sense and respond To create their new system, the researchers needed to link zinc fingers  DNA-binding capability with a consequence   either turning on a fluorescent protein to reveal that the target DNA is present or generating another type of action inside the cell. The researchers achieved this by exploiting a type of protein known as an  intein    a short protein that can be inserted into a larger protein, splitting it into two pieces. The split protein pieces, known as  exteins,  only become functional once the intein removes itself while rejoining the two halves. Collins and Slomovic decided to divide an intein in two and then attach each portion to a split extein half and a zinc finger protein. The zinc finger proteins are engineered to recognize adjacent DNA sequences within the targeted gene, so if they both find their sequences, the inteins line up and are then cut out, allowing the extein halves to rejoin and form a functional protein. The extein protein is a transcription factor designed to turn on any gene the researchers want. In this paper, they linked green fluorescent protein (GFP) production to the zinc fingers  recognition of a DNA sequence from an adenovirus, so that any cell infected with this virus would glow green. This approach could be used not only to reveal infected cells, but also to kill them. To achieve this, the researchers could program the system to produce proteins that alert immune cells to fight the infection, instead of GFP.  Since this is modular, you can potentially evoke any response that you want,  Slomovic says.  You could program the cell to kill itself, or to secrete proteins that would allow the immune system to identify it as an enemy cell so the immune system would take care of it.  The MIT researchers also deployed this system to kill cells by linking detection of the DNA target to production of an enzyme called NTR. This enzyme activates a harmless drug precursor called CB 1954, which the researchers added to the petri dish where the cells were growing. When activated by NTR, CB 1954 kills the cells. Future versions of the system could be designed to bind to DNA sequences found in cancerous genes and then produce transcription factors that would activate the cells  own programmed cell death pathways. Research tool The researchers are now adapting this system to detect latent HIV proviruses, which remain dormant in some infected cells even after treatment. Learning more about such viruses could help scientists find ways to permanently eliminate them.  Latent HIV provirus is pretty much the final barrier to curing AIDS, which currently is incurable simply because the provirus sequence is there, dormant, and there aren t any ways to eradicate it,  Slomovic says. While treating diseases using this system is likely many years away, it could be used much sooner as a research tool, Collins says. For example, scientists could use it to test whether genetic material has been successfully delivered to cells that scientists are trying to genetically alter. Cells that did not receive the new gene could be induced to undergo cell death, creating a pure population of the desired cells. It could also be used to study chromosomal inversions and transpositions that occur in cancer cells, or to study the 3-D structure of normal chromosomes by testing whether two genes located far from each other on a chromosome fold in such a way that they end up next to each other, the researchers say.","Published: September 22, 2015"

Named for its discovery near the Italian beach town of Lignano Sabbiadoro, this tiny worm can regenerate almost its whole body following an injury, and researchers have long been trying to understand how it s able to pull off this trick.  A team of researchers has for the first time characterized the flatworm s genome, paving the way for a host of new studies of the worm and its regenerative capabilities. The team was led by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Professor and HHMI Investigator Gregory Hannon, also a Professor and Senior Group Leader at the CRUK Cambridge Institute at the University of Cambridge, and CSHL Associate Professor Michael Schatz. This flatworm can regenerate every part of its body except the brain,  says Hannon. He was studying an important pathway in mammalian reproductive tissues when he became interested in Macrostomum.  This and other regenerating flatworms have the same kind of pathway operating in stem cells that is responsible for their remarkable regenerative capabilities.  As we started to try to understand the biology of these stem cells, it very quickly became clear that we needed information about the genetic content of these organisms.  M. lignano turned out to have an unusually complex genome filled with repetitive elements that made it challenging to assemble and analyze, says Schatz.  At the genomic level it has almost no relationship to anything else that's ever been sequenced. It's very strange and unique in that sense.  To overcome the extreme genomic complexity, the team used new long-read sequencing technology that boosted the quality of the genome sequence obtained by more than one hundred fold over standard short-read approaches. The researchers used the worm s genomic information to study how gene expression changed during regeneration.  It's a very powerful tool to be able to see the genes that get activated that are responsible for regeneration of the animal,  Schatz explains.  We think this is going to be a very important species for stem cell research.    The flatworm is ideal for studying stem cells, says lead author Kaja Wasik, who conducted the work as a PhD student in Hannon s lab along with co-lead author James Gurtowski from Schatz s lab.  The worms are just like floating sacks full of stem cells, so they're very easily accessible,  says Wasik.  From what we looked at, it looks like many of the developmental pathways that are present in humans are also present in the worms, and we can now study whether they potentially could be involved in regeneration.  According to co-author Peter Ladurner, an assistant professor at the University of Innsbruck, the worm has many properties that make it a good model system:  M. lignano is small, has simple tissues and organs, is transparent, and has sexual reproduction.  Well before its genome was available, M. lignano was already being studied for its insights into stem cells and tissue differentiation. The availability of the genome now enables researchers to do a lot of things they couldn t previously, such as search within the genome, have a list of genes in hand, and gain insights into the worm s genome organization. Hannon says detailed analyses will be needed to figure out how the flatworm s stem cells are able to develop into a variety of different cell types. He is also planning to examine how the pathways he has studied in other organisms operate in the worms.  The goal of this project was to enable ourselves and others to do new biology. The hope is that as these tools become more available, the community will grow.  About 15 international research groups on three continents are actively working on Macrostomum flatworms, says co-author Lukas Sch rer from the University of Basel. Sch rer says he and Ladurner played a major role in helping to develop a broader Macrostomum research community.  The worm was initially used as a model to study embryology and neurobiology, and starting in the late 1990s research expanded into stem cell biology, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration, topics that are still very actively studied today,  he says.  We fully expect that the publication of the genome will lead to a surge in interest in this versatile model organism. ","Published: September 22, 2015"

Now, breaching the next frontier in 3D printing, Jennifer A. Lewis, Sc.D., has designed new systems to actively mix and print concentrated viscoelastic inks that, for the first time, allow for the simultaneous control of composition and geometry during printing. Lewis is a Core Faculty member at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University and the Hansj rg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). The goal of integrating different material and structural properties within printed objects has demanded the invention of new, flexible printing platforms. For example, to print a functional ""wearable"" device including its electronic components, a 3D printer would need to seamlessly transition from the flexible material that moves with the wearer s joints to the rigid material that holds the electronic components. It would also need to embed electrical circuitry with multiple inks of varying conductivity and resistivity, precisely switching between them. And, it would be ideal to do all of this inside one continuous print job with active mixing of complex fluids. But until now, most mixing approaches are passive, so that two streams of fluids converge into a single channel where they undergo diffusive mixing. This method works well with thin, flowing fluids with low-viscosity, but is ineffective with thicker, high-viscosity fluids like gels, especially in small volumes over short periods of time. To address this challenge, Lewis and her team designed a new multimaterial printhead based on active mixing, Her team included Thomas Ober, former Postdoctoral Research Scholar at the Wyss Institute and SEAS; and Daniele Foresti, Postdoctoral Fellow at SEAS. The work was published September 21 in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). ""Passive mixtures don t guarantee perfectly mixed materials, especially highly viscous inks,"" said Ober, the paper s first author. ""We developed a rational framework   and verified it experimentally   for designing active microfluidic mixers that can mix a wide variety of materials."" The active printhead efficiently mixes a wide range of complex fluids by using a rotational component inside a microscale nozzle, which enabled the team to print heterogeneous materials in three dimensions.The research team demonstrated several uses of their active mixing technology. They showed that silicone rubber can be seamlessly printed into gradient architectures composed of soft and rigid regions. These structures may find potential application in flexible electronics, wearable devices, and soft robotics. They also printed reactive materials, such as two-part epoxies, which typically harden quickly when the two parts are combined. Finally, they showed that conductive and resistive inks could be mixed on demand to embed electrical circuitry inside 3D printed objects. ""Jennifer s latest technical advance enables fabrication of objects composed of different types of materials that are absolutely required for optimal function, yet could not be integrated seamlessly into a single unitary object with 3D printing in the past,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital as well as Professor of Bioengineering at SEAS. ""Her creativity and leadership have already transformed the realm of 3D printing, and once again, she and her team have opened another new path for this emerging field to explore."" Lewis and her team also recently designed another printhead that can rapidly switch between multiple inks within a single nozzle, eliminating the structural defects that often occur during the start-and-stop process of switching materials. ""This printhead design eliminates the need to align multiple nozzles as well as start and stop ink flow on demand,"" said James Hardin, first author of a recently published paper in Advanced Materials that reported the advance. In addition to Hardin, the work included Ober, former SEAS Postdoctoral Research Fellow and current Wyss Staff Scientist Alexander Valentine, and was led by Lewis. ""Together, these active mixing and switching printheads provide an important advance for multimaterial 3D printing,"" said Lewis. ""They allow one to programmably control both materials composition and structure at the microscale, opening new avenues for creating materials by design.""

That includes controlling the movement of molecules in and out using gateways called nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Scientists are paying close attention to this regulation since dysfunction in nuclear transport has been linked to many diseases, including cancers and developmental disorders. While small molecules can easily pass in and out of the nucleus, the transport of large molecules such as proteins and RNA is more complex and less well understood. These are moved through the NPC rapidly, but also selectively to avoid allowing the wrong big molecules through.It was already known that proteins called transport factors bind to large cargo and escort it through the NPC. A team led by Michael P. Rout, a professor at Rockefeller University and head of the Laboratory of Cellular and Structural Biology, and David Cowburn, a professor of biochemistry and of physiology & biophysics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, sought to explain the speed with which transport factors ferry large molecules across the NPC, a process that lasts only a few milliseconds.  It s understood how these transport factors selectively choose and bind to their cargo,  Rout says.  However, it s been unclear how such a specific process can also shepherd molecules through the nuclear pore complex so quickly.  At the center of the NPC, the transport factors and their cargo must pass through a selectivity filter made of proteins called FG Nups. These proteins form a dense mesh that normally prevents large molecules from getting through. Using a technique known as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the researchers collected atomic-scale information about the behavior of the FG Nups, focusing on Nsp1, the most studied representative of the FG Nups. Normally, proteins fold into large structures. Relative to small molecules such as water, these large protein structures move very slowly. This means their interactions are correspondingly slow. The researchers measured the physical state of FG repeats with and without transport factors bound to them. They found that rather than folding like proteins generally do, the FG Nups are loose and string-like, remaining highly dynamic and lacking a predictable structure.  Usually, binding between traditionally folded proteins is a time consuming, cumbersome process, but because the FG Nups are unfolded, they are moving very quickly, very much like small molecules. This means their interaction is very quick,  explains Rout. The disordered structure of the FG regions is critical to the speed of transport, allowing for quick loading and unloading of cargo-carrying transport factors. At the same time, because transport factors have multiple binding sites for FG Nups, they are the only proteins that can specifically interact with them   making transport both fast and specific.  We observed that there is minimal creation of a static well-ordered structure in complexes of FG Nups and transport factors,  says Cowburn.  Our observations are, we propose, the first case where the  fuzzy  property of an interaction is a key part of its actual biological function.  The team hopes this discovery will lead to detailed characterizations of nuclear transport pathways and to more close studies of the NPC s function. Ultimately, a better understanding of how the NPC works will not only provide new insight into the basic biology of cells, but also have implications for health and disease.","Published: September 22, 2015"

This finding opens the door to a completely revolutionary treatment,  said Pilar Ruiz-Lozano, PhD, associate professor of pediatrics at Stanford.  There is currently no effective treatment to reverse the scarring in the heart after heart attacks.  In a heart attack, cardiac muscle cells, called cardiomyocytes, die from a lack of blood flow. Replacing those dead cells is vital for the organ to fully recover. Unfortunately, the adult mammalian heart does not regenerate effectively, causing scar tissue to form. Protein helps regenerate dead heart muscle Heart attacks cause millions of deaths annually worldwide and are predicted to skyrocket in the next few decades   tripling by 2030. About 735,000 Americans suffer a heart attack each year. Many victims now survive the initial injury, thanks to advances in early treatment, but the resulting loss of cardiomyocytes can lead to heart failure and possibly death.  Consequently, most survivors face a long and progressive course of heart failure, with poor quality of life and very high medical costs,  Ruiz-Lozano said. Various methods of transplanting healthy muscle cells into a damaged heart have been tried, but have yet to yield consistent success in promoting healing. Previous heart regeneration studies in zebrafish have shown that the epicardium is one of the driving factors for healing a damaged heart, Ruiz-Lozano said.  We wanted to know what in the epicardium stimulates the myocardium, the muscle of the heart, to regenerate.  Since adult mammalian hearts do not regenerate effectively, they also wanted to know whether epicardial substances might stimulate regeneration in mammalian hearts and restore function after a heart attack. She and her colleagues pinpointed Fstl1, a protein secreted by the epicardium, as a growth factor for cardiomyocytes. Not only did this protein kick-start the proliferation of cardiomyocytes in petri dishes, but the researchers were surprised to find that it was missing from damaged epicardial tissue following heart attacks in humans.  Reintroducing lost protein The researchers set out to reintroduce the protein back into the damaged epicardial tissue of mice and pigs that had suffered a heart attack. They did this by suturing a bioengineered patch, loaded with Fstl1, to the damaged tissue. The patches were made of natural material known as collagen that was structurally modified to mimic certain mechanical properties of the epicardium. Because the patches are made of acellular collagen, meaning they contain no cells, recipients do not need immunosuppressive drugs to avoid rejection. With time, the collagen material gets absorbed into the organ. The researchers believe that the elasticity of the material, which resembles that of the fetal heart, is key to providing a hospitable environment for muscle regrowth. New blood vessels regenerated there as well. There is currently no effective treatment to reverse the scarring in the heart after heart attacks. Within two to four weeks of receiving the patch, heart muscle cells began to proliferate and the animals progressively recovered heart function.  Many were so sick prior to getting the patch that they would have been candidates for heart transplantation,  Ruiz-Lozano said. The hope is that a similar procedure could eventually be used in human heart-attack patients who suffer severe heart damage. The work integrated the efforts of multiple labs around the world, including labs at the Sanford-Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute in San Diego, UC-San Diego, Boston University School of Medicine, Imperial College London and Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences. Stanford has a patent on the patch, and Ruiz-Lozano is chief scientific officer at Epikabio Inc., which has an exclusive option to license this technology.","Published: September 22, 2015"

Of them, 400,000 also have Down syndrome. Both groups have similar looking brains with higher levels of the protein beta amyloid. In fact, patients with Down syndrome develop the abnormal protein at twice the rate.   People with Down syndrome represent the world s largest population of predetermined Alzheimer s disease. By studying these individuals, we can develop insights into how Alzheimer s disease naturally progresses and potential drug targets,  said principal investigator Michael Rafii, MD, PhD, assistant professor of neurosciences and interim co-director of the Alzheimer s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) at UC San Diego.The 3-year study, called the Down Syndrome Biomarker Initiative (DSBI), involved twelve participants between the ages of 30 and 60 with Down syndrome, to study their aging process. The study focused on how soon protein plaques developed, where in the brain they were located and the effects of the plaques on cognition. To quantify how much amyloid was present in the brain, the study included extensive neuroimaging such as volumetric MRI, amyloid PET, FDG PET, and retinal amyloid imaging.  This study shows some of the earliest known Alzheimer s disease biomarker changes in adults with Down syndrome and underscores the need for additional studies,  said Rafii.  This study will set the stage for the first clinical trial of anti-beta amyloid therapy in the preclinical treatment of Alzheimer s disease in adults with Down syndrome.  AD is believed to occur from the toxic buildup of beta amyloid. There are many forms of AD that are genetically inherited, including Down syndrome. People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of the 21st chromosome where the production gene for the beta amyloid protein resides. The ADCS was founded by the late Leon Thal, MD, a world leader in Alzheimer s research, to promote the discovery, development and testing of new drugs for the treatment of AD. It is part of a larger AD research and treatment effort at UC San Diego, which includes the Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer s Disease Research Center, under the direction of Douglas Galasko, MD, and Edward Koo, MD, and the Memory Disorders Clinic, headed by Rafii. Studies of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders at UC San Diego are part of the clinical and bench strength of the UC System. In the past five years, more than 130 UC investigators have conducted 350 research projects in the AD field, receiving roughly $339 million in funding support for both basic research and clinical trials.","Published: September 22, 2015"
